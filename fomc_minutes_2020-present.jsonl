Secretary’s note: The Federal Reserve Bank of New York subsequently sent advice that the selections indicated previously were satisfactory. Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee 3 By unanimous vote, the Committee voted to reaffirm without revision the FOMC Authorizations and Continuing Directives for Open Market Operations. All participants indicated support for, and agreed to abide by, the FOMC Policy on Investment and Trading for Committee Participants and Federal Reserve System Staff, the Program for Security of FOMC Information, the FOMC Policy on External Communications of Committee Participants, and the FOMC Policy on External Communications of Federal Reserve System Staff. The Committee voted unanimously to approve those four policies.2 Review of Monetary Policy Strategy, Tools, and Communications Committee participants began discussions related to their review of the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy framework. This review is focused on two specific areas: the Committee’s Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, which presents the Committee’s approach to the conduct of monetary policy, and the Committee’s policy communication practices. The Committee’s 2 percent longer-run inflation goal will be retained and is not a focus of the review. In support of these discussions, staff briefings provided a retrospective on the Committee’s 2019–20 framework review and summarized the experience abroad in conducting reviews of monetary policy frameworks. The staff presentation began by recapping the creation and evolution of the Committee’s Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy and the context of the Committee’s 2019–20 review. The adoption of the statement in 2012 introduced the Committee’s 2 percent inflation target and codified long-standing practices followed by the Committee and, as such, was an important step in improving the transparency, accountability, and predictability of U.S. monetary policymaking. The launch of the 2019–20 review was motivated in part by a desire to evaluate the experience of the Global Financial Crisis and its aftermath. During this period, inflation had run persistently below the Committee’s 2 percent objective, even as the unemployment rate and interest rates remained low. These developments indicated a greater risk that the federal funds rate would be constrained by its effective lower bound (ELB) more often in the future, posing challenges to the achievement of the Committee’s dual-mandate goals over the medium term. The staff summarized the scope and components of the 2019–20 review, including its outreach to a broad range of individuals and groups, and the rationale behind the changes made to the statement at the end of the review. In summarizing the international experience, the staff noted that occasional reviews of monetary policy frameworks were seen as useful in adapting to evolving economic environments, promoting transparency, and fostering public understanding and, therefore, were becoming the norm in advanced economies. Reviews abroad had covered various aspects related to monetary policy goals, 4 January 28–29, 2025 strategies, tools, communications, forecasting, and governance, with some of the recent reviews giving particular attention to topics such as the experience of the COVID–19 pandemic, the ensuing global inflation episode, and the conduct and communication of monetary policy in times of unusual uncertainty. Participants viewed the statement as having played an important role in building a common understanding among policymakers of the congressionally mandated monetary policy goals and of their monetary policy strategy. The statement and other means of policy communication also figured importantly in conveying that understanding to the public and helping to anchor inflation expectations, thereby supporting the effective transmission of monetary policy. Participants indicated that they were looking forward to their discussions at upcoming meetings and to hearing a range of perspectives at various Fed Listens events as well as at a planned research conference, and that they were approaching the review with open minds. Participants noted that the economic consequences of the COVID–19 pandemic were largely unforeseen at the time of the 2019–20 review and that the current economic environment differed greatly from the period leading up to that review, which was characterized in part by persistently low inflation and interest rates. In light of the experience of the past five years, participants assessed that it was important to consider potential revisions to the statement, with particular attention to some of the elements introduced in 2020. Participants highlighted as areas of consideration the statement’s focus on the risks to the economy posed by the ELB, the approach of mitigating shortfalls from maximum employment, and the approach of aiming to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent following periods of persistently below-target inflation. Participants emphasized the need for the FOMC’s monetary policy framework to be robust to a wide range of economic circumstances. They noted that economic uncertainty—including about the values of the longer-run neutral policy rate, the economy’s potential growth rate, and the level of maximum employment—would remain an important factor affecting their decisionmaking. Participants also mentioned aspects of the statement that they thought should continue to be emphasized—including the Committee’s firm commitment to achieving maximum employment and 2 percent inflation, as well as the importance of keeping longer-term inflation expectations well anchored. Participants expected that their discussions related to the framework review would continue at upcoming meetings. They expected the review to wrap up by late summer and intended to report the outcomes of the review to the public. Developments in Financial Markets and Open Market Operations The manager turned first to a review of developments in financial markets. Over the intermeeting period, broad equity price indexes had declined moderately, credit spreads had remained very tight, Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee 5 and the trade-weighted value of the dollar had risen slightly. In considering the expected path of the federal funds rate, the manager noted that the modal policy rate path implied by options prices had not changed appreciably on net over the intermeeting period and was broadly consistent with a single quarter-point lowering of the target range for the federal funds rate taking place during 2025. The average rate path implied by futures prices was also little changed and was above the corresponding median rates in the December 2024 Summary of Economic Projections. The modal path implied by the Open Market Desk’s Survey of Market Expectations shifted up somewhat over the intermeeting period, with respondents generally judging that policy rate reductions would occur later than previously assessed, and was broadly consistent with market-implied paths at horizons up to early 2026. Beyond that period, however, the survey-based path was notably below the market-implied path. This discrepancy likely partly reflected positive market risk premiums as well as survey biases. In their expectations of Federal Reserve balance sheet policy, survey respondents on average saw the process of runoff concluding by mid-2025, slightly later than they had previously expected. The manager next considered the recent behavior of Treasury yields. Longer-term nominal Treasury yields had risen sharply following the Committee’s December meeting and the release of the unexpectedly strong December payrolls report. Subsequently, a partial retracing of this increase took place after consumer price index (CPI) data indicated that prices rose more slowly than expected in December. Over the intermeeting period, longer-dated Treasury yields rose 15 to 20 basis points, while shorter-dated yields were little changed. The manager discussed staff analysis that had aimed at decomposing the increase of nearly 100 basis points in longer-term Treasury yields that had taken place since mid-September 2024. That analysis suggested an upward revision in financial markets’ evaluation of the path of the real policy rate required to achieve the Committee’s goals, especially at longer horizons. Nevertheless, much of the increase in real yields was in real term premiums, likely reflecting uncertainty about the policy rate trajectory as well as a number of other factors. The manager noted that measures of inflation compensation had generally risen slightly. However, both survey measures of inflation expectations and pricing in the Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities market remained broadly consistent with the anticipation that inflation would return to the Committee’s 2 percent inflation objective. With respect to money markets, the manager noted that December’s quarter-point lowering of the target range for the federal funds rate had been fully passed through to other short-term interest rates. In addition, the 5 basis point technical adjustment to the overnight reverse repurchase agreement (ON RRP) offering rate implemented in December appeared to have been transmitted nearly in full to repurchase agreement (repo) rates. Money market conditions had been orderly over year-end, with the technical adjustment to the ON RRP offering rate directly contributing to a lower rate environment by keeping repo rates below the values that would have otherwise prevailed. 6 January 28–29, 2025 Throughout the week of year-end, the Desk conducted standing repo facility (SRF) auctions each morning, in addition to the regular afternoon auctions. Although there was no take-up, market contacts suggested that the morning auctions may also have helped contain year-end pressures. The manager noted that morning SRF auctions may be conducted again in the future. On December 26, a considerable volume of activity had taken place in the noncentrally cleared segment of the repo market, in which the SRF operates, at rates above the SRF rate. The manager stated that, in the future, the Desk may consider possible ways to improve the efficacy of the facility in that market segment. The manager observed that usage of the ON RRP facility increased as expected at year-end but had declined on net over the intermeeting period. The manager also noted that a range of indicators continued to suggest that reserves had remained abundant over the intermeeting period. However, the manager cautioned that the debt limit situation may cloud the signals provided by the indicators. In addition, reserves might decline quickly upon resolution of the debt limit and, at the current pace of balance sheet runoff, might potentially reach levels below those viewed by the Committee as appropriate. Next, the deputy manager briefed policymakers on possible alternative strategies that the Committee might follow with regard to purchases of Treasury securities in the secondary market after the eventual conclusion of the process of balance sheet runoff. These strategies would further implement the policy laid out in the Committee’s Principles and Plans for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve’s Balance Sheet. The briefing outlined a few illustrative scenarios; under each scenario, principal payments received from agency debt and agency mortgage‑backed securities (MBS) holdings would be directed toward Treasury securities via secondary-market purchases. The scenarios presented corresponded to different trajectories of the holdings of Treasury securities in the SOMA. Under all scenarios considered, the maturity composition of Treasury holdings in the SOMA portfolio moved into closer alignment with the maturity composition of the outstanding stock of Treasury securities. The scenarios differed on how quickly this alignment would be achieved and, correspondingly, on the assumed increase over coming years in the share of Treasury bills held in the SOMA portfolio. By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk’s domestic transactions over the intermeeting period. There were no intervention operations in foreign currencies for the System’s account during the intermeeting period. Staff Review of the Economic Situation The information available at the time of the meeting indicated that real gross domestic product (GDP) rose at a solid pace in 2024. After a period of considerable rebalancing, labor market conditions had Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee 7 stabilized, and the unemployment rate remained low. Consumer price inflation remained somewhat elevated. Total consumer price inflation—as measured by the 12-month change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE)—was 2.4 percent in November, down from its year-earlier pace of 2.7 percent. Core PCE price inflation, which excludes changes in consumer energy prices and many consumer food prices, was 2.8 percent in November, down from 3.2 percent a year ago. In December, the 12-month change in the CPI was 2.9 percent and core CPI inflation was 3.2 percent; both were below their year-earlier rates. Based on the CPI and the producer price index, the staff estimated that total PCE price inflation would be reported as 2.6 percent over the 12 months ending in December and that core PCE price inflation would be 2.8 percent. Recent data suggested that labor market conditions remained solid and that the labor market was not especially tight. Average monthly gains for nonfarm payrolls over the fourth quarter were slightly higher than their third-quarter pace. The unemployment rate edged down to 4.1 percent in December, while the labor force participation rate was unchanged and the employment-to-population ratio moved up slightly. The unemployment rates for African Americans and for Hispanics moved down but remained higher than the rates for Asians and for Whites. The ratio of job vacancies to unemployed workers edged up to 1.2 in December, its average over 2019, and the quits rate fell back to 1.9 percent and remained well below its 2019 average. Average hourly earnings for all employees rose 3.9 percent over the 12 months ending in December, down from 4.3 percent a year ago. Available data indicated that real GDP rose at a solid pace in the fourth quarter. Real private domestic final purchases, which comprises PCE and private fixed investment and which often provides a better signal than GDP of underlying economic momentum, appeared to have risen faster than real GDP in the fourth quarter, led by continued strength in consumer spending. By contrast, monthly trade data were volatile but overall pointed to a step-down in both export and import growth relative to the third quarter. The pace of foreign economic activity appeared to have moderated at the end of last year. Indicators suggested that in both the euro area and Mexico, economic growth had slowed notably in the fourth quarter amid lackluster manufacturing activity and subdued private consumption. By contrast, Chinese growth had picked up, in large part because of policy stimulus, and elsewhere in emerging Asia the pace of activity looked to have remained solid, supported by strong global demand for high- tech manufacturing goods. Inflation abroad continued to ease. In most advanced foreign economies (AFEs), headline inflation hovered near target levels, mainly reflecting the rapid pass-through of lower energy prices in the second half of 2024. Even so, services price inflation remained elevated in some of these economies, 8 January 28–29, 2025 such as Germany. In China, inflation remained close to zero, partly reflecting lower food prices. By contrast, in some Latin American countries, most notably Brazil, inflation continued to increase, in part spurred by currency depreciation. Many foreign central banks eased policy during the intermeeting period, including the Bank of Canada, the European Central Bank, and the Swiss National Bank among the AFEs, and the central banks of Colombia, Indonesia, and Mexico among the emerging market economies (EMEs). In contrast, amid improving economic conditions, the Bank of Japan increased its policy rate, taking a further step in gradually removing policy accommodation. Staff Review of the Financial Situation The market-implied path of the federal funds rate over the next year was little changed on net over the intermeeting period. Yields on shorter-term nominal Treasury securities edged down, but longer-term rates rose moderately. The increase in longer-term yields appeared to be partly attributable to higher term premiums. Measures of inflation compensation over the near term moved up, but measures of longer-term inflation compensation remained at levels consistent with inflation returning over time to the Committee’s 2 percent objective. Broad equity price indexes were little changed on net, while measures of the equity risk premium remained low, and corporate bond spreads remained compressed by historical standards. The VIX—a forward-looking measure of near-term equity market volatility—was also roughly unchanged on net and remained at a moderate level by historical standards. Foreign financial market moves over the intermeeting period mainly reflected developments in the U.S., including trade policy news and the relative strength of the U.S. economic data releases during the period. The broad dollar index increased slightly on net. Longer-term AFE yields edged higher, reflecting in part spillovers from higher U.S. yields. Stock price indexes increased in most foreign countries, with the notable exception of China, in which equity prices declined moderately, in part reflecting weaker-than-expected forward-looking manufacturing indicators. Capital outflows from emerging markets continued, and several EME central banks drew down their foreign exchange reserves, including their holdings of U.S. Treasury securities, to resist currency depreciation pressures. Conditions in U.S. short-term funding markets remained generally stable over the intermeeting period, with the lowering of the target range for the federal funds rate in December fully passing through to both secured and unsecured reference rates. Rates in secured markets exhibited temporary, and typical, upward pressure around year-end. Excluding the year-end period, rates in secured markets declined somewhat relative to the effective federal funds rate, likely reflecting the effects of the nearly full pass-through of December’s technical adjustment to the ON RRP offering rate and of declining bill Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee 9 issuance. ON RRP usage increased around year-end but declined slightly on net over the intermeeting period. In domestic credit markets, borrowing costs for households and most businesses remained elevated. Rates on 30-year fixed-rate conforming residential mortgages rose. Interest rates for credit cards and new auto loans declined but remained elevated relative to their historical ranges. Meanwhile, interest rates on commercial and industrial (C&I) loans and small business loans remained elevated. Yields rose for an array of fixed-income securities, including investment-grade corporate bonds and senior commercial MBS tranches, consistent with movements in long-term Treasury yields. Financing through capital markets and nonbank lenders remained broadly available for public corporations and for large and midsize private corporations. With respect to smaller firms, however, credit availability remained relatively tight. Issuance of corporate bonds and leveraged loans moderated toward year-end, likely reflecting seasonal factors. Regarding bank credit, banks in the January Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices (SLOOS) reported leaving their C&I loan standards basically unchanged on net over the fourth quarter.3 Meanwhile, growth in C&I loan balances picked up from modest levels. Banks in the January SLOOS reported tighter lending standards for all commercial real estate (CRE) loan categories. Consistent with tight standards, growth in CRE loans on banks’ books remained subdued in the fourth quarter. Credit remained available for most households, though standards appear to have tightened somewhat for lower-credit-score borrowers. Growth in credit card loan balances at banks picked up in the fourth quarter, but issuance of new credit cards to nonprime borrowers continued to decline. In the residential mortgage market, credit remained easily available for high-credit-score borrowers but tightened slightly in November and December for lower-score borrowers. In the January SLOOS, respondents on net indicated that standards tightened for credit cards, eased for auto loans, and were about unchanged for most residential mortgages. Credit quality remained solid for large and midsize firms, most home mortgage borrowers, and municipalities but continued to deteriorate in other sectors. The credit performance of corporate bonds and leveraged loans showed some signs of deterioration but remained generally stable. Delinquency rates on loans to small businesses ticked down but remained elevated. Credit quality in the CRE market deteriorated further, driven largely by office and multifamily loans. Regarding household credit quality, the delinquency rate on Federal Housing Administration mortgages edged up in November and remained elevated relative to the past few years. In contrast, delinquency rates on 3 The SLOOS results reported are based on banks’ responses, weighted by each bank’s outstanding loans in the respective loan category, and might therefore differ from the results reported in the published SLOOS, which are based on banks’ unweighted responses. 10 January 28–29, 2025 most other mortgage loan types remained low. Delinquency rates for credit cards increased a bit further in the third quarter, while those for auto loans stayed about flat. The staff provided an update on its assessment of the stability of the U.S. financial system and, on balance, continued to characterize the system’s financial vulnerabilities as notable. The staff judged that asset valuation pressures were elevated. In contrast to valuations in equity, corporate debt, and residential real estate markets, CRE property prices have declined notably in recent years, though price indexes were about flat in the third quarter. Vulnerabilities associated with business and household debt were characterized as moderate. Nonfinancial business leverage was elevated by historical standards, but the ability of publicly traded firms to service their debt remained strong, supported by robust earnings and the low interest rates that firms continued to enjoy on the portion of fixed-rate debt issued early in the pandemic. That said, the fraction of private firm debt having very low interest coverage ratios continued to increase, pointing to further deterioration in the balance sheets of riskier firms. Household balance sheets remained solid overall, as aggregate home equity remained high and delinquencies on mortgage loans continued to be low. Vulnerabilities associated with leverage in the financial sector were characterized as notable. Regulatory capital ratios in the banking sector remained high; however, banks continued to hold large quantities of long-duration assets, leaving them more exposed than usual to an unexpected rise in longer-term interest rates. In the nonbank sector, leverage at hedge funds remained high. Vulnerabilities associated with funding risks were characterized as moderate. Large nonglobal systemically important banks and regional banks reduced their reliance on uninsured deposits notably since the end of 2021. Though assets in prime money market funds had been growing recently, their size relative to GDP remained well below levels seen before 2016. Staff Economic Outlook The staff projection for economic activity was similar to the one prepared for the December meeting, with the output gap expected to narrow further until early next year and to remain roughly flat thereafter, and with the unemployment rate expected to remain close to the staff’s estimate of its natural rate. For this projection, the staff had used the same preliminary placeholder assumptions for potential policy changes that were used for the previous baseline forecast, and continued to note elevated uncertainty regarding the scope, timing, and potential economic effects of possible changes to trade, immigration, fiscal, and regulatory policies. The staff highlighted the difficulty of assessing the importance of such factors for the baseline projection and had prepared a number of alternative scenarios. Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee 11 The staff’s inflation projection was also essentially unchanged from the one prepared for the previous meeting. Inflation in 2025 was expected to be similar to 2024’s rate, as the effects of the staff’s placeholder assumption for trade policy put upward pressure on inflation this year. After that, inflation was projected to decline to 2 percent by 2027. The staff continued to view the uncertainty around the baseline projection as similar to the average over the past 20 years, a period that saw a number of episodes during which uncertainty about the economy and federal policy changes was elevated. The staff judged that the risks around the baseline projections for economic activity and employment were roughly balanced. The risks around the baseline projection for inflation were seen as skewed to the upside because core inflation had not come down as much as expected in 2024 and because changes to trade policy could put more upward pressure on inflation than the staff had assumed. Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook In their discussion of inflation developments, participants observed that inflation had eased significantly over the past two years. Inflation remained somewhat elevated, however, relative to the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run goal, and progress toward that goal had slowed over the past year. Available data suggested that total PCE prices had risen about 2.6 percent over the 12 months ending in December and that, excluding the volatile consumer food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 2.8 percent. A number of participants remarked that current readings of 12-month inflation were boosted by relatively high inflation readings in the first quarter of last year, and several participants noted that cumulative inflation over the past 3, 6, or 9 months showed greater progress than 12-month measures. Most participants commented that month-over-month inflation readings in November and December had exhibited notable progress toward the Committee’s goal of price stability, including in some key subcategories. Many participants, however, emphasized that additional evidence of continued disinflation would be needed to support the view that inflation was returning sustainably to 2 percent. Regarding the subcategories, housing services inflation, which had remained elevated for much of the previous year, had shown a decline, as had market-based measures of core nonhousing services inflation. Several participants noted that some nonmarket- based services price categories, such as financial and insurance services, had shown less improvement, but a few also observed that price movements in such categories typically have not provided reliable signals about resource pressures or the future trajectory of inflation. Several participants observed that core goods prices had not declined as much on net in recent months compared with earlier in 2024. With regard to the outlook for inflation, participants expected that, under appropriate monetary policy, inflation would continue to move toward 2 percent, although progress could remain uneven. 12 January 28–29, 2025 Participants cited various factors as likely to put continuing downward pressure on inflation, including an easing in nominal wage growth, well-anchored longer-term inflation expectations, waning business pricing power, and the Committee’s still-restrictive monetary policy stance. A few noted, however, that the current target range for the federal funds rate may not be far above its neutral level. Furthermore, some participants commented that with supply and demand in the labor market roughly in balance and in light of recent productivity gains, labor market conditions were unlikely to be a source of inflationary pressure in the near future. However, other factors were cited as having the potential to hinder the disinflation process, including the effects of potential changes in trade and immigration policy as well as strong consumer demand. Business contacts in a number of Districts had indicated that firms would attempt to pass on to consumers higher input costs arising from potential tariffs. In addition, some participants noted that some market- or survey-based measures of expected inflation had increased recently, although many participants emphasized that longer-term measures of expected inflation had remained well anchored. Some participants remarked that reported inflation at the beginning of the year was harder than usual to interpret because of the difficulties in fully removing seasonal effects, and a couple of participants commented that any increase in reported inflation in the first quarter due to such difficulties would imply a corresponding decrease in reported inflation in other quarters of the year. Participants judged that labor market conditions had remained solid and that those conditions were broadly consistent with the Committee’s goal of maximum employment. Payroll gains had averaged 170,000 per month over the last three months of 2024 and the unemployment rate had stabilized at a relatively low level. Participants also noted that recent readings of indicators such as job vacancies, the quits rate, and labor turnover were generally consistent with stable labor market conditions. Participants anticipated that under appropriate monetary policy, conditions in the labor market would likely remain solid. Nonetheless, participants generally noted that labor market indicators merited close monitoring. Business contacts in a few Districts noted that they were expecting stable employment levels and moderate wage growth at their firms. A couple of participants noted that the upcoming benchmark revision to the payroll growth estimates by the Bureau of Labor Statistics could provide more clarity regarding labor market conditions. Participants observed that the economy had continued to expand at a solid pace and that recent data on economic activity, and consumer spending in particular were, on balance, stronger than anticipated. Participants remarked that consumption had been supported by a solid labor market, elevated household net worth, and rising real wages, which had been associated in part with productivity gains. Several participants cautioned that low- and moderate-income households continued to experience financial strains, which could damp their spending. A few participants cited Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee 13 continued increases in rates of delinquencies on credit card borrowing and automobile loans as signs of such strains. With regard to the business sector, participants observed that investment in equipment and intangibles was strong over the past year, though it appeared to have slowed in the fourth quarter. Some participants noted that favorable aggregate supply developments—including increases in labor supply, business investment, and productivity—continued to support a solid expansion of business activity. Many participants remarked that District contacts or surveys of businesses reported substantial optimism about the economic outlook, stemming in part from an expectation of an easing in government regulations or changes in tax policies. In contrast, some participants noted that contacts reported increased uncertainty regarding potential changes in federal government policies. A couple of participants remarked that the agricultural sector continued to face significant strains stemming from low crop prices and high input costs. A number of participants commented on the financial conditions bearing on spending by households and businesses. Participants generally saw it as important to continue to keep a close watch on such conditions and their potential effects on economic activity and inflation. Many participants noted that certain financial conditions had tightened over the past several months. For example, longer-term Treasury and corporate bond yields and mortgage rates had risen notably. A couple of participants commented that high equity valuations or low credit spreads were providing some support to economic activity. In their evaluation of the risks and uncertainties associated with the economic outlook, the vast majority of participants judged that the risks to the achievement of the Committee’s dual-mandate objectives of maximum employment and price stability were roughly in balance, though a couple commented that the risks to achieving the price stability mandate currently appeared to be greater than the risks to achieving the maximum employment mandate. Participants generally pointed to upside risks to the inflation outlook. In particular, participants cited the possible effects of potential changes in trade and immigration policy, the potential for geopolitical developments to disrupt supply chains, or stronger-than-expected household spending. A couple of participants remarked that, in the period ahead, it might be especially difficult to distinguish between relatively persistent changes in inflation and more temporary changes that might be associated with the introduction of new government policies. Participants pointed to various risks to economic activity and employment, including downside risks associated with an unexpected weakening of the labor market, a weakening of consumers’ financial positions, or a tightening of financial conditions, as well as upside risks associated with a potentially more favorable regulatory environment for businesses and continued strength in domestic spending. 14 January 28–29, 2025 In their discussion of financial stability, participants who commented noted a range of factors that warranted monitoring. Several participants mentioned issues related to the banking system. A few commented that bank funding risks had lessened and that many banks had improved their ability to access the discount window; however, a couple observed that some banks had increased their reliance on reciprocal deposits, and that the stability of these deposits had not been tested in a time of stress. Several participants noted that some banks remained vulnerable to a rise in longer-term yields and the associated unrealized losses on bank assets. Several participants also mentioned potential vulnerabilities at nonbank financial institutions or nonfinancial corporations to a rise in longer-term yields or to leverage in these sectors. A few participants noted concerns about asset valuation pressures in equity and corporate debt markets. A few participants discussed vulnerabilities associated with CRE exposures, noting that risks remained, although there were some signs that the deterioration of conditions in the CRE sector was lessening. Several participants commented on cyber risks that could impair the operation of financial institutions, financial infrastructure, and, potentially, the overall economy. Several participants commented on vulnerabilities in the Treasury market, including concerns about dealer intermediation capacity and the degree of leveraged positions in the market. The migration to central clearing was noted by a few as an important development to track in this regard. In their consideration of monetary policy at this meeting, participants noted that inflation remained somewhat elevated. Participants also observed that recent indicators suggested that economic activity had continued to expand at a solid pace, that the unemployment rate had stabilized at a low level, and that labor market conditions had remained solid in recent months. With the stance of policy significantly less restrictive than it had been before the Committee’s policy easing over its previous three meetings, all participants viewed it as appropriate to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 4¼ to 4½ percent. Participants judged that it was appropriate to continue the process of reducing the Federal Reserve’s securities holdings. In discussing the outlook for monetary policy, participants observed that the Committee was well positioned to take time to assess the evolving outlook for economic activity, the labor market, and inflation, with the vast majority pointing to a still-restrictive policy stance. Participants indicated that, provided the economy remained near maximum employment, they would want to see further progress on inflation before making additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate. Participants noted that policy decisions were not on a preset course and were conditional on the evolution of the economy, the economic outlook, and the balance of risks. In discussing risk-management considerations that could bear on the outlook for monetary policy, a majority of participants observed that the current high degree of uncertainty made it appropriate for the Committee to take a careful approach in considering additional adjustments to the stance of Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee 15 monetary policy. Factors mentioned by participants as supporting such an approach included the reduced downside risks to the outlook for the labor market and economic activity, increased upside risks to the outlook for inflation, and uncertainties concerning the neutral rate of interest, the degree of restraint from higher longer-term interest rates, or the economic effects of potential government policies. Many participants noted that the Committee could hold the policy rate at a restrictive level if the economy remained strong and inflation remained elevated, while several remarked that policy could be eased if labor market conditions deteriorated, economic activity faltered, or inflation returned to 2 percent more quickly than anticipated. A number of participants also discussed some issues related to the balance sheet. Regarding the composition of secondary-market purchases of Treasury securities that would occur once the process of reducing the size of the Federal Reserve’s holdings of securities had come to an end, many participants expressed the view that it would be appropriate to structure purchases in a way that moved the maturity composition of the SOMA portfolio closer to that of the outstanding stock of Treasury debt while also minimizing the risk of disruptions to the market. Regarding the potential for significant swings in reserves over coming months related to debt ceiling dynamics, various participants noted that it may be appropriate to consider pausing or slowing balance sheet runoff until the resolution of this event. Several participants also expressed support for the Desk’s future consideration of possible ways to improve the efficacy of the SRF. Committee Policy Actions In their discussions of monetary policy for this meeting, members agreed that recent indicators suggested that economic activity had continued to expand at a solid pace. The unemployment rate had stabilized at a low level in recent months and labor market conditions had remained solid. Members concurred that inflation remained somewhat elevated. Almost all members agreed that the risks to achieving the Committee’s employment and inflation goals were roughly in balance. Members viewed the economic outlook as uncertain and agreed that they were attentive to the risks to both sides of the Committee’s dual mandate. In support of its goals, the Committee agreed to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 4¼ to 4½ percent. Members agreed that in considering the extent and timing of additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee would carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. Members agreed to continue to reduce the Federal Reserve’s holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency MBS. All members agreed that the postmeeting statement should affirm their strong commitment both to supporting maximum employment and to returning inflation to the Committee’s 2 percent objective. 16 January 28–29, 2025 Members agreed that in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee would continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. They would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerged that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals. Members also agreed that their assessments would take into account a wide range of information, including readings on labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the following domestic policy directive, for release at 2:00 p.m.: “Effective January 30, 2025, the Federal Open Market Committee directs the Desk to: • Undertake open market operations as necessary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of 4¼ to 4½ percent. • Conduct standing overnight repurchase agreement operations with a minimum bid rate of 4.5 percent and with an aggregate operation limit of $500 billion. • Conduct standing overnight reverse repurchase agreement operations at an offering rate of 4.25 percent and with a per‑counterparty limit of $160 billion per day. • Roll over at auction the amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of Treasury securities maturing in each calendar month that exceeds a cap of $25 billion per month. Redeem Treasury coupon securities up to this monthly cap and Treasury bills to the extent that coupon principal payments are less than the monthly cap. • Reinvest the amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage‑backed securities (MBS) received in each calendar month that exceeds a cap of $35 billion per month into Treasury securities to roughly match the maturity composition of Treasury securities outstanding. • Allow modest deviations from stated amounts for reinvestments, if needed for operational reasons. • Engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal Reserve’s agency MBS transactions.” The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below for release at 2:00 p.m.: Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee 17 “Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace. The unemployment rate has stabilized at a low level in recent months, and labor market conditions remain solid. Inflation remains somewhat elevated. The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. The Committee judges that the risks to achieving its employment and inflation goals are roughly in balance. The economic outlook is uncertain, and the Committee is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate. In support of its goals, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 4¼ to 4½ percent. In considering the extent and timing of additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. The Committee will continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage‑backed securities. The Committee is strongly committed to supporting maximum employment and returning inflation to its 2 percent objective. In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals. The Committee’s assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.” Voting for this action: Jerome H.

{"date": "2025-03-19", "year": 2025, "source_type": "FOMC Minutes", "url": "https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20250319.pdf", "text": "FOMC FEDERAL RESERV E SYSTEM Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee March 18–19, 2025 Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee March 18–19, 2025 A joint meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System was held in the offices of the Board of Governors on Tuesday, March 18, 2025, at 9:00 a.m. and continued on Wednesday, March 19, 2025, at 9:00 a.m.1 Review of Monetary Policy Strategy, Tools, and Communications Committee participants continued their discussions related to their review of the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy framework, with a focus on labor market dynamics and the FOMC’s maximum employment goal. The staff briefed policymakers on the concept of maximum employment and related labor market indicators. They discussed conceptual benchmarks used in evaluating the position of the labor market relative to maximum employment and in ascertaining the interaction of maximum employment and price stability. They discussed a set of core labor market indicators used to help assess maximum employment, including the unemployment rate, job vacancies, the employment-to-population (EPOP) ratio, and the labor force participation rate (LFPR), and described the use of these indicators in assessing maximum employment during the pandemic-related recession and subsequent economic recovery. The staff also presented model-based analysis of simple monetary policy rules that respond to deviations of inflation from 2 percent but differ on whether they respond to shortfalls or deviations from maximum employment. Participants generally supported the current description of maximum employment in the Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy as being not directly measurable and changing over time for reasons owing largely to nonmonetary factors. Participants acknowledged that it is difficult to assess maximum employment and that they have been well served by monitoring a wide range of indicators that can vary depending on labor market and economic conditions. They also reflected on how both the Committee and the public have interpreted the current description of maximum employment as a broad-based and inclusive goal. Participants reviewed the relationship between the dual-mandate goals and noted that those goals are not necessarily in conflict when both unemployment and inflation are low. Participants also discussed 1 The Federal Open Market Committee is referenced as the “FOMC” and the “Committee” in these minutes; the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System is referenced as the “Board” in these minutes. 2 March 18–19, 2025 the implications of pursuing a strategy that seeks to mitigate shortfalls of employment from its maximum level, as described in the statement, and the ways the public has interpreted that approach since it was introduced into the statement. Participants indicated that they thought it would be appropriate to reconsider the shortfalls language. They judged that any strategy conveyed in the statement should be robust to a wide range of economic circumstances. They also considered the extent to which the current statement had effectively communicated the Committee’s approach to achieving its longer-run goals, including the Committee’s assessment of the appropriate policy responses in a period of a tight labor market. Developments in Financial Markets and Open Market Operations The manager turned first to a review of financial market developments. Over the intermeeting period, Treasury yields declined, equity prices fell, credit spreads widened, and the dollar depreciated. These moves appeared to reflect increased perceived risks—rather than a base case—of a significant deterioration of the U.S. outlook, as investors responded to both weaker-than-expected consumer spending and sentiment data as well as to developments in trade policy that had raised uncertainty. The manager observed that the implied average federal funds rate path from futures had shifted noticeably lower over the intermeeting period for horizons beyond the middle of this year. By contrast, the implied modal federal funds rate path from options was little changed, consistent with the interpretation that the baseline outlook had not changed materially. The Open Market Desk’s Survey of Market Expectations told a similar story, as the median respondent’s modal path for the federal funds rate in 2025 was little changed. The expected timing of rate cuts in 2026 and 2027 was brought forward about a quarter, but the expected terminal rate was unchanged. Survey respondents, however, attached noticeably higher probabilities to both lower gross domestic product (GDP) growth outcomes and higher inflation outcomes for 2025 compared with the January survey, consistent with a higher perceived risk of a negative supply shock this year. Nominal Treasury yields declined about 25 basis points, on net, over the period, led by decreases in real yields that reflected lower expected real rates and lower real term premiums. Near-term measures of inflation compensation rose amid trade-related developments, while at horizons beyond a year, forward measures of inflation compensation fell. Overall, both market- and survey-based measures suggested that inflation expectations remained well anchored. U.S. equity prices decreased notably, on net, over the intermeeting period, with particularly pronounced declines in the technology and cyclical sectors. While trade-related news had been the most prominent driver of equity price movements, the manager also noted that risk-management considerations may have led some levered investors to reduce long equity positions that were generating increasing losses, amplifying price movements. Option-implied volatility of broad equity Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee 3 prices increased over the intermeeting period to a level somewhat above its long-run average, and credit spreads widened, albeit to levels below historical averages. Asset price dynamics abroad were opposite to those in the U.S. Major foreign equity indexes, including those of the euro area and China, appreciated notably over the intermeeting period, while sovereign yields increased in many jurisdictions. The dollar depreciated against most major currencies, although currencies perceived as more sensitive to higher U.S. tariff rates, such as the Canadian dollar and those in emerging Asia, were relatively little changed. Overall, market participants characterized price action across global equities, global rates, and foreign exchange (FX) as consistent with some re-allocation away from trades that had been based on expectations for continued U.S. economic outperformance relative to global peers. The manager turned next to money market developments. Unsecured overnight rates remained stable over the intermeeting period, while rates in the repurchase agreement (repo) market varied notably, and some indicators suggested that conditions in that market had continued to tighten. The pass- through to repo rates of the 5 basis point technical adjustment to the overnight reverse repurchase agreement (ON RRP) rate made in December appeared to have dissipated in February, even though repo rates had declined in mid-March as a result of a drop in bill issuance associated with the debt limit situation. Furthermore, the sensitivity of repo rates in the client-to-dealer segment to changes in transaction volumes had diminished relative to the spike observed at year-end but remained at levels above those that prevailed in late 2024. The sensitivity of repo rates to Treasury bill issuance had also increased in recent months. The manager interpreted these developments more as signs of continued normalization of the repo market than as a concern, but he also noted that, in the past, a tightening of the repo market had been a precursor to tighter reserve conditions. The manager observed that the ON RRP facility had reached a post-2021 low of under $59 billion in mid-February. Abstracting from the debt limit situation, with the ON RRP facility nearly depleted, portfolio runoff was likely to translate to lower reserves in the future. Several indicators of reserve conditions continued to point to reserves remaining abundant, but the reliability of the signals provided by those indicators was starting to be impaired by the debt limit situation, which was already affecting the Federal Reserve’s liabilities. The Treasury General Account (TGA) had declined nearly $300 billion since the debt issuance suspension period was declared in January. As a result, reserves were about $180 billion higher; ON RRP balances had also increased somewhat. Reserves were likely to continue to grow, except for periods around tax dates, until a resolution of the debt limit situation and then drop quickly as the TGA is rebuilt. In that scenario, reserves could potentially reach levels below those viewed by the Committee as appropriate without market indicators being able to provide much advance warning. The manager noted that either pausing or sufficiently slowing runoff would provide meaningful insurance against that possibility. 4 March 18–19, 2025 More generally, the manager also noted that slowing runoff would also be an effective way—consistent with the Committee’s plans—of addressing the risks posed by a continued tightening of repo market conditions and a nearly depleted ON RRP facility. Desk survey results indicated that more than half of the respondents expected the Committee to either pause or slow runoff as its next move, with a majority of those leaning toward a slowdown. Many respondents also expected the System Open Market Account (SOMA) portfolio to consist, in the long run, of Treasury securities only and to match the maturity composition of Treasury debt outstanding. By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk’s domestic transactions over the intermeeting period. There were no intervention operations in foreign currencies for the System’s account during the intermeeting period. Staff Review of the Economic Situation The information available at the time of the meeting indicated that real GDP was expanding at a solid pace. The unemployment rate had stabilized at a relatively low level since the middle of last year. Consumer price inflation remained somewhat elevated. Total consumer price inflation—as measured by the 12-month change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE)—was estimated by the staff to have been 2.5 percent in February, based on the consumer and producer price indexes. Core PCE price inflation, which excludes changes in consumer energy prices and many consumer food prices, was estimated to have been 2.8 percent in February. Both total and core inflation were little changed relative to their year-earlier levels. Recent data indicated that labor market conditions remained solid and had stabilized. The unemployment rate was 4.1 percent in February, the same as in December. The EPOP ratio and the LFPR edged down, on balance, over January and February. Average monthly gains for total nonfarm payrolls over January and February were solid but somewhat lower than their pace in the second half of last year. The ratio of job vacancies to unemployed workers was 1.1 in February, a bit below its average over 2019, and the quits rate edged up to 2.1 percent in January but was still well below its 2019 average. The total employment cost index for private-sector workers rose 3.6 percent over the 12 months ending in December, well below its year-earlier level. Average hourly earnings for all employees rose 4.0 percent over the 12 months ending in February, little changed from a year ago. Real GDP growth was estimated to have been 2.3 percent in the fourth quarter, and available data suggested that real GDP was still rising at a solid, though somewhat slower, pace in the first quarter. Real PCE declined in January, but retail sales and sales of light motor vehicles bounced back in February. In contrast to most of the data in hand used to estimate real GDP growth, many indicators of consumer and business sentiment had turned more downbeat over the past two months. Export Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee 5 growth was modest in January. Import growth was strong relative to its fourth-quarter pace, consistent with reports that some U.S. importers were stocking up ahead of prospective tariff increases. Economic growth abroad slowed to a subdued pace in the fourth quarter, in part because of weak manufacturing activity in Europe and Mexico. Recent export data from abroad and some other indicators suggested that foreign economic growth recovered modestly at the start of this year. Other indicators, however, pointed to weak momentum in manufacturing production, especially in Canada and Mexico. In China, the authorities announced a target of around 5 percent for GDP growth in 2025, supported by new fiscal policy measures. Inflation abroad continued to remain near central bank targets in most foreign economies. In advanced foreign economies (AFEs), total inflation ticked up, in part because of a short-lived spike in oil prices early in the year, but core inflation continued to cool as wage growth slowed. In China, January and February inflation data suggested continued weak underlying price pressures. By contrast, in some Latin American countries, most notably Brazil, inflation picked up further, in part driven by past currency depreciation. Many foreign central banks eased policy during the intermeeting period, including the Bank of Canada, the Bank of England, and the European Central Bank in the AFEs, and the Bank of Korea and the Bank of Mexico in the emerging market economies. By contrast, the Central Bank of Brazil increased its policy rate amid continued inflation concerns. Foreign central banks were increasingly noting that elevated uncertainty about trade policies was clouding their economic outlooks. Staff Review of the Financial Situation Over the intermeeting period, the market-implied path of the federal funds rate over the next few meetings edged higher but moved down at horizons beyond September, as ongoing trade policy uncertainty, indicators of weakening consumer and business sentiment, and some softer-than- expected economic data releases prompted investors to become more concerned about higher near- term inflation and downside risks to economic growth. Near-term inflation compensation rose notably, although longer-term inflation compensation appeared to remain well anchored. Nominal and real Treasury yields fell notably across the maturity spectrum. Broad equity price indexes declined notably on net. The VIX—a forward-looking measure of near-term equity market volatility—rose, on net, following disappointing economic data releases and a number of tariff-related developments, and ended the period somewhat above its median over the past few decades. Credit spreads on investment- and speculative-grade bonds widened, on net, consistent with emerging concerns about economic growth, although both spreads remained narrow by historical standards. 6 March 18–19, 2025 Foreign financial markets were affected by investor concerns about global economic growth, in part related to higher tariffs, while expectations for greater fiscal spending in some economies provided an offsetting effect. On balance, longer-term yields and equity indexes increased in most major foreign economies. Tariff-related developments led to significant volatility in FX markets, and the exchange value of the dollar declined, on net, as investor optimism regarding the relative strength of the U.S. economy seemed to have diminished. Conditions in U.S. short-term funding markets remained orderly. Secured market rates increased early in the period, retracing the decline following the technical adjustment in the ON RRP rate in December, before declining later in the period. Treasury bill supply began contracting in late February and was expected to decline further until the resolution of the federal debt limit situation. The accompanying drawdown in the TGA was expected to boost ON RRP take-up and reserves, putting downward pressure on secured market rates; early signs of these dynamics were evident over the latter half of the period. Borrowing costs for households, businesses, and municipalities declined. Rates on 30-year fixed-rate conforming residential mortgages declined in line with the 10-year Treasury yield. Interest rates for newly originated commercial and industrial (C&I) loans moved down a bit in the fourth quarter but remained elevated relative to their historical distribution. Yields on newly issued agency and non- agency commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) decreased but stayed somewhat above historical standards. While interest rates on existing credit card accounts remained elevated, they fell noticeably in the fourth quarter, reflecting the declines in the prime rate since the September FOMC meeting. Auto loan rates also fell last quarter but retraced some of those declines early this year. Financing from capital markets continued to be broadly available for large-to-midsize businesses and municipalities. Following subdued corporate bond issuance in December, gross issuance was solid in January and February. Bank credit appeared to have become somewhat more available to large businesses. C&I loan balances at large domestic banks continued to grow modestly through mid- February. By contrast, credit conditions for small businesses remained moderately tight. Multiple recent surveys, including the Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices and the Kansas City Fed’s Small Business Lending Survey, suggested that lending standards had remained relatively tight for small businesses through December. Commercial real estate (CRE) loan growth accelerated through mid-February after remaining subdued in the second half of last year, as growth in nonfarm nonresidential loans was strong. Credit continued to be easily available for high-credit-score mortgage borrowers. Mortgage credit availability for lower-credit-score borrowers continued to tighten slightly. Consumer credit remained generally available. Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee 7 Credit quality remained solid for large-to-midsize firms, municipalities, and most home mortgage borrowers, but it continued to deteriorate in other sectors. The credit performance of corporate bonds had been generally stable recently, and the performance of leveraged loans deteriorated slightly but remained solid overall. At banks, delinquency rates on C&I loans edged up in the fourth quarter but stayed just above the middle of the range observed over the past decade. Meanwhile, delinquency rates for short- and long-term small business loans and for small business credit cards ticked down in December but remained above pre-pandemic levels. Credit quality in the CRE market deteriorated in the fourth quarter, partly driven by multifamily loans. More recently, however, CMBS delinquency rates declined in January and February, particularly among office building loans. The short-term delinquency rate on Federal Housing Administration mortgages inched down in January but remained elevated relative to the past few years. Delinquency rates on most other types of home mortgages stayed low. Delinquency rates on credit cards fell substantially in the fourth quarter, their largest decline since the second quarter of 2021, but they remained at elevated levels. Staff Economic Outlook The staff projection for real GDP growth was weaker than the one prepared for the January meeting, as incoming data for aggregate spending were below expectations and the support from financial conditions had lessened. The unemployment rate was forecast to edge up but remain close to the staff’s estimate of its natural rate. The staff made no material changes to the placeholder assumptions for potential policies that were used for the previous baseline forecast and continued to note elevated uncertainty regarding the scope, timing, and potential economic effects of possible changes to trade, immigration, fiscal, and regulatory policies. The staff continued to highlight the difficulty of assessing the importance of such factors for the baseline projection and had prepared a number of alternative scenarios. The staff’s inflation projection was a little higher for this year than the one prepared for the previous meeting, primarily reflecting higher-than-expected incoming data. Inflation in 2025 was forecast to be somewhat above the rate posted last year, mostly because the expected effects of the staff’s placeholder assumption for trade policy put upward pressure on inflation this year. After that, inflation was projected to decline to 2 percent by 2027. The staff assessed that the uncertainty around their baseline projection had increased but continued to view the uncertainty around the forecast as similar to the average over the past 20 years, a period that saw a number of episodes during which uncertainty about the economy and federal policy changes was elevated. The staff judged that the risks around the baseline projections for economic activity and employment had tilted to the downside, as data on aggregate spending and financial conditions had come in somewhat weaker than expected and a number of indicators of household, 8 March 18–19, 2025 business, and financial market participant sentiment had turned downbeat. The risks around the baseline projection for inflation were still seen as skewed to the upside because core inflation had not come down as much as expected last year and because changes to trade policy could put more upward pressure on inflation than the staff had assumed. Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, participants submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation for each year from 2025 through 2027 and over the longer run. The projections were based on participants’ individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy, including their projections of the federal funds rate. The longer-run projections represented each participant’s assessment of the rate to which each variable would tend to converge under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy. Participants also provided their individual assessments of the level of uncertainty and the balance of risks associated with their projections. The Summary of Economic Projections was released to the public after the meeting. Participants observed that available data pointed to an economy that continued to grow at a solid pace and labor market conditions that remained broadly balanced, but that inflation stayed somewhat elevated. Participants generally noted the high degree of uncertainty facing the economy. Information from participants’ business contacts and from many surveys indicated some deterioration in household and business sentiment amid heightened uncertainty about government policies. Various participants commented that high uncertainty had the potential to damp consumer spending as well as business hiring and investment activities or that inflation was likely to be boosted by increased tariffs. As a result, participants generally saw increased downside risks to employment and economic growth and upside risks to inflation while indicating that high uncertainty surrounded their economic outlooks. In their discussion of inflation developments, participants noted that inflation had eased significantly over the past two years but remained somewhat elevated relative to the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run goal. Some participants observed that inflation data over the first two months of this year were higher than they had expected. Among the major subcategories of prices, housing services inflation had continued to moderate, consistent with the past slowing in market rents, but inflation in core nonhousing services remained high, especially in nonmarket services. Some participants highlighted that core goods inflation had increased, and most of them noted that these increases might reflect the effects of the anticipation of higher tariffs. With regard to the outlook for inflation, participants judged that inflation was likely to be boosted this year by the effects of higher tariffs, although significant uncertainty surrounded the magnitude and Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee 9 persistence of such effects. Several participants noted that the announced or planned tariff increases were larger and broader than many of their business contacts had expected. Several participants also noted that their contacts were already reporting increases in costs, possibly in anticipation of rising tariffs, or that their contacts had indicated willingness to pass on to consumers higher input costs that would arise from potential tariff increases. A couple of participants highlighted factors that might limit the inflationary effects of tariffs, noting that many households had depleted the excess savings they had accumulated during the pandemic and were less likely to accept additional price increases, or that stricter immigration policies might reduce demand for rental and affordable housing and alleviate upward pressures on housing inflation. A couple of participants noted that the continued balance in the labor market suggested that labor market conditions were unlikely to be a source of inflationary pressure. A couple of participants noted that, in the period ahead, it could be especially difficult to distinguish between relatively persistent changes in inflation and more temporary changes that might be associated with the introduction of tariffs. Participants commented on a range of factors that could influence the persistence of tariff effects, including the extent to which tariffs are imposed on intermediate goods and thus affect input costs at various stages of production, the extent to which complex supply chains need to be restructured, the actions of trading partners in responding with retaliatory increases in tariffs, and the stability of longer-term inflation expectations. Almost all participants pointed out that many market- or survey-based measures of near-term expected inflation had increased recently. Participants generally noted that most measures of longer- term expected inflation remained well anchored, a factor likely to put downward pressure on inflation. Several participants emphasized that ensuring that longer-term inflation expectations remained anchored would enhance the Committee’s ability to achieve its price-stability goal. Participants judged that labor market conditions remained broadly in balance. The unemployment rate had stabilized at a relatively low level, and nominal wage growth continued to moderate. Average payroll employment growth, while slowing some recently, remained solid. Several participants highlighted recent increases in businesses’ layoff announcements and in people working part time for economic reasons. A majority of participants commented that the recent cuts in federal government jobs and to federal funding had begun to affect employment at federal contractors, universities, hospitals, municipalities, and nonprofit organizations, with many organizations that rely on government contracts having reported layoffs or pauses in their hiring plans. In addition, many participants noted that their contacts and business survey respondents reported pausing hiring decisions because of elevated policy uncertainty. Several participants relayed reports from contacts who were concerned that restrictive immigration policies would reduce labor supply and put upward pressure on wages in certain sectors. 10 March 18–19, 2025 Participants observed that the available data suggested that the economy had continued to grow at a solid pace but that there were some indications that consumer spending growth might be moderating from its rapid pace over the previous two quarters. Several participants commented that the mixed retail sales data in January and February were consistent with consumption continuing to grow at a positive yet slower pace. Several participants noted that the recent downgrade in earnings forecasts from retailers and airline companies pointed to weaker consumer demand from both lower- and higher-income households. Participants commented on a number of factors that could restrain consumption, including weaker consumer sentiment and deteriorations in expected household financial situations, as indicated by a number of household surveys, and anticipation that the robust labor income growth and significant increases in asset prices over the previous several years might not continue. By contrast, a few participants noted that consumption spending could continue to be supported by solid growth in real personal disposable income or by a rebound in equity prices. With regard to the business sector, most participants commented that contacts or surveys reported increased uncertainty about potential changes in federal government policies and a deterioration in business sentiment, which had led many firms to pause their capital spending plans. Several participants highlighted that the auto industry faced significant risks associated with tariffs because of its interconnected and cross-border supply chains. By contrast, several participants noted that their contacts expressed optimism about future firm profitability driven by more business-friendly regulatory or fiscal policy changes or expected productivity gains from artificial intelligence and related technologies. A few participants highlighted the strains faced by the agricultural sector, as tariffs threatened to further compress its profit margins by lowering farm export prices and raising input costs. Some participants noted that financial conditions had tightened since the January meeting, reflecting lower equity prices and higher risk spreads on corporate bonds, but most of them commented that risk premiums in bond and equity markets remained low by historical standards or that businesses and consumers with higher credit scores continued to be able to obtain financing. A few participants cautioned that an abrupt repricing of risk in financial markets could exacerbate the effects of any negative shocks to the economy. In their consideration of monetary policy at this meeting, participants noted that inflation remained somewhat elevated. Participants also observed that recent indicators suggested that economic activity had continued to expand at a solid pace, that the unemployment rate had stabilized at a low level, and that labor market conditions had remained solid in recent months. In this context, and amid elevated uncertainty around the economic outlook, all participants viewed it as appropriate to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 4¼ to 4½ percent. Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee 11 In discussing the outlook for monetary policy, participants remarked that uncertainty about the net effect of an array of government policies on the economic outlook was high, making it appropriate to take a cautious approach. Emphasizing that uncertainty, a majority of participants noted the potential for inflationary effects arising from various factors to be more persistent than they projected. With economic growth and the labor market still solid and current monetary policy restrictive, participants assessed that the Committee was well positioned to wait for more clarity on the outlook for inflation and economic activity. Participants noted that policy decisions were not on a preset course and would be informed by the evolution of the economy, the economic outlook, and the balance of risks. In discussing risk-management considerations that could bear on the outlook for monetary policy, participants assessed that uncertainty around the economic outlook had increased, with almost all participants viewing risks to inflation as tilted to the upside and risks to employment as tilted to the downside. Participants remarked that monetary policy was well positioned to address future developments; a restrictive policy could be maintained for longer if inflation were to remain elevated, and policy could be eased if labor market conditions were to deteriorate or economic activity were to weaken. Some participants observed, however, that the Committee may face difficult tradeoffs if inflation proved to be more persistent while the outlook for growth and employment weakened. Several participants emphasized that elevated inflation could prove to be more persistent than expected. Participants assessed that balance sheet reduction had gone well thus far. All participants judged it appropriate to continue the process of reducing the Federal Reserve’s securities holdings. Almost all participants supported a slowing of the pace of runoff at this meeting. Most participants noted the importance of clearly communicating that slowing the runoff pace had no implications for the stance of monetary policy, would not affect the long-term path of the balance sheet, was a natural progression of the slowing decided at the May 2024 meeting, and was in line with the Committee’s principles and plans for balance sheet reduction announced in 2022. Some participants noted that a slower pace of runoff would also help guard against reserve scarcity emerging with little advance notice during a period of potentially rapid increase in the TGA. Several participants did not see a compelling case for slowing the pace of runoff at this meeting. A number of participants commented that the Committee’s existing tools could also be used to help address potential disruptions to the market for reserves. Some participants highlighted the importance of the Federal Reserve’s ceiling tools and encouraged the ongoing efforts of the Desk to improve the efficacy of the standing repo facility. Several participants observed that the Federal Reserve’s traditional tool of open market operations could also be used should signs of reserve scarcity unexpectedly emerge. Many participants expressed interest in continued discussion of technical aspects of balance sheet policy and tools after the framework review is completed. 12 March 18–19, 2025 Committee Policy Actions In their discussions of monetary policy for this meeting, members agreed that recent indicators suggested that economic activity had continued to expand at a solid pace. The unemployment rate had stabilized at a low level in recent months, and labor market conditions had remained solid. Members concurred that inflation remained somewhat elevated. Members assessed that uncertainty around the economic outlook had increased and agreed that they were attentive to the risks to both sides of the Committee’s dual mandate. In support of its goals, the Committee agreed to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 4¼ to 4½ percent. Members agreed that in considering the extent and timing of additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee would carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. Almost all members agreed to reducing the Committee’s securities holdings at a slower pace, with the monthly redemption cap on Treasury securities reduced from $25 billion to $5 billion and the monthly redemption cap on agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities maintained at $35 billion. One member agreed with the Committee’s decision to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 4¼ to 4½ percent but voted against the overall decision because he preferred to continue the pace of decline in securities holdings in place at the time of the vote. All members agreed that the postmeeting statement should affirm their strong commitment both to supporting maximum employment and to returning inflation to the Committee’s 2 percent objective. Members agreed that in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee would continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. They would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerged that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals. Members also agreed that their assessments would take into account a wide range of information, including readings on labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the following domestic policy directive, for release at 2:00 p.m.: “Effective March 20, 2025, the Federal Open Market Committee directs the Desk to: • Undertake open market operations as necessary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of 4¼ to 4½ percent. • Conduct standing overnight repurchase agreement operations with a minimum bid rate of 4.5 percent and with an aggregate operation limit of $500 billion. Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee 13 • Conduct standing overnight reverse repurchase agreement operations at an offering rate of 4.25 percent and with a per-counterparty limit of $160 billion per day. • Roll over at auction the amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of Treasury securities maturing in March that exceeds a cap of $25 billion per month. Beginning on April 1, roll over at auction the amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of Treasury securities maturing in each calendar month that exceeds a cap of $5 billion per month. Redeem Treasury coupon securities up to these monthly caps and Treasury bills to the extent that coupon principal payments are less than the monthly caps. • Reinvest the amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) received in each calendar month that exceeds a cap of $35 billion per month into Treasury securities to roughly match the maturity composition of Treasury securities outstanding. • Allow modest deviations from stated amounts for reinvestments, if needed for operational reasons.” The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below for release at 2:00 p.m.: “Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace. The unemployment rate has stabilized at a low level in recent months, and labor market conditions remain solid. Inflation remains somewhat elevated. The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. Uncertainty around the economic outlook has increased. The Committee is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate. In support of its goals, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 4¼ to 4½ percent. In considering the extent and timing of additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. The Committee will continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage‑backed securities. Beginning in April, the Committee will slow the pace of decline of its securities holdings by reducing the monthly redemption cap on Treasury securities from $25 billion to $5 billion. The Committee will maintain the monthly redemption cap on agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities at $35 billion. The Committee is strongly committed to supporting maximum employment and returning inflation to its 2 percent objective. 14 March 18–19, 2025 In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals. The Committee’s assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.” Voting for this action: Jerome H. Powell, John C. Williams, Michael S. Barr, Michelle W. Bowman, Susan M. Collins, Lisa D. Cook, Austan D. Goolsbee, Philip N. Jefferson, Adriana D. Kugler, Alberto G. Musalem, and Jeffrey R. Schmid. Voting against this action: Christopher J. Waller. Governor Waller preferred no change in the federal funds target range and continuing the pace of decline in securities holdings in place at the time of the vote. This view was based on reserve balances being over $3 trillion as well as no evidence from money market indicators or his outreach conversations that the banking system is getting close to an ample level of reserves. In addition, rather than changing the pace of balance sheet reduction, he thought the Federal Reserve should rely on its existing tools and develop a plan for how to respond to short-run strains if they emerge. Consistent with the Committee’s decision to leave the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted unanimously to maintain the interest rate paid on reserve balances at 4.4 percent, effective March 20, 2025. The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted unanimously to approve the establishment of the primary credit rate at the existing level of 4.5 percent, effective March 20, 2025. It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Tuesday–Wednesday, May 6– 7, 2025. The meeting adjourned at 10:25 a.m. on March 19, 2025. Notation Vote By notation vote completed on February 18, 2025, the Committee unanimously approved the minutes of the Committee meeting held on January 28–29, 2025. Attendance Jerome H.

{"date": "2025-05-07", "year": 2025, "source_type": "FOMC Minutes", "url": "https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20250507.pdf", "text": "FOMC FEDERAL RESERV E SYSTEM Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee May 6–7, 2025 Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee May 6–7, 2025 A joint meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System was held in the offices of the Board of Governors on Tuesday, May 6, 2025, at 8:30 a.m. and continued on Wednesday, May 7, 2025, at 9:00 a.m.1 Review of Monetary Policy Strategy, Tools, and Communications Committee participants continued their discussions related to their review of the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy framework, with a focus on the price-stability side of the dual mandate and the FOMC’s monetary policy strategy. The staff briefed policymakers on lessons drawn from the experiences of the U.S. and other economies with inflation over the past five years and the possible implications for monetary policy. The staff discussed the role of large and persistent demand and supply shifts, the way production capacity constraints amplified supply–demand imbalances, and the degree to which labor market tightness contributed to inflation both in the U.S. and abroad. The staff considered the role of stable longer-term inflation expectations in limiting the magnitude and persistence of the post-pandemic inflation surge and facilitating disinflation without significant damage to the labor market. The staff also considered whether medium-term inflation risks have become more balanced around the 2 percent objective than they were during the pre-pandemic period, when the proximity of the policy rate to the effective lower bound (ELB) appeared to contribute to inflation running persistently below 2 percent. They presented model-based analysis of the costs and benefits of different inflation-targeting strategies in conditions of low levels of aggregate demand and inflation as well as in situations in which simultaneously high inflation and unemployment lead to a tradeoff between the Committee’s inflation and employment objectives. In their discussions, participants strongly reaffirmed their commitment to the 2 percent longer-run inflation objective and to the importance of longer-term inflation expectations being firmly anchored at that target rate. They emphasized that anchored inflation expectations help the Committee in achieving price stability, thereby enhancing the Committee’s ability to promote maximum employment. Some participants also noted that short-term inflation expectations matter for economic decisions and 1 The Federal Open Market Committee is referenced as the “FOMC” and the “Committee” in these minutes; the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System is referenced as the “Board” in these minutes. 2 May 6–7, 2025 can affect the persistence of inflation. Participants agreed that a commitment to its explicit 2 percent inflation objective, along with anchored longer-term inflation expectations at that level, enhances the Committee’s transparency and accountability and bolsters the effectiveness of monetary policy. Participants discussed the advantages and disadvantages of flexible average inflation targeting, under which monetary policy seeks to make up for persistently below-objective inflation to achieve average inflation of 2 percent, and flexible inflation targeting, under which policy seeks to return inflation to 2 percent without making up for previous deviations from target. Participants generally observed that when the risks of the policy rate hitting the ELB were more prominent and inflation was persistently running below the target, flexible average inflation targeting could have potentially limited the risk of longer-run inflation expectations becoming unanchored to the downside. Participants noted, however, that the strategy of flexible average inflation targeting has diminished benefits in an environment with a substantial risk of large inflationary shocks or when ELB risks are less prominent. Participants indicated that they thought it would be appropriate to reconsider the average inflation--targeting language in the Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy. Participants noted that an effective monetary policy strategy must be robust to a wide variety of economic environments. They viewed flexible inflation targeting as a more robust policy strategy capable of correcting persistent deviations of inflation from either side of the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run objective. Participants also noted that the Committee’s strategy should reflect its willingness to make forceful use of all available tools as appropriate should the risks of hitting the ELB again materialize. Developments in Financial Markets and Open Market Operations The manager turned first to a review of financial market developments. Amid significant market volatility over the intermeeting period, longer-maturity Treasury yields rose, broad equity price indexes changed little on net, credit spreads widened, and the dollar depreciated. The manager observed that market participants appeared to interpret recently announced trade policy changes as a negative supply shock that could restrain domestic activity relative to foreign activity in the near term. The manager noted that respondents to the Open Market Desk’s Survey of Market Expectations had materially lowered their gross domestic product (GDP) forecasts and raised their inflation forecasts for this year while significantly increasing the probability they placed on a recession occurring within the next six months. The dollar depreciated substantially against most major currencies, as the trade-weighted broad dollar index declined over 2 percent. Market contacts attributed the decline to increased foreign exchange hedging prompted by heightened policy uncertainty and concerns that trade policy could pose greater downside risks to the U.S. than to other economies. The manager noted that the dollar had depreciated even though U.S. interest rates had risen more than foreign interest rates and prices of Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee 3 risky assets had declined, which historically have been associated with dollar appreciation. Liquidity in foreign exchange markets deteriorated but was roughly in line with the historical relationship between liquidity and measures of market volatility. The Treasury yield curve steepened materially, as short-term Treasury yields declined about 20 basis points over the intermeeting period while longer-term yields increased on net. Measures of Treasury market liquidity deteriorated immediately after the announcement of higher-than-expected tariffs on April 2 and partially recovered later in the period. The deterioration in liquidity, however, was commensurate with the historical relationship between measures of market volatility and liquidity, and the Treasury market continued to function well. The manager noted that an unwinding of positions that had sought to profit on spreads between Treasury yields and interest rate swaps appeared to have been a factor in the deterioration of liquidity and the associated rise in longer-term yields. By contrast, positions held in order to arbitrage the basis between Treasury cash and futures prices had appeared to remain largely stable. Inflation expectations increased modestly at short horizons but remained stable at longer horizons. While equity prices declined sharply early in the period, these movements subsequently retraced, and broad equity indexes were essentially unchanged on net. However, equity prices remained below their peak levels in mid-February, and options prices indicated greater investor demand for protection against further equity price declines. Corporate bond and leveraged loan spreads widened on net. Primary issuance had briefly paused at the height of market volatility but subsequently resumed. Market contacts suggested that, rather than disinvesting away from U.S. assets, global investors had instead sought to increase their hedging against the risk of further dollar depreciation. The manager noted that no evidence indicated that foreign investors had sold material amounts of U.S. assets. Available data pointed to modest outflows from fixed-income securities that were largely offset by inflows into equity securities. The manager, however, observed that large global investors tend to change their investment strategies only slowly and that potential future geographic asset re- allocations will depend on the evolution of the global economic outlook. The modal implied policy path based on options prices, which is a proxy for market baseline policy expectations, moved down some over the period and was consistent with either one or two 25 basis point rate cuts by the end of the year—only slightly more than at the time of the March FOMC meeting. The option-implied distribution of rate outcomes around year-end shifted to the left and became more skewed to the downside. The market perception that risks to the policy rate tilted more to the downside accounts for the fact that the futures-based expected policy path shifted down more over the period and was consistent with around three rate cuts by year-end. The median modal path for the federal funds rate from the Survey of Market Expectations was not much changed and indicated 4 May 6–7, 2025 either two or three rate cuts this year. However, the survey pointed to increased disagreement across respondents as to the most likely path of policy. Despite the volatility in broader markets over the intermeeting period, money market functioning had remained orderly. Rates on Treasury repurchase agreements (repo) were somewhat higher, on average, over the period, but there had been no significant strains in that market. A range of core indicators continued to suggest that reserves remained abundant. The manager noted some movement in one of the Desk’s indicators arising from a modest increase in federal funds borrowing by some domestic banks in the second half of April; however, that development appeared related to tax flows and was not indicative of tighter reserves conditions. The manager observed that reserves stood above $3.2 trillion and were expected to increase as the Treasury General Account (TGA) declined until resolution of the debt limit situation. Take-up at the overnight reverse repurchase agreement (ON RRP) facility had increased but remained low in absolute terms. Following the FOMC’s decision to slow the pace of balance sheet runoff at its March meeting, respondents to the Survey of Market Expectations moved their expected date for the end of balance sheet runoff back, on average, to January 2026 and slightly lowered their estimates for the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet at the time that runoff stopped. The manager reported that the Desk’s technical exercises offering early settlement of the standing repo facility (SRF) conducted around the March quarter-end had gone smoothly and were well received. Market outreach indicated that dealers had a higher willingness to use the facility when early settlement was offered, and the Desk planned to make the addition of an option for early settlement a regular part of the SRF schedule starting in late June. The Committee voted unanimously to renew the dollar and foreign currency liquidity swap arrangements with the Bank of Canada, the Bank of England, the Bank of Japan, the European Central Bank, and the Swiss National Bank. In addition, the Committee voted unanimously to renew the reciprocal currency arrangements with the Bank of Canada and the Bank of Mexico; these arrangements are associated with the Federal Reserve’s participation in the North American Framework Agreement of 1994. The votes to renew the Federal Reserve’s participation in these standing arrangements occur annually at the April or May FOMC meeting. By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk’s domestic transactions over the intermeeting period. There were no intervention operations in foreign currencies for the System’s account during the intermeeting period. Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee 5 Staff Review of the Economic Situation The information available at the time of the meeting indicated that consumer price inflation remained somewhat elevated. The unemployment rate had stabilized at a relatively low level since the middle of last year, but reported real GDP growth stepped down markedly in the first quarter of 2025. Total consumer price inflation—as measured by the 12-month change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE)—was 2.3 percent in March. Core PCE price inflation, which excludes changes in consumer energy prices and many consumer food prices, was 2.6 percent in March. Both total and core inflation were lower than their year-earlier levels. Recent data indicated that labor market conditions had remained solid. The unemployment rate was 4.2 percent in March and April, equal to its average over the second half of 2024. The participation rate had risen 0.2 percentage point since February, and the employment-to-population ratio had edged up 0.1 percentage point over the same period. Average monthly gains for total nonfarm payrolls over March and April were solid and roughly in line with the average pace seen over 2024. The ratio of job vacancies to unemployed workers was 1.0 in April, slightly below its average over 2019. The employment cost index for total hourly compensation of private industry workers rose 3.4 percent over the 12 months ending in March, well below its year-earlier level. Average hourly earnings for all employees rose 3.8 percent over the 12 months ending in April, little changed from a year ago. According to the advance estimate, real GDP declined slightly in the first quarter. However, this first- quarter estimate was likely affected by measurement issues. Real imports of goods and services soared in the first quarter, likely driven by front-loading of imports—especially consumer goods—ahead of anticipated tariff hikes. Given relatively tepid export growth, the net exports category made a large negative contribution to measured GDP growth in the first quarter. Based on available data, the outsized increase in imports did not seem to be fully matched by corresponding increases in other categories of spending, including inventory investment, resulting in a small decline in estimated real GDP. By contrast, real private domestic final purchases (PDFP)—which comprises PCE and private fixed investment and which often provides a better signal than GDP of underlying economic momentum—posted a solid gain in the first quarter that was similar to its average rate of increase over 2024. Indicators of foreign economic activity pointed to a moderate pace of expansion in the first quarter, likely supported in part by front-loaded demand from U.S. importers in anticipation of tariff hikes. However, more recent indicators suggested weakening momentum, notably in Canada and Mexico, amid elevated uncertainty about global trade policies. Inflation abroad was near central bank targets 6 May 6–7, 2025 in most foreign economies, in part reflecting lower energy prices. By contrast, Chinese inflation remained quite subdued. The European Central Bank, the Bank of Mexico, and several central banks in emerging Asia eased monetary policy, citing in part the prospective drag on domestic growth from U.S. tariffs. In their communications, foreign central banks also emphasized the need to maintain policy flexibility amid heightened uncertainty. Staff Review of the Financial Situation Over the intermeeting period, the market-implied path of the federal funds rate over the next few meetings edged up, on net, but declined somewhat toward the end of the year, as the announcements on new U.S. tariffs left investors more concerned about the near-term outlooks for both inflation and growth. Near-term inflation compensation rose notably, while longer-term inflation compensation appeared to remain well anchored. Against the backdrop of heightened volatility, yields on shorter- and medium-term nominal Treasury securities declined, but longer-term rates rose somewhat. The increase in longer-term yields appeared to be partly attributable to higher term premiums. Prices of risky assets were extremely volatile over the intermeeting period amid multiple tariff-related developments. On net, broad equity prices ended the period little changed, and the VIX—a forward- looking measure of near-term equity market volatility—rose notably before partially retracing and ending the period at a modestly elevated level. Credit spreads widened, on net, especially for speculative-grade bonds, consistent with increased concerns about economic growth. Spreads, however, remained at low levels. Tariff announcements led to a significant deterioration in global risk sentiment, which largely reversed following a subsequent pause of some of the tariffs and growing investor optimism about easing of trade tensions. On net, foreign equity prices moved down somewhat, while corporate bond spreads widened moderately. Market-based policy expectations and near-term inflation compensation declined notably in Europe. The dollar depreciated against many advanced foreign economy (AFE) currencies despite widening U.S.–AFE yield differentials. Market participants generally attributed dollar weakness to concerns about potential adverse effects of trade policy on the U.S. growth outlook. Conditions in U.S. short-term funding markets remained orderly. While the TGA increased in the latter part of the period because of incoming tax receipts, it was expected to resume its decline. This dynamic, if realized, will boost the sum of ON RRP take-up and reserve balances until the resolution of the federal debt limit situation and will tend to put downward pressure on short-term market rates. In domestic credit markets, most borrowing costs for businesses, households, and municipalities increased notably in response to the tariff news. Yields increased from already elevated levels for an Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee 7 array of fixed-income securities, including investment-grade corporate bonds and senior commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) tranches, largely as a result of higher credit spreads. Rates on 30-year fixed-rate conforming residential mortgages edged down. Interest rates for credit card offers inched up in February, while those on new auto loans were little changed over the intermeeting period on net. Meanwhile, interest rates on commercial and industrial (C&I) loans and small business loans remained elevated in the first quarter. Financing through capital markets and nonbank lenders was generally less available in the latter part of the intermeeting period than earlier in the period, especially for speculative-grade bonds. Issuance of corporate bonds and leveraged loans stopped during peak market turmoil in early April but resumed as market sentiment recovered. Issuance of investment-grade corporate bonds returned at a strong pace, particularly in the first week of May, while that of speculative-grade bonds and leveraged loans remained subdued. Regarding bank credit, banks in the April Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices (SLOOS) reported unchanged loan standards across all loan categories, on net, over the first quarter.2 C&I loan balances edged down in the first quarter. Large banks reported easing lending standards or leaving them unchanged for all commercial real estate (CRE) loan categories, while smaller banks tightened standards or left them unchanged. Consumer credit continued to be generally available for most households. Growth in consumer credit on banks’ books stepped up in the first quarter, and responses to the April SLOOS showed a net easing of consumer lending standards in the first quarter. Credit continued to be easily available for high-credit-score mortgage borrowers but was not easily available for lower-credit-score borrowers. Credit quality remained stable for large and midsize firms, most categories of mortgages, and consumer loans, but it continued to deteriorate in other sectors. The credit performance of corporate bonds, leveraged loans, and private credit loans was generally stable in the first quarter. Credit quality concerns in the CRE market broadened beyond office properties. Even so, average CMBS delinquency rates were little changed in March, as declining office and multifamily delinquencies offset a rise in the retail and hotel sectors. Regarding household credit quality, the rate of serious delinquencies on Federal Housing Administration mortgages continued to rise in February to above pre-pandemic levels. By contrast, delinquency rates on most other mortgage loan types remained at historical lows. In the fourth quarter of last year, credit card delinquency rates edged down, and auto delinquency rates were about unchanged, but both remained at elevated levels. 2 The SLOOS results reported are based on banks’ responses, weighted by each bank’s outstanding loans in the respective loan category, and might therefore differ from the results reported in the published SLOOS, which are based on banks’ unweighted responses. 8 May 6–7, 2025 The staff provided an updated assessment of the stability of the U.S. financial system and, on balance, continued to characterize the system’s financial vulnerabilities as notable. The staff judged that asset valuation pressures were notable. Equity valuations declined but still stood at the upper end of their historical distribution, spreads on high-yield corporate bonds widened and stood around the middle of their historical distribution, and housing valuations remained quite high amid increased risks to the economic outlook and the appearance of ebbing risk appetite. Vulnerabilities associated with business and household debt were characterized as moderate. The ability of publicly traded firms to service their debt had improved slightly, partly reflecting stable earnings. That said, riskier firms continued to face high debt service costs relative to historical ranges. Household balance sheets remained solid overall, though delinquency rates on auto and credit card loans were elevated. Vulnerabilities associated with leverage in the financial sector were characterized as notable. Regulatory capital ratios in the banking sector remained high. Banks, however, were still seen as exposed to some interest rate risk. In the nonbank sector, leverage at hedge funds stayed high. Vulnerabilities associated with funding risks were characterized as moderate. The liquidity mismatch of assets and liabilities at mutual funds was evident amid substantial outflows in the first week of April. Nevertheless, the outflows were not sustained and did not ultimately strain overall liquidity in the markets in which the mutual funds invest. Banks reduced their reliance on uninsured deposits notably since the end of 2021. Staff Economic Outlook The staff projection for real GDP growth in 2025 and 2026 was weaker than the one prepared for the March meeting, as announced trade policies implied a larger drag on real activity relative to the policies that the staff had assumed in their previous forecast. Trade policies were also expected to lead to slower productivity growth and therefore to reduce potential GDP growth over the next few years. With the drag on demand expected to start earlier and to be larger than the supply response, the output gap was projected to widen significantly over the forecast period. The labor market was expected to weaken substantially, with the unemployment rate forecast moving above the staff’s estimate of its natural rate by the end of this year and remaining above the natural rate through 2027. The staff’s inflation projection was higher than the one prepared for the March meeting. Tariffs were expected to boost inflation markedly this year and to provide a smaller boost in 2026; after that, inflation was projected to decline to 2 percent by 2027. Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee 9 The staff continued to note the large amount of uncertainty surrounding trade policy and other economic policies and now viewed the uncertainty around the projection as elevated relative to the average over the past 20 years. Risks to real activity were seen as skewed to the downside, and the staff viewed the possibility that the economy would enter a recession to be almost as likely as the baseline forecast. The substantial upward revision to the inflation forecast in 2025 was judged to leave the risks around the inflation projection balanced in that year. Thereafter, the staff continued to view the risks around the inflation forecast as skewed to the upside, with recent increases in some measures of inflation expectations raising the possibility that inflation would prove to be more persistent than the baseline projection assumed. Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook Participants observed that, even though swings in net exports had affected the data, the available data indicated that economic activity had continued to expand at a solid pace and labor market conditions continued to be solid, but inflation remained somewhat elevated. Participants assessed that the tariff increases announced so far had been significantly larger and broader than they had anticipated. Participants observed that there was considerable uncertainty surrounding the evolution of trade policy as well as about the scale, scope, timing, and persistence of associated economic effects. Significant uncertainties also surrounded changes in fiscal, regulatory, and immigration policies and their economic effects. Taken together, participants saw the uncertainty about their economic outlooks as unusually elevated. Overall, participants judged that downside risks to employment and economic activity and upside risks to inflation had risen, primarily reflecting the potential effects of tariff increases. Participants observed that inflation had eased significantly since its peak in 2022 but remained somewhat elevated relative to the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run goal. Participants noted that progress on disinflation had been uneven recently, with elevated monthly readings in January and February having been followed by a relatively low reading in March. With regard to the outlook for inflation, participants judged that it was likely to be boosted by the effects of higher tariffs, although significant uncertainty surrounded those effects. Many participants remarked that reports from their business contacts or surveys indicated that firms generally were planning to either partially or fully pass on tariff-related cost increases to consumers. Several participants noted that firms not directly subject to tariffs might take the opportunity to increase their prices if other prices rise. Some participants assessed that the recent increase in short-term inflation expectations, as indicated by various survey- and market-based measures, or the fact that the economy had gone through a period of high inflation recently could make firms more willing to raise prices. While most indicators had suggested that longer-term inflation expectations remained well anchored, some participants saw the risk that they could drift upward, which could put additional upward pressure on inflation. Some 10 May 6–7, 2025 participants assessed that tariffs on intermediate goods could contribute to a more persistent increase in inflation. A few participants noted that supply chain disruptions caused by tariffs also could have persistent effects on inflation, reminiscent of such effects during the pandemic. Several participants highlighted factors that might help mitigate the magnitude and persistence of potential increases in inflation, such as reductions of tariff increases from ongoing trade negotiations, less tolerance for price increases by households, a weakening of the economy, reduced housing inflation pressures from lower immigration, or a desire by some firms to increase market share rather than raise prices on items not affected by tariffs. Participants judged that labor market conditions remained broadly in balance. The unemployment rate remained low and had stayed in a narrow range over the past year. Payroll employment gains were solid in April and at levels consistent with the unemployment rate being stable given a flat participation rate and low immigration. Layoffs remained low. Some participants noted, however, that their contacts and business survey respondents reported limiting or pausing hiring because of elevated uncertainty. Participants assessed that there was a risk that the labor market would weaken in coming months, that considerable uncertainty surrounded the outlook for the labor market, and that outcomes would depend importantly on the evolution of trade policy as well as other government policies. Nominal wage growth continued to moderate. Several participants commented that labor market conditions were unlikely to be a source of inflationary pressure. Participants observed that the available data suggested that the economy had continued to grow at a solid pace. Real GDP edged down in the first quarter, but several participants observed that the decline may be the result of measurement issues, as a surge of imports ahead of expected tariff increases likely was not fully reflected in the data for inventories and spending. PDFP, which is often a better indicator than GDP of underlying economic momentum, rose at a solid pace in the first quarter. Participants observed that consumer spending grew solidly in March. Several participants commented that, other than apparent front-running effects seen in some spending categories, effects of tariff- related developments were not widely evident in the aggregate consumer spending data. However, participants noted that various surveys indicated a sharp deterioration in consumer sentiment, though several also commented that consumer sentiment had not been a good predictor of consumer spending in recent years. Several participants noted that factors such as elevated economic uncertainty and a possible decline in real disposable income due to tariff-related increases in prices could lead to increased precautionary saving and reduced consumer demand. A couple of participants noted that a deterioration in financial market sentiment could also weigh on consumer demand. Regarding factors that might mitigate negative effects of tariffs on consumer spending, a few participants observed that the strength in the balance sheets of many households could help them absorb a tariff-induced reduction in their purchasing power; lower energy prices might help Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee 11 lessen strains on households’ budgets; and households might shift spending from goods to services, which are likely to be less affected by tariffs. With regard to the business sector, participants observed that the growth in business fixed investment was solid in the first quarter. However, participants also noted that their contacts or surveys reported sharp declines in business sentiment, and many participants remarked that those reports also revealed that many firms were pausing or delaying their capital expenditure plans amid increased uncertainty. Several participants noted that sentiment was generally downbeat among manufacturers because of a rise or prospective rise in input costs as well as concerns about potential supply chain disruptions. A few participants commented that retailers were downbeat because the breadth of tariffs made cost increases unavoidable for them. Several participants commented that small businesses could be especially vulnerable to the effects of tariffs, as they had less capacity to absorb margin reductions and were likely less able to diversify away from imported items. Several participants highlighted the strains faced by the agricultural sector, as tariffs threatened to further compress farm profit margins by lowering farm export prices and raising input costs. A couple of participants noted that their contacts in the energy sector expected growth in the sector to be limited, as energy prices had declined to near the level at which expanding capacity is no longer profitable for many domestic producers. Several participants noted that some hospital systems, universities, and nonprofit organizations were under strains due to government funding cuts and restrictions on immigration. Some participants discussed various considerations that could help alleviate anticipated pressures on the business sector, including less restrictive regulations and lower business taxes; relatively strong firm balance sheets, which could help firms absorb a tariff-related hit to profit margins; ongoing trade negotiations to lower tariffs; and increased demand directed to firms that are less affected by tariffs. In their discussion of financial stability, participants who commented noted vulnerabilities to the financial system that they assessed warranted monitoring. Some participants discussed the heightened volatility seen across a range of asset markets over the first half of April, noting that markets had continued to function and were able to accommodate a surge in trading volumes despite lower measures of liquidity. Several participants observed that resilience in the Treasury market was of special importance and had been a focus of attention for a number of years. Some participants commented on a change from the typical pattern of correlations across asset prices during the first half of April, with longer-term Treasury yields rising and the dollar depreciating despite the decline in the prices of equities and other risky assets. These participants noted that a durable shift in such correlations or a diminution of the perceived safe-haven status of U.S. assets could have long-lasting implications for the economy. While noting that asset prices had declined somewhat, several participants observed that downside risks to the outlook had increased, leading them to question 12 May 6–7, 2025 whether asset prices had actually gotten closer to fundamental valuations. Some participants mentioned high levels of leverage at hedge funds or potential concerns about private credit and equity. While judging that balance sheet conditions for households, nonfinancial businesses, and banks appeared to be solid, several participants noted that an economic downturn or higher interest rates could lead to a deterioration in those conditions. A few participants commented that central clearing of the SRF could encourage its use during times of market stress, which would help alleviate such stresses. In their consideration of monetary policy at this meeting, participants noted that inflation remained somewhat elevated. Participants also observed that recent indicators suggested that economic activity had continued to expand at a solid pace. They noted that swings in net exports appeared to have not been fully reflected in inventory and spending data, which complicated the interpretation of the recent data on economic activity. Participants further noted that the unemployment rate had stabilized at a low level and that labor market conditions had remained solid in recent months. In this context, and amid a further increase in uncertainty about the economic outlook and a rise in the risks of both higher unemployment and higher inflation, all participants viewed it as appropriate to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 4¼ to 4½ percent. Participants judged it appropriate to continue the process of reducing the Federal Reserve’s securities holdings. In considering the outlook for monetary policy, participants agreed that with economic growth and the labor market still solid and current monetary policy moderately restrictive, the Committee was well positioned to wait for more clarity on the outlooks for inflation and economic activity. Participants agreed that uncertainty about the economic outlook had increased further, making it appropriate to take a cautious approach until the net economic effects of the array of changes to government policies become clearer. Participants noted that monetary policy would be informed by a wide range of incoming data, the economic outlook, and the balance of risks. In discussing risk-management considerations that could bear on the outlook for monetary policy, participants agreed that the risks of higher inflation and higher unemployment had risen. Almost all participants commented on the risk that inflation could prove to be more persistent than expected. Participants emphasized the importance of ensuring that longer-term inflation expectations remained well anchored, with some noting that expectations might be particularly sensitive because inflation had been above the Committee’s target for an extended period. Participants noted that the Committee might face difficult tradeoffs if inflation proves to be more persistent while the outlooks for growth and employment weaken. Participants observed, however, that the ultimate extent of changes to government policy and their effects on the economy was highly uncertain. A few participants additionally noted that higher uncertainty could restrain business and consumer demand and that Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee 13 inflationary pressures could be damped if downside risks to economic activity or the labor market materialized. Committee Policy Actions In their discussions of monetary policy for this meeting, members agreed that recent indicators suggested that economic activity had continued to expand at a solid pace. Recognizing the measurement difficulties induced by the unusual movements in net exports in the first quarter, as businesses apparently brought in imports ahead of expected tariff increases, members agreed to acknowledge that swings in net exports had affected the data. Members agreed that the unemployment rate had stabilized at a low level in recent months, and labor market conditions had remained solid. Members concurred that inflation remained somewhat elevated. Members assessed that uncertainty about the economic outlook had increased further and agreed that they were attentive to the risks to both sides of the Committee’s dual mandate while judging that the risks of higher unemployment and higher inflation had risen. In support of its goals, the Committee agreed to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 4¼ to 4½ percent. Members agreed that in considering the extent and timing of additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee would carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. All members agreed that the postmeeting statement should affirm their strong commitment both to supporting maximum employment and to returning inflation to the Committee’s 2 percent objective. Members agreed that, in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee would continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. They would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerged that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals. Members also agreed that their assessments would take into account a wide range of information, including readings on labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Open Market Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive, for release at 2:00 p.m.: “Effective May 8, 2025, the Federal Open Market Committee directs the Desk to: • Undertake open market operations as necessary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of 4¼ to 4½ percent. • Conduct standing overnight repurchase agreement operations with a minimum bid rate of 4.5 percent and with an aggregate operation limit of $500 billion. 14 May 6–7, 2025 • Conduct standing overnight reverse repurchase agreement operations at an offering rate of 4.25 percent and with a per-counterparty limit of $160 billion per day. • Roll over at auction the amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of Treasury securities maturing in each calendar month that exceeds a cap of $5 billion per month. Redeem Treasury coupon securities up to this monthly cap and Treasury bills to the extent that coupon principal payments are less than the monthly cap. • Reinvest the amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) received in each calendar month that exceeds a cap of $35 billion per month into Treasury securities to roughly match the maturity composition of Treasury securities outstanding. • Allow modest deviations from stated amounts for reinvestments, if needed for operational reasons.” The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below for release at 2:00 p.m.: “Although swings in net exports have affected the data, recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace. The unemployment rate has stabilized at a low level in recent months, and labor market conditions remain solid. Inflation remains somewhat elevated. The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. Uncertainty about the economic outlook has increased further. The Committee is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate and judges that the risks of higher unemployment and higher inflation have risen. In support of its goals, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 4¼ to 4½ percent. In considering the extent and timing of additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. The Committee will continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities. The Committee is strongly committed to supporting maximum employment and returning inflation to its 2 percent objective. In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals. The Committee’s assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.” Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee 15 Voting for this action: Jerome H.

The staff reviewed qualitative and quantitative tools that are commonly used to measure uncertainty about the economic outlook and the balance of risks, drawing on U.S. and international experience. The staff then discussed monetary policy strategies that aim to be robust to a variety of economic environments and ways in which risk-management considerations can be incorporated into monetary policy analysis and decisionmaking. The staff also considered the role of scenario analysis as a tool to communicate to the public risks and uncertainty around the economic outlook and their implications for monetary policy. Participants noted that risks and uncertainty are important factors affecting their decisionmaking and emphasized the need for a policy strategy that aims to achieve the Committee’s maximum- employment and price-stability objectives across a wide range of highly uncertain developments. Participants acknowledged that risks and uncertainty about the economy are pervasive and pose challenges to both the design and communication of monetary policy. They remarked that measuring and assessing risks and uncertainty are difficult and that the Committee has been well served by relying on a wide range of indicators, as well as information from business and community contacts, to gauge evolving risks, especially during periods of heightened uncertainty. Participants remarked that effective communications about risks and uncertainty help the public understand the Committee’s decisions and enhance the transparency, accountability, and effectiveness of monetary policy decisions. Participants had a preliminary discussion about a range of 1 The Federal Open Market Committee is referenced as the “FOMC” and the “Committee” in these minutes; the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System is referenced as the “Board” in these minutes. 2 June 17-18, 2025 issues related to enhancing the Committee’s suite of communication tools, including possible changes to the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) and a potential broader use of alternative scenarios. Participants highlighted, however, the challenges associated with adjustments to these tools and noted that any revisions to the Committee’s communication policies would need to be considered carefully and receive broad support across participants. Participants agreed to continue their discussions of ways to enhance the Committee’s communication tools and practices once they completed their review of their Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy. Participants expected that they would complete that review by late summer. Developments in Financial Markets and Open Market Operations The manager turned first to a review of financial market developments. Over the intermeeting period, policy expectations and Treasury yields rose modestly, credit spreads narrowed, and equity prices increased. Markets were attentive to the de-escalation of trade tensions; generally weaker-than- expected economic data releases, with the notable exception of the May employment report; and prospects for fiscal expansion. These factors, on net, resulted in some paring back of investors’ perception of downside risk to growth and upside risk to inflation. Results from the Open Market Desk’s Survey of Market Expectations were consistent with this interpretation: The median respondent’s expectations for real gross domestic product (GDP) growth and personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation for 2025 retraced some of the moves that occurred after the April tariff announcements, though growth expectations were still materially lower and inflation expectations remained higher relative to the March survey. The median respondent’s modal path for the federal funds rate in the June survey shifted higher through 2026 and implied two 25 basis point rate cuts both this year and next year. Market-based policy expectations were largely consistent with survey results, with both the futures-based average federal funds rate path and the options-based modal federal funds rate path shifting higher over the intermeeting period. Overall, the changes in the intermeeting period brought policy expectations for the next few quarters back close to where they stood at the time of the March FOMC meeting. However, futures-based policy expectations beyond the next few quarters had not fully retraced the decline seen over the previous intermeeting period, suggesting that perceived medium- and longer- term downside risks to growth remained larger than before the April tariff announcements. Nominal Treasury yields rose 15 to 20 basis points, on net, over the intermeeting period. The manager observed that the rise in shorter-maturity yields was consistent with the upward shift in the expected policy rate path. The rise in longer-maturity yields appeared to reflect, in part, market participants’ increasing fiscal concerns: In response to a Desk survey question about the top factors behind the Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee 3 respondents’ forecast of the 10-year yield over the next two years, the fiscal outlook was the factor cited by the largest number of respondents. Market-implied inflation compensation for the year ahead fell about 20 basis points over the intermeeting period, while longer-term inflation compensation measures were little changed. Liquidity conditions for nominal Treasury securities had improved as volatility declined following the stress seen in the previous intermeeting period. The events of April, and the more recent focus in markets around fiscal sustainability issues, did not appear to have affected demand for Treasury securities at auction; an index of auction performance derived from a number of metrics indicated that auction performance had improved modestly over the past several quarters and was currently in line with the longer-run average. Regarding foreign exchange developments, the broad trade-weighted dollar index fell further during the intermeeting period despite increases in U.S. equity prices and short-term Treasury yields. The manager noted that dollar depreciation continued to be consistent with larger downside revisions to the U.S. growth outlook relative to other major economies, which induced increased currency hedging flows by foreign investors in U.S. assets. The manager also remarked that the sensitivity of the foreign exchange value of the dollar to domestic economic surprises had not fundamentally changed. The available data continued to suggest stability in foreign holdings of U.S. assets. The manager turned next to money markets and Desk operations. Unsecured overnight rates remained stable over the intermeeting period. Rates in the repurchase agreement (repo) market were softer relative to the previous intermeeting period, including at the May month-end, as reductions in net Treasury bill issuance amid the ongoing debt limit situation resulted in increased demand for repo. With the softness in repo making the overnight reverse repurchase agreement (ON RRP) facility more attractive on a relative basis, usage of the ON RRP facility had been broadly stable, except for the typical spike at month-end. Since the start of the debt issuance suspension period in January, the Treasury General Account (TGA) had declined nearly $420 billion, ON RRP balances had increased about $75 billion, and reserves had increased $150 billion. Key indicators continued to suggest that reserves, which stood at nearly $3.5 trillion, were well into the abundant range. Once the debt limit was addressed, however, the TGA was likely to be rebuilt fairly quickly, which would drain liquidity from the system and result in fast declines in both ON RRP and reserve balances. The manager also discussed the trajectory of the System Open Market Account (SOMA) portfolio. Since balance sheet runoff commenced in June 2022, SOMA securities holdings had fallen almost $2¼ trillion. As a percentage of GDP, the portfolio had declined to close to where it had been at the start of the pandemic. The corresponding drain in Federal Reserve liabilities had largely come out of balances at the ON RRP facility, while reserve levels had been relatively little changed over that period. 4 June 17-18, 2025 Respondents to the June Desk survey, on average, expected runoff to end in February of next year, a month later compared with the previous survey, with an expected size of the SOMA portfolio of $6.2 trillion, or about 20 percent of GDP. At that point, the respondents, on average, expected reserves to be at $2.9 trillion and the ON RRP balance to be low. The manager noted that, starting on June 26, the Desk will begin adding regular morning standing repo facility (SRF) operations to the existing afternoon operations. The additional operations are intended to further enhance the effectiveness of the SRF in its ability to support monetary policy implementation and smooth market functioning. By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk’s domestic transactions over the intermeeting period. There were no intervention operations in foreign currencies for the System’s account during the intermeeting period. Staff Review of the Economic Situation The information available at the time of the meeting indicated that consumer price inflation remained somewhat elevated. The unemployment rate continued to be low, and labor market conditions were solid. Available indicators suggested that real GDP was expanding at a solid pace in the second quarter. Total consumer price inflation—as measured by the 12-month change in the PCE price index—was estimated to have been 2.3 percent in May, based on the consumer and producer price indexes. Core PCE price inflation, which excludes changes in consumer energy prices and many consumer food prices, was 2.6 percent in May. Both total and core inflation were lower than at the beginning of the year. Survey-based measures of short-term inflation expectations remained high, although the extent of increases in recent months had varied considerably and some measures had declined somewhat in May and June. Most survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations had held steady. Recent data indicated that labor market conditions had remained solid. The unemployment rate was 4.2 percent in May, the same as in the previous two months. The labor force participation rate and the employment-to-population ratio moved down in May but remained near their levels since the beginning of the year. Total nonfarm payrolls increased at a solid pace in May, a little above the average monthly rate over the previous four months. The ratio of job vacancies to unemployed job seekers was unchanged at 1.0 in May. Average hourly earnings for all employees rose 3.9 percent over the 12 months ending in May, a little lower than a year earlier. Recent information suggested that real GDP was rising in the second quarter, after it had declined slightly in the previous quarter. Real private domestic final purchases—which comprises PCE and private fixed investment and which often provides a better signal than GDP of underlying economic Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee 5 momentum—had increased solidly in the first quarter and appeared to be expanding further in the second quarter. Indicators for consumer spending, such as retail sales and motor vehicle purchases through May, pointed to solid PCE growth in the second quarter. Business fixed investment (BFI) rose markedly in the first quarter, apparently boosted by a pull-forward of imported capital goods in anticipation of tariff increases, and incoming data suggested that BFI was rising modestly in the second quarter. International trade flows continued to be volatile amid substantial shifts in U.S. tariffs. After surging in the first quarter ahead of expected tariff hikes, U.S. imports—especially of consumer goods—declined sharply in April. That decline suggested that the front-loading of imports had stopped after the introduction of broad-based tariffs in early April. By contrast, U.S. exports firmed in April. In mid-May, the U.S. and China agreed to a 90-day reduction in bilateral tariffs, and recent indicators suggested that this change led to a rebound in trade flows. Economic growth abroad picked up in the first quarter, lifted by the surge in shipments to the U.S.— especially from Europe and Asia excluding China—in anticipation of tariff hikes. More recent indicators pointed to a slowdown in foreign economic activity in the second quarter, partly reflecting lower exports to the U.S. and the effects of elevated uncertainty about the course of global trade policies. Inflation abroad remained near central bank targets in many foreign economies, although recent data showed renewed inflationary pressures in some countries, notably in Mexico. By contrast, inflation in China remained subdued. Many foreign central banks eased policy during the intermeeting period, citing concerns about economic growth and, in some cases, further progress on restoring price stability. In their communications, foreign central banks continued to emphasize the need to maintain policy flexibility amid substantial risks and uncertainty. Staff Review of the Financial Situation Despite a weakening of near-term inflation pressures, the market-implied path of the federal funds rate over the next year increased over the intermeeting period with improvements in the economic outlook amid a general easing in trade tensions. Near-term inflation compensation declined, while longer-term inflation compensation was little changed. Nominal and real Treasury yields increased moderately, on net, across the maturity spectrum. Consistent with improving risk sentiment from recent trade developments, broad equity price indexes increased markedly, and credit spreads tightened. Credit spreads narrowed to very low levels relative to their historical distribution, except for the lowest-quality corporate bonds, which stood close to the 6 June 17-18, 2025 median of their distribution. The VIX—a forward-looking measure of near-term equity market volatility— declined moderately. The reduction in trade policy tensions between the U.S. and China led to an improvement in global economic growth prospects and lifted investor risk sentiment. The military conflict between Israel and Iran left only a limited imprint outside of energy markets. On net, equity indexes and market-based policy rate expectations increased in most major foreign economies. The dollar depreciated a bit further. Conditions in U.S. short-term funding markets remained stable. After increasing over the previous intermeeting period because of incoming tax receipts, the TGA had resumed its decline in response to actions associated with the ongoing federal debt limit situation. Average usage of the ON RRP facility was little changed. Rates in secured markets were, on average, slightly below the effective federal funds rate, likely reflecting low Treasury bill supply. In domestic credit markets, borrowing costs for businesses, households, and municipalities mostly edged down but remained elevated. Yields on both corporate bonds and leveraged loans declined modestly. Interest rates on small business loans decreased in May. Yields on higher-rated tranches of commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) were little changed or increased slightly, whereas yields on lower-rated CMBS tranches declined, notably so for non-agency securities. Rates on 30-year fixed-rate conforming residential mortgages were little changed and remained elevated. Interest rates on credit card offers ticked up in March and April, while rates on new auto loans were little changed in May. Financing through capital markets and nonbank lenders was readily accessible for public corporations and large and middle-market private corporations. Issuance of nonfinancial corporate bonds and leveraged loans, which slowed in April, was solid in May and early June, and private credit continued to be broadly available in April and May. Regarding bank credit, commercial and industrial loan growth picked up in April but moderated in May. Commercial real estate (CRE) loan growth was modest in April and May. Credit remained available for most households. In the residential mortgage market, credit continued to be easily available for high-credit-score borrowers but was tighter for low-credit-score borrowers despite easing slightly in May. Growth in consumer loan balances at banks was robust in April and May. Credit quality remained solid for large-to-midsize firms, municipalities, and most categories of mortgages, but delinquency rates continued to be somewhat elevated in other sectors. The credit performance of corporate bonds and leveraged loans remained stable in May. Delinquency rates on Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee 7 small business loans in March and April stayed above pre-pandemic levels. In the CRE market, CMBS delinquency rates remained elevated in May. Regarding household credit quality, the rate of serious delinquencies on Federal Housing Administration mortgages remained above pre-pandemic levels in April. By contrast, delinquency rates on most other mortgage loan types continued to stay near historical lows. In the first quarter, credit card and auto loan delinquency rates remained at elevated levels. Student loan delinquencies reported to credit bureaus shot up in the first quarter of the year after the expiration of the on-ramp period for student loan payments and were expected to climb further over the next few quarters. While delinquent student loan borrowers have not shown greater difficulty in meeting other debt payments so far, debt collections on defaulted student loans later this year could boost delinquency rates on other debt. Staff Economic Outlook The staff projection of real GDP growth for this year through 2027 was higher than the one prepared for the May meeting, primarily because trade policy announcements led the staff to reduce their assumptions about effective tariff rates relative to those in their previous forecast. With that improved economic outlook, labor market conditions were not expected to weaken as much as in the previous projection, though the unemployment rate was still forecast to rise somewhat through next year and to run a little above the staff’s estimate of its natural rate through 2027. The staff’s inflation projection was lower than the one prepared for the May meeting. Tariff increases were expected to raise inflation this year and to provide a small boost in 2026. Inflation was projected to decline to 2 percent by 2027. The staff continued to view the uncertainty around their economic outlook as elevated, primarily reflecting the uncertainty surrounding changes to trade, fiscal, immigration, and regulatory policies and the associated economic effects. In addition to the baseline forecast, the staff had prepared a number of alternative economic scenarios. The staff judged the risks around the projections of real GDP growth and employment as still skewed to the downside, though they saw the risk of a recession as less than at the time of their previous forecast. The staff continued to view the risks around the inflation forecast as skewed to the upside, as the projected rise in inflation this year could be more persistent than assumed in the baseline projection. Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, participants submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation for each year from 2025 through 2027 and over the longer run. The projections were based on participants’ individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy, including their projections of the federal funds rate. The longer-run 8 June 17-18, 2025 projections represented each participant’s assessment of the rate to which each variable would tend to converge under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy. Participants also provided their individual assessments of the level of uncertainty and the balance of risks associated with their projections. The SEP was released to the public after the meeting. Participants noted that the available data showed that economic growth was solid and the unemployment rate was low. Participants observed that inflation had come down but remained somewhat elevated. Growth in consumer spending and business investment had been solid, though many participants observed that measures of household and business sentiment remained weak. Participants judged that uncertainty about the outlook was elevated amid evolving developments in trade policy, other government policies, and geopolitical risks, but that overall uncertainty had diminished since the previous meeting. Some participants commented that high uncertainty had the potential to restrain economic activity, including private-sector hiring, in the near term. Participants judged that there were downside risks to employment and economic activity and upside risks to inflation, but that these risks had decreased as expectations about effective tariff rates and their effects had declined from levels in April. Participants observed that inflation had eased significantly since its peak in 2022 but remained somewhat elevated relative to the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run goal. Participants noted that the progress in returning inflation to target had continued even though that progress had been uneven. Some participants observed that services price inflation had moved down recently, while goods price inflation had risen. A few participants noted that there had been limited progress recently in reducing core inflation. Some participants noted that geopolitical developments in the Middle East posed an upside risk to energy prices. In discussing their outlooks for inflation, participants noted that increased tariffs were likely to put upward pressure on prices. There was considerable uncertainty, however, about the timing, size, and duration of these effects. Many observed that it might take some time for the effect of higher tariffs to be reflected in the prices of final goods because firms might choose not to raise prices on affected goods and services until they had run down inventories of products imported before the increase in tariffs or because it would take some time for tariffs on intermediate goods to work through the supply chain. Several participants commented that upward pressure on prices could be greater if tariffs disrupted supply chains or acted as a drag on productivity. Many participants noted that the eventual effect of tariffs on inflation could be more limited if trade deals are reached soon, if firms are able to quickly adjust their supply chains, or if firms can use other margins of adjustment to reduce their exposure to the effects of tariffs. Several participants noted that firms not directly subject to tariffs might take the opportunity to increase their prices if other prices rise, particularly those of complementary products. Participants relayed a range of assessments from their business contacts Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee 9 regarding the extent to which tariff-related cost increases would be passed on to consumers. Several participants observed that the pass-through of tariffs might be limited if households and businesses exhibit a low tolerance for price hikes or if firms seek to increase their market share as others raise their prices. A few participants noted that the pass-through of tariff-related costs likely would be greater for smaller businesses or businesses with narrow profit margins. Participants noted that longer-term inflation expectations continued to be well anchored and that it was important they remain so. Several participants commented that shorter-term inflation expectations had been elevated and that this development had the potential to spill over into longer- term expectations or to affect price and wage setting in the near term. While a few participants noted that tariffs would lead to a one-time increase in prices and would not affect longer-term inflation expectations, most participants noted the risk that tariffs could have more persistent effects on inflation, and some highlighted the fact that such persistence could also affect inflation expectations. Some participants observed that because inflation has been elevated for some time, there was a heightened risk of longer-term inflation expectations becoming unanchored if there is a long-lasting rise in inflation. In their discussion of the labor market, participants judged that conditions remained solid and that the labor market was at, or near, estimates of maximum employment. Several participants observed that the recent stability of the labor market reflected a slowing in both hiring and layoffs, and several participants also mentioned that their contacts and business survey respondents reported pausing hiring decisions because of elevated uncertainty. Several participants noted that immigration policies were reducing labor supply. In their outlook for the labor market, most participants suggested that higher tariffs or heightened policy uncertainty would weigh on labor demand, and many participants expected a gradual softening of conditions. A few participants noted that some indicators already provided signs of softness and that they would be attentive to indications of further labor market weakening. Some participants observed that wage growth had continued to moderate and that it was not expected to contribute to inflationary pressures. Participants judged that economic activity had continued to grow at a solid pace, although uncertainty remained elevated. The outlook was for continued economic growth, although a majority of participants expected that the pace of growth was likely to moderate going forward. Regarding the household sector, several participants observed that some recent data indicated continued solid consumer spending growth, whereas several other participants pointed to other data that suggested softening. Several participants noted that lower- and moderate-income households were switching to lower-cost items and brands or that these households could be disproportionately affected by tariff- related price increases. Many participants observed that measures of household sentiment remained 10 June 17-18, 2025 low, although these measures had risen a bit recently. A few participants noted that consumer sentiment had not been a good predictor of consumer spending in recent years. In their discussion of the business sector, participants noted that activity remained solid, although there have been signs of softening, and many observed that indicators of business sentiment remained low. With respect to investment spending, several participants reported that business contacts had indicated that their firms were proceeding with existing investment projects but that heightened uncertainty was making them cautious about beginning new projects, especially larger ones; some smaller new investments or those with more certain payoffs were still being undertaken. Several participants noted that financing from both banks and financial markets was readily available for larger investment projects. A couple of participants noted that business investment in artificial intelligence could boost productivity. Several participants commented that there had been signs of softening production activity in the manufacturing sector and pointed to reductions in orders and shipments in manufacturing surveys or in reports of business contacts. A couple of participants noted that the agricultural sector faced strains from low crop prices and high input costs. In their consideration of monetary policy at this meeting, participants noted that inflation remained somewhat elevated. Participants also observed that recent indicators suggested that economic activity had continued to expand at a solid pace, although swings in net exports and inventories had affected the measurement and interpretation of the data. Participants further noted that the unemployment rate remained at a low level and that labor market conditions had remained solid. Participants observed that uncertainty about the economic outlook had diminished amid a reduction in announced and expected tariffs, which appeared to peak in April and had subsequently declined, but that overall uncertainty continued to be elevated. All participants viewed it as appropriate to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 4¼ to 4½ percent. Participants judged it appropriate to continue the process of reducing the Federal Reserve’s securities holdings. In considering the outlook for monetary policy, participants generally agreed that, with economic growth and the labor market still solid and current monetary policy moderately or modestly restrictive, the Committee was well positioned to wait for more clarity on the outlook for inflation and economic activity. Participants noted that monetary policy would be informed by a wide range of incoming data, the economic outlook, and the balance of risks. Most participants assessed that some reduction in the target range for the federal funds rate this year would likely be appropriate, noting that upward pressure on inflation from tariffs may be temporary or modest, that medium- and longer-term inflation expectations had remained well anchored, or that some weakening of economic activity and labor market conditions could occur. A couple of participants noted that, if the data evolve in line with their expectations, they would be open to considering a reduction in the target range for the policy rate as soon as at the next meeting. Some participants saw the most likely appropriate path of monetary Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee 11 policy as involving no reductions in the target range for the federal funds rate this year, noting that recent inflation readings had continued to exceed the Committee’s 2 percent goal, that upside risks to inflation remained meaningful in light of factors such as elevated short-term inflation expectations of businesses and households, or that they expected that the economy would remain resilient. Several participants commented that the current target range for the federal funds rate may not be far above its neutral level. Various participants discussed risks that, if realized, would have the potential to affect the appropriate path of monetary policy. Regarding upside risks to inflation, participants noted that, if the imposition of tariffs were to generate a larger-than-expected increase in inflation, if such an increase in inflation were to be more persistent than anticipated, or if a notable increase in medium- or longer-term inflation expectations were to occur, then it would be appropriate to maintain a more restrictive stance of monetary policy than would otherwise be the case, especially if labor market conditions and economic activity remained solid. By contrast, if labor market conditions or economic activity were to weaken materially, or if inflation were to continue to come down and inflation expectations remained well anchored, then it would be appropriate to establish a less restrictive stance of monetary policy than would otherwise be the case. Participants noted that the Committee might face difficult tradeoffs if elevated inflation proved to be more persistent while the outlook for employment weakened. If that were to occur, participants agreed that they would consider how far the economy is from each goal and the potentially different time horizons over which those respective gaps would be anticipated to close. In considering the likelihood of various scenarios, participants agreed that the risks of higher inflation and weaker labor market conditions had diminished but remained elevated, citing a lower expected path of tariffs, encouraging recent readings on inflation and inflation expectations, resilience in consumer and business spending, or improvements in some measures of consumer or business sentiment. Some participants commented that they saw the risk of elevated inflation as remaining more prominent, or as having diminished by less, than risks to employment. A few participants saw risks to the labor market as having become predominant. They noted some recent signs of weakening in real activity or the labor market, or commented that conditions could weaken in the future, particularly if policy were to remain restrictive. Participants agreed that although uncertainty about inflation and the economic outlook had decreased, it remained appropriate to take a careful approach in adjusting monetary policy. Participants emphasized the importance of ensuring that longer-term inflation expectations remained well anchored and agreed that the current stance of monetary policy positioned the Committee well to respond in a timely way to potential economic developments. 12 June 17-18, 2025 Committee Policy Actions In their discussions of monetary policy for this meeting, members agreed that although swings in net exports had affected the data, recent indicators suggested that economic activity had continued to expand at a solid pace. Members agreed that the unemployment rate had remained at a low level and that labor market conditions had remained solid. Members concurred that inflation remained somewhat elevated. Members agreed that it was appropriate to acknowledge in the postmeeting statement that uncertainty about the economic outlook had diminished but remained elevated, and the Committee was attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate. The assessment that uncertainty had declined reflected, in part, a reduction in the expected level of tariffs, which appeared to peak in April and had subsequently declined. In support of its goals, the Committee agreed to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 4¼ to 4½ percent. Members agreed that, in considering the extent and timing of additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee would carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. All members agreed that the postmeeting statement should affirm their strong commitment both to supporting maximum employment and to returning inflation to the Committee’s 2 percent objective. Members agreed that, in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee would continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. They would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerged that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals. Members also agreed that their assessments would take into account a wide range of information, including readings on labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the following domestic policy directive, for release at 2:00 p.m.: “Effective June 20, 2025, the Federal Open Market Committee directs the Desk to: • Undertake open market operations as necessary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of 4¼ to 4½ percent. • Conduct standing overnight repurchase agreement operations with a minimum bid rate of 4.5 percent and with an aggregate operation limit of $500 billion. • Conduct standing overnight reverse repurchase agreement operations at an offering rate of 4.25 percent and with a per-counterparty limit of $160 billion per day. Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee 13 • Roll over at auction the amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of Treasury securities maturing in each calendar month that exceeds a cap of $5 billion per month. Redeem Treasury coupon securities up to this monthly cap and Treasury bills to the extent that coupon principal payments are less than the monthly cap. • Reinvest the amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) received in each calendar month that exceeds a cap of $35 billion per month into Treasury securities to roughly match the maturity composition of Treasury securities outstanding. • Allow modest deviations from stated amounts for reinvestments, if needed for operational reasons.” The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below for release at 2:00 p.m.: “Although swings in net exports have affected the data, recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace. The unemployment rate remains low, and labor market conditions remain solid. Inflation remains somewhat elevated. The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. Uncertainty about the economic outlook has diminished but remains elevated. The Committee is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate. In support of its goals, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 4¼ to 4½ percent. In considering the extent and timing of additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. The Committee will continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage‑backed securities. The Committee is strongly committed to supporting maximum employment and returning inflation to its 2 percent objective. In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals. The Committee’s assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.” 14 June 17-18, 2025 Voting for this action: Jerome H. Powell, John C. Williams, Michael S. Barr, Michelle W. Bowman, Susan M. Collins, Lisa D. Cook, Austan D. Goolsbee, Philip N. Jefferson, Adriana D. Kugler, Alberto G. Musalem, Jeffrey R. Schmid, and Christopher J. Waller. Voting against this action: None. Consistent with the Committee’s decision to leave the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted unanimously to maintain the interest rate paid on reserve balances at 4.4 percent, effective June 20, 2025. The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted unanimously to approve the establishment of the primary credit rate at the existing level of 4.5 percent. It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Tuesday–Wednesday, July 29– 30, 2025. The meeting adjourned at 10:10 a.m. on June 18, 2025. Notation Vote By notation vote completed on May 27, 2025, the Committee unanimously approved the minutes of the Committee meeting held on May 6–7, 2025. Attendance Jerome H. Powell, Chair John C.

They observed that they had made important progress toward revising the Committee’s Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy (consensus statement). Participants discussed potential revisions to the consensus statement that would incorporate lessons learned from economic developments since the 2020 framework review and would be designed to be robust across a wide range of economic conditions. Participants noted that the Committee was close to finalizing changes to the consensus statement and would do so in the near future. Developments in Financial Markets and Open Market Operations The manager turned first to a review of financial market developments. Over the intermeeting period, the expected path of the policy rate and longer-term Treasury yields were little changed, equity prices increased, credit spreads narrowed, and the dollar depreciated slightly. The manager noted that markets continued to be attentive to news related to trade policy, though markets’ reaction to incoming information on this topic was more restrained than in April and May. Against this backdrop, the manager reported that the Open Market Desk’s Survey of Market Expectations (Desk survey) indicated that the median respondent’s expectations regarding both real gross domestic product (GDP) growth and inflation were roughly unchanged. The manager turned next to policy rate expectations, which held steady over the intermeeting period, consistent with a relatively stable macroeconomic outlook. The median modal path of the federal funds rate, as given in the Desk survey, was unchanged from the corresponding path in the June 1 The Federal Open Market Committee is referenced as the “FOMC” and the “Committee” in these minutes; the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System is referenced as the “Board” in these minutes. 2 July 29–30, 2025 survey and continued to indicate expectations of two 25 basis point rate cuts in the second half of this year. Market-based measures of policy rate expectations were also little changed and indicated expectations of one to two 25 basis point rate cuts by the end of the year. The manager then discussed developments in Treasury securities markets and market-based measures of inflation compensation. Nominal Treasury yields were little changed, on net, over the intermeeting period, consistent with the lack of appreciable changes in the macroeconomic outlook and in policy rate expectations. Perceived risks associated with trade policy developments contributed to an increase in near-term market measures of inflation compensation, while longer-horizon measures of inflation compensation rose more modestly. The manager then turned to market pricing of risky assets. The increases in equity prices and narrowing of credit spreads suggested that markets assessed that the overall U.S. economy was remaining resilient; still, financial markets appeared to be making distinctions between individual corporations on the basis of the size and quality of their earnings. Valuations of the S&P 500 index continued to move above long-run average levels, mostly driven by optimism about the largest technology firms’ scope to benefit from the further adoption of artificial intelligence (AI). However, valuations of an index of smaller-capitalization firms, although higher over the intermeeting period, remained below their historical averages. Regarding foreign exchange developments, the manager noted that the broad trade-weighted dollar index had continued to depreciate since the previous FOMC meeting but at a slower pace than in recent intermeeting periods. At the same time, the manager noted that correlations between the dollar and its fundamental drivers had normalized recently. The available data continued to suggest relative stability in foreign holdings of U.S. assets. The manager turned next to money markets. Unsecured overnight rates remained stable over the intermeeting period. Rates on Treasury repurchase agreements (repo) were somewhat higher than the low levels seen in the previous intermeeting period. The manager observed that two factors contributed to this slight increase: the normal upward pressure on money market rates associated with the June quarter-end; and the rise in net Treasury bill issuance amid the rebuilding of the Treasury General Account (TGA) balance following the increase in the debt limit in early July. On June 30, as market rates climbed modestly above the standing repo facility’s (SRF) minimum bid rate at quarter-end, there was material usage of the facility, with counterparties borrowing a bit more than $11 billion, the highest utilization to date. The manager also discussed the projected trajectory of various Federal Reserve liabilities. With increased Treasury bill issuance associated with the rebuilding of the TGA balance likely to result in a rise in money market rates, take-up at the overnight reverse repurchase agreement (ON RRP) facility Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee 3 was expected to decline to low levels relatively soon. Market indicators continued to suggest that reserves remained abundant; however, ongoing System Open Market Account (SOMA) portfolio runoff, a substantial expected increase in the TGA balance, and the depletion of the ON RRP facility were together likely to bring about a sustained decline in reserves for the first time since portfolio runoff started in June 2022. Against this backdrop, the staff would continue to monitor indicators of reserve conditions closely. The manager also noted that there would be times—such as quarter-ends, tax dates, and days associated with large settlements of Treasury securities—when reserves were likely to dip temporarily to even lower levels. At those times, utilization of the SRF would likely support the smooth functioning of money markets and the implementation of monetary policy. By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk’s domestic transactions over the intermeeting period. There were no intervention operations in foreign currencies for the System’s account during the intermeeting period. Staff Review of the Economic Situation The information available at the time of the meeting indicated that real GDP expanded at a tepid pace in the first half of the year. The unemployment rate continued to be low, and consumer price inflation remained somewhat elevated. Disinflation appeared to have stalled, with tariffs putting upward pressure on goods price inflation. Total consumer price inflation—as measured by the 12-month change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE)—was estimated to have been 2.5 percent in June, based on the consumer and producer price indexes. Core PCE price inflation, which excludes changes in consumer energy prices and many consumer food prices, was estimated to have been 2.7 percent in June. Both inflation rates were similar to their year-earlier levels. Recent data indicated that labor market conditions remained solid. The unemployment rate was 4.1 percent in June, down 0.1 percentage point from May. The participation rate edged down 0.1 percentage point in June, and the employment-to-population ratio was unchanged. Total nonfarm payroll gains were solid in June, though the pace of private payroll gains stepped down noticeably. The ratio of job vacancies to unemployed workers was 1.1 in June and remained within the narrow range seen over the past year. Average hourly earnings for all employees rose 3.7 percent over the 12 months ending in June, slightly lower than the year-earlier pace. According to the advance estimate, real GDP rose in the second quarter after declining in the first quarter. Growth of real private domestic final purchases—which comprises PCE and private fixed investment and which often provides a better signal than GDP of underlying economic momentum— slowed in the second quarter, as a step-down in investment growth offset faster PCE growth. 4 July 29–30, 2025 After exerting a substantial negative drag on GDP growth in the first quarter, net exports made a large positive contribution in the second quarter. Real imports of goods and services declined sharply, likely reflecting the aftereffects of the substantial front-loading of imports recorded in the first quarter ahead of anticipated tariff hikes. By contrast, exports of goods declined at a more moderate pace, and exports of services rose further. Abroad, activity indicators pointed to a slowdown of foreign economic growth in the second quarter, as the transitory boost due to the front-loading of U.S. imports earlier in the year faded. Of note, monthly GDP data through May indicated that economic activity contracted in Canada. China’s GDP, however, continued to expand at a moderate pace in the second quarter, supported by solid domestic spending. Headline inflation rates were near targets in most foreign economies, held down by past declines in oil prices and fading wage pressures following a tightening in monetary policy stances over the past few years. However, core inflation remained somewhat elevated in some foreign economies. Over the intermeeting period, several foreign central banks, such as the Bank of Mexico and the Swiss National Bank, further eased their monetary policy stance, while others, such as the Bank of England and the European Central Bank, held their policy rates steady. In their communications, foreign central banks continued to emphasize that U.S. trade policies and accompanying uncertainty have started to weigh on economic activity in their economies. Staff Review of the Financial Situation Over the intermeeting period, both the market-implied expected path of the federal funds rate over the next year and nominal Treasury yields were little changed, on net, while real yields declined. Inflation compensation rose across the maturity spectrum—particularly at shorter horizons—reflecting, at least in part, perceived risks associated with trade policy developments. Broad equity price indexes increased and credit spreads tightened, consistent with improving risk sentiment attributed in part to easing geopolitical tensions as well as stronger-than-expected economic activity. Credit spreads for all rating categories except the lowest-quality bonds narrowed to exceptionally low levels relative to their historical distribution. The VIX—a forward-looking measure of near-term equity market volatility—declined moderately to just below the median of its historical distribution. Over the intermeeting period, news about trade policy interpreted as positive by investors together with some easing of geopolitical tensions in the Middle East led to moderate increases in foreign equity prices and longer-term yields. The broad dollar index was little changed on net. Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee 5 Conditions in U.S. short-term funding markets remained orderly over the intermeeting period while displaying typical quarter-end dynamics. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which became law on July 4, ended the previous debt issuance suspension period, after which the TGA balance increased from $313 billion on July 3 to an expected $500 billion by the end of July. Rates in secured markets were, on average, somewhat elevated relative to the average over the previous intermeeting period, owing in part to quarter-end effects. Although upward pressure on repo rates was modest at quarter-end, take- up at the SRF was $11.1 billion on June 30—its highest level since the inception of the facility—as the addition of an early settlement option seemed to encourage participation. Average usage of the ON RRP facility was little changed over the intermeeting period. In domestic credit markets, borrowing costs facing businesses, households, and municipalities eased moderately but remained elevated relative to post-Global Financial Crisis (GFC) average levels. Yields on both corporate bonds and leveraged loans declined modestly, while interest rates on small business loans were little changed on net. Rates on 30-year fixed-rate conforming residential mortgages were little changed and remained near the top of the post-GFC historical distribution. Interest rates on new auto loans and for new credit card offers have fluctuated in a narrow range in recent months around the upper end of their post-GFC distributions. Credit remained generally available. Financing through capital markets and nonbank lenders was readily accessible for public corporations as well as large and middle-market private corporations. Issuance of nonfinancial corporate bonds and leveraged loans was solid in June, and private credit continued to be broadly available despite ebbing somewhat in May and June. Loan balances on banks’ books increased at a moderate pace in the second quarter, led by growth in commercial and industrial (C&I) loans. Lending to small businesses remained subdued, an outcome attributed to weak borrower demand. Banks in the July Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices reported that, on net, underwriting standards were little changed in the second quarter across most loan categories, although the level of standards remained on the tighter end of their historical range. C&I loan standards, however, were reported to be a little easier than the range seen since 2005, yet still somewhat tighter than in periods not associated with financial stress. Consumer credit continued to be readily available for high-credit-score borrowers, though growth in applications for home purchases, refinances, auto loans, and revolving credit was relatively weak, reflecting heightened borrowing costs and tighter credit standards for lower-credit-score borrowers. In the second quarter, credit performance was generally stable but somewhat weaker than pre- pandemic levels. Corporate bond and leveraged loan credit performance declined moderately in May and June, though defaults remained below post-GFC medians through June. In the commercial real 6 July 29–30, 2025 estate market, delinquency rates on commercial mortgage-backed securities remained elevated through June. The rate of serious delinquencies on Federal Housing Administration mortgages continued to be elevated. By contrast, delinquency rates on most other mortgage loan types continued to stay near historical lows. In May, the credit card delinquency rate was a little below its year-earlier value, while that for auto loans was roughly the same as in May last year; both were elevated relative to their pre-pandemic levels. Student loan delinquencies reported to credit bureaus shot up in the first quarter of the year after the expiration of the on-ramp period for student loan payments. The staff provided an updated assessment of the stability of the U.S. financial system and, on balance, continued to characterize the system’s financial vulnerabilities as notable. The staff judged that asset valuation pressures were elevated. In equity markets, price-to-earnings ratios stood at the upper end of their historical distribution, while spreads on high-yield corporate bonds narrowed notably and were low relative to their historical distribution. Housing valuations edged down but remained elevated. Vulnerabilities associated with nonfinancial business and household debt were characterized as moderate. Household debt to GDP was at its lowest level in the past 20 years, and household balance sheets remained strong. The ability of publicly traded firms to service their debt remained solid. For private firms, debt grew at a rapid pace, while these firms’ interest coverage ratios declined to the lower range of their historical distributions, suggesting that vulnerabilities may be growing in that sector. Vulnerabilities associated with leverage in the financial sector were characterized as notable. Regulatory capital ratios in the banking sector remained high, while recent annual supervisory stress- test results showed that all participants stayed above minimum capital requirements even under stress conditions. Banks, however, were still seen as more exposed to interest rate risk than had been historically typical, albeit to a lesser degree than was the case earlier in the decade. In the nonbank sector, life insurers’ allocation of assets toward private credit and risky assets, funded in part by nontraditional liabilities with short maturities, continued to grow. Leverage and rollover risk at hedge funds remained high and concentrated in the largest firms. Vulnerabilities associated with funding risks were characterized as moderate. Money market funds (MMFs) continued to be vulnerable to runs, though the aggregate assets of such prime and prime-like investment vehicles remained in the middle of their historical range as a fraction of GDP. Prime-like alternatives—including private liquidity funds, offshore MMFs, and stablecoins—have grown rapidly and were noted as relatively less transparent. Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee 7 Staff Economic Outlook The staff’s real GDP growth projection for this year through 2027 was similar to the one prepared for the June meeting, reflecting the offsetting effects of several revisions to the outlook. The staff expected that the rise in the cost of imported goods inclusive of tariffs would be smaller and occur later than in their previous forecast; in addition, financial conditions were projected to be slightly more supportive of output growth. However, these positive influences on the outlook were offset by weaker- than-expected spending data and a smaller assumed population boost from net immigration. The staff continued to expect that the labor market would weaken, with the unemployment rate projected to move above the staff’s estimate of its natural rate around the end of this year and to remain above the natural rate through 2027. The staff’s inflation projection was slightly lower than the one prepared for the June meeting, reflecting the downward revision to the assumed effects of tariffs on imported goods prices. Tariffs were expected to raise inflation this year and to provide some further upward pressure on inflation in 2026; inflation was then projected to decline to 2 percent by 2027. The staff continued to view the uncertainty around the projection as elevated, primarily reflecting uncertainty regarding changes to economic policies, including trade policy, and their associated economic effects. Risks to real activity were judged to remain skewed to the downside in light of the weakening in GDP growth seen so far this year and elevated policy uncertainty. The staff continued to view the risks around the inflation forecast as skewed to the upside, as the projected rise in inflation this year could prove to be more persistent than assumed in the baseline projection. Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook In their discussion of inflation, many participants observed that overall inflation remained somewhat above the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run goal. Participants noted that tariff effects were becoming more apparent in the data, as indicated by recent increases in goods price inflation, while services price inflation had continued to slow. A couple of participants suggested that tariff effects were masking the underlying trend of inflation and, setting aside the tariff effects, inflation was close to target. With regard to the outlook for inflation, participants generally expected inflation to increase in the near term. Participants judged that considerable uncertainty remained about the timing, magnitude, and persistence of the effects of this year’s increase in tariffs. In terms of timing, many participants noted that it could take some time for the full effects of higher tariffs to be felt in consumer goods and services prices. Participants cited several contributors to this likely lag. These included the stockpiling of inventories in anticipation of higher tariffs; slow pass-through of input cost increases into 8 July 29–30, 2025 final goods and services prices; gradual updating of contract prices; maintenance of firm–customer relationships; issues related to tariff collection; and still-ongoing trade negotiations. As for the magnitude of tariff effects on prices, a few participants observed that evidence so far suggested that foreign exporters were paying at most a modest part of the increased tariffs, implying that domestic businesses and consumers were predominantly bearing the tariff costs. Several participants, drawing on information provided by business contacts or business surveys, expected that many companies would increasingly have to pass through tariff costs to end-customers over time. However, a few participants reported that business contacts and survey respondents described a mix of strategies as being undertaken to avoid fully passing on tariff costs to customers. Such strategies included negotiating with or switching suppliers, changing production processes, lowering profit margins, exerting more wage discipline, or exploiting cost-saving efficiency measures such as automation and new technologies. A few participants stressed that current demand conditions were limiting firms’ ability to pass tariff costs into prices. Regarding inflation persistence, a few participants emphasized that they expected higher tariffs to lead only to a one-time increase in the price level that would be realized over a reasonably contained period. A few participants remarked that tariff-related factors, including supply chain disruptions, could lead to stubbornly elevated inflation and that it may be difficult to disentangle tariff-related price increases from changes in underlying trend inflation. Participants noted that longer-term inflation expectations continued to be well anchored and that it was important that they remain so. Several participants emphasized that inflation had exceeded 2 percent for an extended period and that this experience increased the risk of longer-term inflation expectations becoming unanchored in the event of drawn-out effects of higher tariffs on inflation. A couple of participants noted that inflation expectations would likely be influenced by the behavior of the overall inflation rate, inclusive of the effects of tariffs. Various participants emphasized the central role of monetary policy in ensuring that tariff effects did not lead to persistently higher expected and realized inflation. In their discussion of the labor market, participants observed that the unemployment rate remained low and that employment was at or near estimates of maximum employment. Several participants noted that the low and stable unemployment rate reflected a combination of low hiring and low layoffs. Some participants observed that their contacts and business survey respondents had reported being reluctant to hire or fire amid elevated uncertainty. Regarding the outlook for the labor market, some participants mentioned indicators that could suggest a softening in labor demand. These included slower and more concentrated job growth, an increase in cyclically sensitive Black and youth unemployment rates, and lower wage increases of job switchers than job stayers. Some of these participants also noted anecdotes in the Beige Book or in their discussions with contacts that pointed to slower demand. Furthermore, a number of participants noted that softness in aggregate Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee 9 demand and economic activity may translate into weaker labor market conditions, as could a potential inability of some importers to withstand higher tariffs. Some participants remarked, however, that slower output or employment growth was not necessarily indicative of emerging economic slack because a decline in immigration was lowering both actual and potential output growth as well as reducing both actual payroll growth and the number of new jobs needed to keep the unemployment rate stable. A few participants relayed reports received from contacts that immigration policies were affecting labor supply in some sectors, including construction and agriculture. Participants observed that growth of economic activity slowed in the first half of the year, driven in large part by slower consumption growth and a decline in residential investment. Several participants stated that they expected growth in economic activity to remain low in the second half of this year. Some participants noted that economic activity would nevertheless be supported by financial conditions, including elevated household net worth, and a couple of participants highlighted stable or low credit card delinquencies. A couple of participants remarked that economic activity would be supported by the resolution of policy uncertainty over time. Regarding the household sector, several participants observed that slower real income growth may be weighing on growth in consumer spending. A few participants noted a weakening in housing demand, with increased availability of homes for sale and falling house prices. As for businesses, several participants remarked that ongoing policy uncertainty had continued to slow business investment, but several observed that business sentiment had improved in recent months. A few participants commented that the agricultural sector faced headwinds due to low crop prices. In their evaluation of the risks and uncertainties associated with the economic outlook, participants judged that uncertainty about the economic outlook remained elevated, though several participants remarked that there had been some reduction in uncertainty regarding fiscal policy, immigration policy, or tariff policy. Participants generally pointed to risks to both sides of the Committee’s dual mandate, emphasizing upside risk to inflation and downside risk to employment. A majority of participants judged the upside risk to inflation as the greater of these two risks, while several participants viewed the two risks as roughly balanced, and a couple of participants considered downside risk to employment the more salient risk. Regarding upside risks to inflation, participants pointed to the uncertain effects of tariffs and the possibility of inflation expectations becoming unanchored. In addition to tariff-induced risks, potential downside risks to employment mentioned by participants included a possible tightening of financial conditions due to a rise in risk premiums, a more substantial deterioration in the housing market, and the risk that the increased use of AI in the workplace may lower employment. In their discussion of financial stability, participants who commented noted vulnerabilities to the financial system that they assessed warranted monitoring. Several participants noted concerns about 10 July 29–30, 2025 elevated asset valuation pressures. Regarding banks, a couple of participants commented that, though regulatory capital levels remained strong, some banks continued to be vulnerable to a rise in longer-term yields and the associated unrealized losses on bank assets. A few participants commented on vulnerabilities in the market for Treasury securities, raising concerns about dealer intermediation capacity, the increasing presence of hedge funds in the market, and the fragility associated with low market depth. A couple of participants discussed foreign exchange swaps, noting that these served as key sources of dollar funding for foreign financial institutions that lend dollars to their customers in the U.S. and abroad, but also that they entailed vulnerabilities due to maturity mismatch and rollover risk. Many participants discussed recent and prospective developments related to payment stablecoins and possible implications for the financial system. These participants noted that use of payment stablecoins might grow following the recent passage of the GENIUS Act (Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act). They remarked that payment stablecoins could help improve the efficiency of the payment system. They also observed that such stablecoins could increase the demand for the assets needed to back them, including Treasury securities. In addition, participants who commented raised concerns that stablecoins could have broader implications for the banking and financial systems as well as monetary policy implementation, and thus warranted close attention, including monitoring of the various assets used to back stablecoins. In their consideration of monetary policy at this meeting, participants noted that inflation remained somewhat elevated. Participants also observed that recent indicators suggested that the growth of economic activity had moderated in the first half of the year, although swings in net exports and inventories had affected the measurement and interpretation of the data. Participants further noted that the unemployment rate remained at a low level and that the labor market was at or near maximum employment. Participants judged that uncertainty about the economic outlook remained elevated. Almost all participants viewed it as appropriate to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 4¼ to 4½ percent at this meeting. All participants judged it appropriate to continue the process of reducing the Federal Reserve’s securities holdings. In considering the outlook for monetary policy, almost all participants agreed that, with the labor market still solid and current monetary policy moderately or modestly restrictive, the Committee was well positioned to respond in a timely way to potential economic developments. Participants agreed that monetary policy would be informed by a wide range of incoming data, the economic outlook, and the balance of risks. Participants assessed that the effects of higher tariffs had become more apparent in the prices of some goods but that their overall effects on economic activity and inflation remained to be seen. They also noted that it would take time to have more clarity on the magnitude and persistence of higher tariffs’ effects on inflation. Even so, some participants emphasized that a Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee 11 great deal could be learned in coming months from incoming data, helping to inform their assessment of the balance of risks and the appropriate setting of the federal funds rate; at the same time, some noted that it would not be feasible or appropriate to wait for complete clarity on the tariffs’ effects on inflation before adjusting the stance of monetary policy. Some participants stressed that the issue of the persistence of tariff effects on inflation would depend importantly on the stance of monetary policy. Several participants commented that the current target range for the federal funds rate may not be far above its neutral level; among the considerations cited in support of this assessment was the likelihood that broader financial conditions were either neutral or supportive of stronger economic activity. In discussing risk-management considerations that could bear on the outlook for monetary policy, participants generally agreed that the upside risk to inflation and the downside risk to employment remained elevated. Participants noted that, if this year’s higher tariffs were to generate a larger-than- expected or a more-persistent-than-anticipated increase in inflation, or if medium- or longer-term inflation expectations were to increase notably, then it would be appropriate to maintain a more restrictive stance of monetary policy than would otherwise be the case, especially if labor market conditions remained solid. By contrast, if labor market conditions were to weaken materially or if inflation were to come down further and inflation expectations remained well anchored, then it would be appropriate to establish a less restrictive stance of monetary policy than would otherwise be the case. Participants noted that the Committee might face difficult tradeoffs if elevated inflation proved to be more persistent while the outlook for the labor market weakened. Participants agreed that, if that situation were to occur, they would consider each variable’s distance from the Committee’s goal and the potentially different time horizons over which those respective gaps would be anticipated to close. Participants noted that, in this context, it was especially important to ensure that longer-term inflation expectations remained well anchored. Several participants remarked on issues related to the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet. Of those who commented, participants observed that balance sheet reduction had been proceeding smoothly thus far and that various indicators pointed to reserves being abundant. They agreed that, with reserves projected to decline amid the rebuilding of the TGA balance following the resolution of the debt limit situation, it was important to monitor money market conditions closely and to continue to evaluate how close reserves were to their ample level. A few participants also assessed that, in this environment, abrupt further declines in reserves could occur on key reporting and payment flow days. They noted that, if such events created pressures in money markets, the Federal Reserve’s existing tools would help supply additional reserves and keep the effective federal funds rate within the target range. A couple of participants highlighted the role of the SRF in monetary policy implementation—as 12 July 29–30, 2025 reflected in increased usage at the June quarter-end—and expressed support for further study of the possibility of central clearing of the SRF to enhance its effectiveness. Committee Policy Actions In their discussions of monetary policy for this meeting, members agreed that although swings in net exports had affected the data, recent indicators suggested that the growth of economic activity had moderated in the first half of the year. Members agreed that the unemployment rate had remained at a low level and that labor market conditions had remained solid. Members concurred that inflation remained somewhat elevated. Members agreed that uncertainty about the economic outlook remained elevated and that the Committee was attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate. In support of the Committee’s goals, almost all members agreed to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 4¼ to 4½ percent. A couple of members preferred to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points at this meeting. These members judged that, excluding tariff effects, inflation was running close to the Committee’s 2 percent objective and that higher tariffs were unlikely to have persistent effects on inflation. Furthermore, they assessed that downside risk to employment had meaningfully increased with the slowing of the growth of economic activity and consumer spending, and that some incoming data pointed to a weakening of labor market conditions, including low levels of private payroll gains and the concentration of payroll gains in a narrow set of industries that were less affected by the business cycle. Members agreed that in considering the extent and timing of additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee would carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. All members agreed that the postmeeting statement should affirm their strong commitment both to supporting maximum employment and to returning inflation to the Committee’s 2 percent objective. Members agreed that, in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee would continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. They would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerged that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals. Members also agreed that their assessments would take into account a wide range of information, including readings on labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the following domestic policy directive, for release at 2:00 p.m.: Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee 13 “Effective July 31, 2025, the Federal Open Market Committee directs the Desk to: • Undertake open market operations as necessary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of 4¼ to 4½ percent. • Conduct standing overnight repurchase agreement operations with a minimum bid rate of 4.5 percent and with an aggregate operation limit of $500 billion. • Conduct standing overnight reverse repurchase agreement operations at an offering rate of 4.25 percent and with a per-counterparty limit of $160 billion per day. • Roll over at auction the amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of Treasury securities maturing in each calendar month that exceeds a cap of $5 billion per month. Redeem Treasury coupon securities up to this monthly cap and Treasury bills to the extent that coupon principal payments are less than the monthly cap. • Reinvest the amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) received in each calendar month that exceeds a cap of $35 billion per month into Treasury securities to roughly match the maturity composition of Treasury securities outstanding. • Allow modest deviations from stated amounts for reinvestments, if needed for operational reasons.” The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below for release at 2:00 p.m.: “Although swings in net exports continue to affect the data, recent indicators suggest that growth of economic activity moderated in the first half of the year. The unemployment rate remains low, and labor market conditions remain solid. Inflation remains somewhat elevated. The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. Uncertainty about the economic outlook remains elevated. The Committee is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate. In support of its goals, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 4¼ to 4½ percent. In considering the extent and timing of additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. The Committee will continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities. The Committee is strongly committed to supporting maximum employment and returning inflation to its 2 percent objective. 14 July 29–30, 2025 In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals. The Committee’s assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.” Voting for this action: Jerome H. Powell, John C. Williams, Michael S. Barr, Susan M. Collins, Lisa D. Cook, Austan D. Goolsbee, Philip N. Jefferson, Alberto G. Musalem, and Jeffrey R. Schmid. Voting against this action: Michelle W. Bowman and Christopher J. Waller. Absent and not voting: Adriana D. Kugler Governors Bowman and Waller preferred to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by ¼ percentage point at this meeting. Governor Bowman preferred at this meeting to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 4 to 4¼ percent in light of inflation moving considerably closer to the Committee’s objective, after excluding temporary effects of tariffs, a labor market near full employment but with signs of less dynamism, and slowing economic growth this year. She also expressed her view that taking action to begin moving the policy rate at a gradual pace toward its neutral level would have proactively hedged against a further weakening in the economy and the risk of damage to the labor market. Consistent with the Committee’s decision to leave the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted unanimously to maintain the interest rate paid on reserve balances at 4.4 percent, effective July 31, 2025. The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted unanimously to approve the establishment of the primary credit rate at the existing level of 4.5 percent. It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Tuesday–Wednesday, September 16–17, 2025. The meeting adjourned at 10:15 a.m. on July 30, 2025. Notation Vote By notation vote completed on July 8, 2025, the Committee unanimously approved the minutes of the Committee meeting held on June 17–18, 2025. Attendance Jerome H. Powell, Chair John C.

{"date": "2025-09-17", "year": 2025, "source_type": "FOMC Minutes", "url": "https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20250917.pdf", "text": "FOMC FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee September 16–17, 2025 Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee September 16--17, 2025 A joint meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System was held in the offices of the Board of Governors on Tuesday, September 16, 2025, at 10:30 a.m. and continued on Wednesday, September 17, 2025, at 9:00 a.m.1 Developments in Financial Markets and Open Market Operations The deputy manager turned first to an overview of financial market developments during the intermeeting period. Markets appeared to interpret data releases and FOMC communications as indicating that the baseline outlook was little changed but that downside risks to the labor market had increased. Median modal expectations for personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation this year and next from the Open Market Desk’s Survey of Market Expectations (Desk survey) increased only slightly, and expectations for the unemployment rate increased only marginally overall. However, after the weaker-than-expected July and August employment reports, investors’ focus shifted to downside risks to the labor market. Near-term expectations for the policy rate had moved lower in response to weaker-than-expected employment data and the apparent rise in downside employment risks. Almost all respondents to the Desk survey expected a 25 basis point cut in the target range for the federal funds rate at this meeting, and around half expected an additional cut at the October meeting. The vast majority of survey respondents expected at least two 25 basis point cuts by year-end, with around half expecting three cuts over that time. Respondents’ expectations for 2027 and beyond were unchanged, implying that revisions to respondents’ near-term expectations reflected an anticipation of a faster return of the federal funds rate to its longer-run level than previously expected. Market-based measures of policy rate expectations were broadly consistent with responses to the Desk survey, reflecting about three 25 basis point cuts by the end of the year. The deputy manager then discussed developments in Treasury markets and market-based measures of inflation compensation. Nominal Treasury yields fell 20 to 40 basis points over the intermeeting 1 The Federal Open Market Committee is referenced as the “FOMC” and the “Committee” in these minutes; the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System is referenced as the “Board” in these minutes. 2 September 16-17, 2025 period, with the largest decline occurring at the short end of the yield curve; the curve therefore steepened. Staff models indicated that nearly all the decline in short-term rates was attributable to the shift down in policy rate expectations. Market-based measures of inflation compensation fell slightly over the intermeeting period. Equity prices continued to rise over the intermeeting period and stood very close to record highs despite the recent weaker-than-expected employment reports. The deputy manager noted this development was consistent with the benign baseline macroeconomic outlook incorporated in most private-sector forecasts and strong realized earnings in technology and other sectors. Corporate bond spreads were little changed over the intermeeting period and remained at tight levels, signaling that investors anticipated relatively moderate credit losses. Regarding foreign exchange developments, the deputy manager noted that the broad trade-weighted dollar index had generally stabilized and that the dollar returned to trading roughly in line with fundamental macroeconomic drivers over the intermeeting period. The available data continued to suggest foreign demand for U.S. assets remained resilient. The deputy manager turned next to money markets. The effective federal funds rate remained stable, and repurchase agreement (repo) rates moved higher over the intermeeting period. The increase in repo rates over the period was driven by the increase in net Treasury bill issuance amid the rebuilding of the Treasury General Account (TGA) following the debt ceiling resolution, continued large Treasury coupon issuance, and ongoing reductions in the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet. Reserves fell sharply on September 15 in response to an increase in the TGA, driven by tax receipts and significant net issuance of Treasury coupon securities. Repo rates came under additional upward pressure that day, and take-up at the standing repo facility (SRF) reached $1.5 billion. There were some signs of slight upward pressure on rates in the federal funds market but not enough to move the effective federal funds rate. While key indicators remained consistent with abundant reserves, money market rates were expected to continue to increase over time relative to administered rates and to eventually pull the effective federal funds rate higher. The deputy manager concluded by discussing the trajectory of the balance sheet. If balance sheet runoff were to continue at the current pace, the System Open Market Account (SOMA) portfolio was expected to decline to just over $6 trillion by the end of March, with Federal Reserve notes growing at a gradual pace, the TGA fluctuating around current levels, and usage of the overnight reverse repurchase agreement (ON RRP) facility remaining very low except on quarter-end dates. As a result, the deputy manager expected reserves to be close to the $2.8 trillion range by the end of the first quarter of next year if runoff were to continue at the current pace. Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee 3 All but one member of the Committee voted to ratify the Desk’s domestic transactions over the intermeeting period. Governor Stephen Miran, who had been sworn in as a member of the Board that morning, abstained from voting. There were no intervention operations in foreign currencies for the System’s account during the intermeeting period. Staff Review of the Economic Situation The information available at the time of the meeting indicated that real gross domestic product (GDP) growth had moderated in the first half of the year. Although the unemployment rate continued to be low, the pace of employment increases had slowed, and labor market conditions had softened. Consumer price inflation remained somewhat elevated. Total consumer price inflation—as measured by the 12-month change in the PCE price index—was estimated to have been 2.7 percent in August, based on the data from the consumer and producer price indexes. Core PCE price inflation, which excludes changes in consumer energy prices and many consumer food prices, was estimated to have been 2.9 percent in August. Both inflation rates were at the upper end of their ranges since the beginning of the year. Recent data indicated that labor market conditions had softened. The unemployment rate edged up to 4.3 percent in August, a little higher than it had been at the beginning of the year. The participation rate was somewhat lower in August than it was at the beginning of the year. Average monthly increases in total nonfarm payrolls over July and August were weak, and job gains were revised down notably in May and June. The Bureau of Labor Statistics’ (BLS) preliminary estimate of the benchmark revision for April 2024 through March 2025 indicated that the level of payrolls for March was more than 900,000 lower than had been reported. The ratio of job vacancies to unemployed workers was 1.0 in August and remained within the narrow range seen over the past year. The employment cost index of hourly compensation for private-sector workers increased 3.5 percent over the 12 months ending in June, and average hourly earnings for all employees rose 3.7 percent over the 12 months ending in August. Both wage growth measures were lower than their year-earlier levels. Real GDP rose in the second quarter after declining in the first quarter, but GDP growth over the first half as a whole was slower than last year. Growth of real private domestic final purchases (PDFP)— which comprises PCE and private fixed investment and which often provides a better signal than GDP of underlying economic momentum—had also moderated in the first half relative to last year. Recent indicators for consumer spending and business investment spending—particularly for high-tech equipment and software—pointed to further moderate gains in PDFP in the third quarter, but housing- sector activity remained weak. After falling sharply in the second quarter, real imports of goods increased in July, particularly for capital goods. By contrast, exports edged down in July, following modest increases over the first half of the year. 4 September 16-17, 2025 Foreign GDP growth slowed markedly in the second quarter, as the transitory boost due to the front- loading of U.S. imports earlier in the year faded. Canadian economic activity contracted significantly, as exports of price-sensitive industrial supplies fell sharply in the face of higher U.S. tariffs. Economic growth in Mexico and parts of Asia was supported by strong demand for high-tech products. Headline inflation was near central banks’ targets in most foreign economies, aided by past declines in energy prices. However, core inflation remained persistently elevated in some economies, such as Brazil, Mexico, and the U.K. By contrast, inflation in China continued to be subdued. Several foreign central banks—including the European Central Bank—held their policy rates steady, while others—such as the Reserve Bank of New Zealand and the Reserve Bank of Australia—resumed reducing their policy rates, as disinflation continued. Staff Review of the Financial Situation The market-implied path of the federal funds rate decreased notably over the intermeeting period. Options on interest rate futures suggested that market participants were placing a higher probability on greater policy easing by early 2026 than they had just before the July FOMC meeting. Consistent with the downward shift in the implied policy rate path, nominal Treasury yields declined notably, on net, particularly at shorter horizons. Changes in nominal yields were driven primarily by reductions in real Treasury yields as inflation compensation fell to a lesser degree, on net, across maturities. Broad equity price indexes increased amid strong corporate earnings reports and expectations of lower policy rates, while credit spreads were little changed and remained very low by historical standards. The one-month option-implied volatility on the S&P 500 index—the VIX—ended the period essentially unchanged, on net, at a moderate level. Risk sentiment generally improved in global financial markets, supported by trade policy developments that were perceived as reducing negative tail risks to economic growth, strong corporate earnings, and lower interest rates in the U.S. On balance, foreign equity indexes rose moderately, credit spreads narrowed slightly, and the exchange value of the dollar declined modestly. Increased political uncertainty led to volatility of longer-term government bond yields in some advanced foreign economies. Conditions in U.S. short-term funding markets remained orderly over the intermeeting period, and the FOMC’s target policy rate continued to transmit to private rates in the usual manner. Following the increase in the federal debt limit in early July, TGA balances continued to increase, while usage of the ON RRP facility declined notably to its lowest levels since April 2021. Amid increases in the TGA, there were mild upward pressures in secured market rates over the July and August month-ends. Secured rates remained elevated in the lead-up to the mid-September tax and coupon issuance date. On Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee 5 September 15, the Secured Overnight Financing Rate temporarily printed above the minimum bid rate at the SRF amid $1.5 billion in take-up at the facility. Amid these movements in secured rates, the effective federal funds rate remained unchanged relative to the interest rate on reserve balances. In domestic credit markets, borrowing costs generally declined but remained elevated relative to their average post–Global Financial Crisis (GFC) levels. Yields on corporate bonds decreased moderately, while yields on leveraged loans were little changed on net. Interest rates on commercial and industrial (C&I) and short-term business loans remained elevated relative to their post-GFC averages. Rates on 30-year fixed-rate conforming residential mortgages declined moderately, on net, and remained elevated. Yields on higher-rated tranches of commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) moved down modestly, and those on lower-rated tranches of non-agency CMBS declined notably. Interest rates on existing credit card accounts continued to tick up through June, while offer rates on new credit cards were little changed. Financing from capital markets remained broadly available for medium-sized and large businesses. Gross issuance of nonfinancial corporate bonds across credit categories continued at a strong pace in July and August, and issuance of leveraged loans was robust in recent months. Lending in private credit markets continued at a solid pace in July. After relatively strong growth in the second quarter, C&I loan balances on banks’ books also continued to grow at a solid pace in July and August. Commercial real estate (CRE) loans continued to grow at a modest pace in July and August. Credit remained available for most businesses, households, and municipalities, while credit continued to be relatively tight for small businesses and households with lower credit scores. In the residential mortgage market, credit remained easily available for high-credit-score borrowers who met standard conforming loan criteria but generally tight for low-credit-score borrowers. While consumer credit remained generally available for most households, the growth of revolving credit and auto loans was relatively weak in the second quarter. Credit quality was generally stable at levels somewhat weaker than during the pre-pandemic period. The credit performance of corporate bonds and leveraged loans remained generally stable, though the default rate for leveraged loans that includes distressed exchanges continued to be elevated. Delinquency rates on small business loans in June and July ticked up and were moderately above pre- pandemic levels. In the CRE market, CMBS delinquency rates remained elevated through August. Regarding household credit quality, the delinquency rates on Federal Housing Administration mortgages remained at the upper end of their range over the past few years. By contrast, delinquency rates on most other mortgage loan types stayed near historical lows. In the second quarter, credit card and auto loan delinquency rates remained at elevated levels but were little changed. 6 September 16-17, 2025 Staff Economic Outlook Compared with the staff forecast prepared for the July meeting, the projection of real GDP growth was revised up somewhat, on balance, for this year through 2028, primarily reflecting stronger-than- expected data for both consumer spending and business investment as well as financial conditions that were projected to be a little more supportive of output growth. GDP growth was still projected to be faster next year than this year, as the effects of tariff increases and slower net immigration were expected to diminish. The staff continued to expect that the labor market would soften further this year, though the projected path for the unemployment rate in following years was a little lower than in the previous staff forecast. The unemployment rate was projected to move slightly above the staff’s estimate of its natural rate through the remainder of this year and then to decline later in the projection as GDP growth picked up. The staff’s inflation projection was only slightly revised from the one prepared for the July meeting. Tariff increases were still expected to raise inflation this year and to provide some further upward pressure on inflation in 2026. Inflation was projected to decline in 2026, to reach 2 percent in 2027, and to remain there in 2028. The staff continued to view the uncertainty around the projection as elevated, primarily reflecting uncertainty regarding changes to economic policies, including those for trade, immigration, fiscal spending, and regulation, and their associated economic effects. Risks to employment and the labor market were judged to have become a little more tilted to the downside, stemming from the recent softening in labor market conditions amid modest real GDP growth. The staff continued to view the risks around the inflation forecast as skewed to the upside, as the projected rise in inflation this year could prove to be more persistent than assumed in the baseline projection. Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, participants submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation for each year from 2025 through 2028 and over the longer run. The projections were based on participants’ individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy, including their projections of the federal funds rate. Participants also provided their individual assessments of the level of uncertainty and the balance of risks associated with their projections. The Summary of Economic Projections was released to the public after the meeting. Participants observed that inflation had moved up since the beginning of the year and remained somewhat above the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run goal. Although participants generally assessed that this year’s tariff increases had put upward pressure on inflation, some remarked that Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee 7 these effects appeared to have been somewhat muted to date relative to expectations from earlier in the year. A few participants suggested that productivity gains may be reducing inflation pressures. A couple of participants expressed the view that, excluding the effects of this year’s tariff increases, inflation would be close to target. A few other participants, however, emphasized that progress of inflation toward the Committee’s 2 percent objective had stalled, even excluding the effects of this year’s tariff increases. With regard to the outlook for inflation, participants generally expected that, given appropriate monetary policy, inflation would be somewhat elevated in the near term and would gradually return to 2 percent thereafter. Some participants noted that business contacts had indicated that they would raise prices over time because of higher input costs stemming from tariff increases. Uncertainty remained about the inflation effects of this year’s increase in tariffs, though most participants expected these effects to be realized by the end of next year. Some participants remarked that the labor market was not expected to be a source of inflationary pressure. A couple of participants expected that the reduction in net migration would be associated with lower demand and lower inflation, and a couple of participants observed that continued productivity gains would likely reduce inflation pressures. Participants noted that longer-term inflation expectations continued to be well anchored and that it was important they remain so to help return inflation to 2 percent. Various participants stressed the central role of monetary policy in ensuring that longer-term inflation expectations remained well anchored. A majority of participants emphasized upside risks to their outlooks for inflation, pointing to inflation readings moving further from 2 percent, continued uncertainty about the effects of tariffs, the possibility that elevated inflation proves to be more persistent than currently expected even after the inflation effects of this year’s tariff increases fade, or the possibility of longer-term inflation expectations moving up after a long period of elevated inflation readings. Some participants remarked that they perceived less upside risk to their outlooks for inflation than earlier in the year. In their discussion of the labor market, participants observed that job gains had slowed and the unemployment rate had edged up. Participants noted that the low level of estimated job gains over recent months likely reflected declines in growth of both labor supply and labor demand. Participants noted low net immigration or changes in labor force participation as factors reducing labor supply. As for factors that may be reducing labor demand, participants noted moderate economic growth or the effects of high uncertainty on firms’ hiring decisions. Under these circumstances, participants cited a number of other indicators as helpful for assessing labor market conditions. These included the unemployment rate, the ratio of job vacancies to unemployed workers, wage growth, the percentage of unemployed workers who find a job, the quits rate among employed workers, and the layoff rate. Participants generally assessed that recent readings of these indicators did not show a sharp 8 September 16-17, 2025 deterioration in labor market conditions. A few participants, though, saw recently released labor market data, including revisions to previously released data and the BLS’s preliminary estimate of the payroll employment benchmark revision, as indicating that labor market conditions had been softening for longer than was previously reported. With regard to the outlook for the labor market, participants generally expected that, under appropriate monetary policy, labor market conditions would be little changed or would soften modestly. Several participants noted that the number of monthly job gains consistent with a stable unemployment rate had declined over the past year and would likely remain low, citing the large number of workers nearing retirement age or continued low net immigration. Participants indicated that their outlooks for the labor market were uncertain and viewed downside risks to employment as having increased over the intermeeting period. In support of this view, participants mentioned a number of indicators, including the following: low hiring and firing rates, which are evidence of less dynamism in the labor market; concentrated job gains in a small number of sectors; and increases in unemployment rates for groups that have historically shown greater sensitivity to cyclical changes in economic activity, such as those for African Americans and young people. Several participants saw continuing adoption of artificial intelligence as potentially reducing labor demand. Some participants noted that survey responses indicated that household sentiment regarding the labor market had moved down. Participants observed that growth of economic activity slowed in the first half of the year relative to last year. Regarding the household sector, participants noted that lower consumption growth had contributed to the slowdown in the growth of economic activity in the first half of the year. Several participants remarked that recent data indicated some firming of consumption expenditures this quarter. Some participants mentioned that households were showing greater price sensitivity, and several participants observed that high-income households were increasingly doing better, economically, than lower-income households. Several participants noted continued weakness in the housing market, and a couple of participants mentioned the possibility of a more substantial deterioration in the housing market as a downside risk to economic activity. For businesses, many participants noted strong high-tech investment. Several participants noted that financial conditions were supportive of economic activity. A few participants commented that the agricultural sector continued to face headwinds because of low crop prices and high input costs. In their consideration of monetary policy at this meeting, participants noted that inflation had risen recently and remained somewhat elevated, and that recent indicators suggested that growth of economic activity had moderated in the first half of the year. While participants noted the unemployment rate remained low, they observed that it had edged up and job gains had slowed. In addition, they judged that downside risks to employment had risen. Against this backdrop, almost all Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee 9 participants supported reducing the target range for the federal funds rate ¼ percentage point at this meeting. Participants generally noted that their judgments about this meeting’s appropriate policy action reflected a shift in the balance of risks. In particular, most participants observed that it was appropriate to move the target range for the federal funds rate toward a more neutral setting because they judged that downside risks to employment had increased over the intermeeting period and that upside risks to inflation had either diminished or not increased. A few participants stated there was merit in keeping the federal funds rate unchanged at this meeting or that they could have supported such a decision. These participants noted that progress toward the Committee’s 2 percent inflation objective had stalled this year as inflation readings increased and expressed concern that longer-term inflation expectations may rise if inflation does not return to its objective in a timely manner. One participant agreed with the need to move policy toward a more neutral stance but preferred a ½ percentage point reduction at this meeting. All participants judged it appropriate to continue the process of reducing the Federal Reserve’s securities holdings. In considering the outlook for monetary policy, almost all participants noted that, with the reduction in the target range for the federal funds rate at this meeting, the Committee was well positioned to respond in a timely way to potential economic developments. Participants observed that monetary policy was not on a preset course and would be informed by a wide range of incoming data, the evolving economic outlook, and the balance of risks. Participants expressed a range of views about the degree to which the current stance of monetary policy was restrictive and about the likely future path of policy. Most judged that it likely would be appropriate to ease policy further over the remainder of this year. Some participants noted that, by several measures, financial conditions suggested that monetary policy may not be particularly restrictive, which they judged as warranting a cautious approach in the consideration of future policy changes. In discussing risk-management considerations that could bear on the outlook for monetary policy, participants generally judged that upside risks to inflation remained elevated and that downside risks to employment were elevated and had increased. Participants noted that, in these circumstances, if policy were eased too much or too soon and inflation continued to be elevated, then longer-term inflation expectations could become unanchored and make restoring price stability even more challenging. By contrast, if policy rates were kept too high for too long, then unemployment could rise unnecessarily, and the economy could slow sharply. Against this backdrop, participants stressed the importance of taking a balanced approach in promoting the Committee’s employment and inflation goals, taking into account the extent of departures from those goals and the potentially different time horizons over which employment and inflation are projected to return to levels judged consistent with the Committee’s mandate. 10 September 16-17, 2025 Several participants remarked on issues related to the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet and implementation of monetary policy. A few participants stated that balance sheet reduction had proceeded smoothly thus far and that various indicators pointed to reserves remaining abundant. Nevertheless, with reserves declining and expected to decline further, they noted that it was important to continue to monitor money market conditions closely and evaluate how close reserves were to their ample level. In that context, a few participants noted that the SRF would help keep the federal funds rate within its target range and ensure that temporary pressures in money markets would not disrupt the ongoing reduction in Federal Reserve securities holdings to the level needed to implement monetary policy efficiently and effectively in the Committee’s ample-reserves regime. Committee Policy Actions In their discussions of monetary policy for this meeting, members agreed that recent indicators suggested that growth of economic activity had moderated in the first half of the year. To reflect developments in the labor market, they agreed to no longer characterize labor market conditions as solid and instead state that job gains had slowed and that the unemployment rate had edged up but remained low. Members concurred that inflation remained somewhat elevated and agreed to add that inflation had moved up. They agreed that the Committee was attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate and to add that downside risks to employment had risen to reflect their concerns about the labor market. In support of the Committee’s goals and in light of the shift in the balance of risks, almost all members agreed to lower the target range for the federal funds rate ¼ percentage point to 4 to 4¼ percent. One member voted against that decision, preferring to lower the target range ½ percentage point at this meeting. Members agreed that, in considering additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee would carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. All members agreed that the postmeeting statement should affirm their strong commitment both to supporting maximum employment and to returning inflation to the Committee’s 2 percent objective. Members agreed that, in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee would continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. They would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerged that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals. Members also agreed that their assessments would take into account a wide range of information, including readings on labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments. Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee 11 At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the following domestic policy directive, for release at 2:00 p.m.: “Effective September 18, 2025, the Federal Open Market Committee directs the Desk to: • Undertake open market operations as necessary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of 4 to 4¼ percent. • Conduct standing overnight repurchase agreement operations with a minimum bid rate of 4.25 percent and with an aggregate operation limit of $500 billion. • Conduct standing overnight reverse repurchase agreement operations at an offering rate of 4 percent and with a per-counterparty limit of $160 billion per day. • Roll over at auction the amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of Treasury securities maturing in each calendar month that exceeds a cap of $5 billion per month. Redeem Treasury coupon securities up to this monthly cap and Treasury bills to the extent that coupon principal payments are less than the monthly cap. • Reinvest the amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) received in each calendar month that exceeds a cap of $35 billion per month into Treasury securities to roughly match the maturity composition of Treasury securities outstanding. • Allow modest deviations from stated amounts for reinvestments, if needed for operational reasons.” The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below for release at 2:00 p.m.: “Recent indicators suggest that growth of economic activity moderated in the first half of the year. Job gains have slowed, and the unemployment rate has edged up but remains low. Inflation has moved up and remains somewhat elevated. The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. Uncertainty about the economic outlook remains elevated. The Committee is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate and judges that downside risks to employment have risen. In support of its goals and in light of the shift in the balance of risks, the Committee decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by ¼ percentage point to 4 to 4¼ percent. In considering additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the 12 September 16-17, 2025 Committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. The Committee will continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities. The Committee is strongly committed to supporting maximum employment and returning inflation to its 2 percent objective. In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals. The Committee’s assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.” Voting for this action: Jerome H. Powell, John C. Williams, Michael S. Barr, Michelle W. Bowman, Susan M. Collins, Lisa D. Cook, Austan D. Goolsbee, Philip N. Jefferson, Alberto G. Musalem, Jeffrey R. Schmid, and Christopher J. Waller. Voting against this action: Stephen I. Miran. Governor Miran preferred to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by ½ percentage point at this meeting in light of further softening in the labor market over the first half of the year and underlying inflation that in his view was meaningfully closer to 2 percent than was apparent in the data. Governor Miran also expressed the view that additional policy easing was also appropriate to reflect that the neutral rate of interest had fallen due to factors such as increased tariff revenues that had raised net national savings and changes in immigration policy that had reduced population growth. Consistent with the Committee’s decision to lower the target range for the federal funds rate to 4 to 4¼ percent, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted to lower the interest rate paid on reserve balances to 4.15 percent, effective September 18, 2025. The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted to approve a ¼ percentage point decrease in the primary credit rate to 4.25 percent, effective September 18, 2025.2 It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Tuesday–Wednesday, October 28–29, 2025. The meeting adjourned at 10:10 a.m. on September 17, 2025. 2 In taking this action, the Board approved requests to establish that rate submitted by the Boards of Directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco. The vote also encompassed approval by the Board of Governors of the establishment of a 4.25 percent primary credit rate by the remaining Federal Reserve Banks, effective on September 18, 2025, or the date such Reserve Banks inform the Secretary of the Board of such a request. (Secretary’s note: Subsequently, the Federal Reserve Banks of Cleveland and St. Louis were informed of the Board’s approval of their establishment of a primary credit rate of 4.25 percent, effective September 18, 2025.)

The elected members and alternate members were as fol- lows: John C. Williams, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, with Sushmita Shukla, First Vice President of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, as alternate; Thomas I. Barkin, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, with Susan M. Collins, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, as alternate; Loretta J. Mester, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, with Austan D. Goolsbee, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, as alternate; Raphael W. Bostic, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, with Kathleen O’Neill, Interim Presi- dent of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, as alter- nate; Mary C. Daly, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, with Jeffrey R. Schmid, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, as alternate. By unanimous vote, the following officers of the Com- mittee were selected to serve until the selection of their successors at the first regularly scheduled meeting of the Committee in 2025: Jerome H. Powell Chair John C. Williams Vice Chair Joshua Gallin Secretary Matthew M. Luecke Deputy Secretary Brian J. Bonis Assistant Secretary Michelle A. Smith Assistant Secretary Mark E. Van Der Weide General Counsel Richard Ostrander Deputy General Counsel Charles C. Gray Assistant General Counsel Trevor A. Reeve Economist Stacey Tevlin Economist Beth Anne Wilson Economist Shaghil Ahmed Kartik B. Athreya6 James A. Clouse 5 Committee organizational documents are available at www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/rules_authoriza- tions.htm. Brian M. Doyle Edward S. Knotek II David E. Lebow Sylvain Leduc Paula Tkac William Wascher Alexander L. Wolman Associate Economists By unanimous vote, the Committee selected the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to execute transactions for the System Open Market Account (SOMA). By unanimous vote, the Committee selected Roberto Perli and Julie Ann Remache to serve at the pleasure of the Committee as manager and deputy manager of the SOMA, respectively, on the understanding that these se- lections were subject to being satisfactory to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Secretary’s note: The Federal Reserve Bank of New York subsequently sent advice that the se- lections indicated previously were satisfactory. By unanimous vote, the Committee approved the FOMC Authorizations and Continuing Directives for Open Market Operations, with a revision to Section II, Continuing Directive for Domestic Open Market Oper- ations, to add a standing seven-day term option to the existing standing Foreign and International Monetary Authorities Repurchase Agreement Operations. Ahead of the vote on policies relating to investment and trading, information security, and external communica- tions, the Chair commented on the critical importance of earning and keeping the public’s trust in the impar- tiality of the Committee’s decisionmaking. A revised in- vestment and trading policy was proposed which ex- panded the scope of employees subject to the Commit- tee’s investment and trading rules, and introduced new investment restrictions on all employees with access to FOMC information. All participants indicated support for, and agreed to abide by, the FOMC Policy on Invest- ment and Trading for Committee Participants and Fed- eral Reserve System Staff, the Program for Security of FOMC Information, the FOMC Policy on External Communications of Committee Participants, and the FOMC Policy on External Communications of Federal Reserve System Staff. The Committee voted unani- mously to approve those four policies.5 6 Kartik B. Athreya’s selection was effective upon employment at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Minutes of the Meeting of January 30–31, 2024 Page 3 Ahead of the vote on the Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, the Chair indicated the next five-year review of the statement would begin in the latter half of this year, and the results would be announced about a year later. All participants indicated support for the Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, and the Committee voted unanimously to reaffirm it without revision.5 Developments in Financial Markets and Open Market Operations The manager turned first to a review of developments in financial markets over the intermeeting period. Finan- cial conditions eased modestly but remained about as tight as they were last summer and much tighter than when the hiking cycle began. Over the intermeeting pe- riod, declines in nominal Treasury yields were concen- trated at the front end of the yield curve. Staff models suggested that the declines in shorter-term yields were mostly attributable to a lower expected policy rate path and were concentrated in expected real rates, while ex- pected inflation was little changed. Pricing of inflation derivatives continued to suggest a near-term path of in- flation consistent with a return to 2 percent later this year. Broad equity prices reached new highs over the intermeeting period, but they were driven mostly by the strong gains of large-capitalization technology compa- nies; broader measures of equity valuations were more subdued. Still, equities appeared priced for continued economic resilience. The manager turned next to expectations for monetary policy. Market participants broadly viewed recent infla- tion data and the December Summary of Economic Pro- jections (SEP) as increasing the odds that rate cuts might start sooner than previously thought. The modal path of the federal funds rate from the Open Market Desk’s Survey of Primary Dealers and Survey of Market Partic- ipants was little changed from December but showed an increased likelihood of earlier rate cuts. The modal path implied by options prices declined some over the inter- meeting period. Both modal paths were closer to the December median SEP projection than the average path for the policy rate implied by futures prices, which had declined more substantially over the period. The fu- tures-based path likely reflected the effect of investors’ perceived probability of more substantial rate cuts rather than their baseline expectations. Communications over the period heightened market at- tention around a potential slowing of balance sheet run- off. Most Desk survey respondents expected a slowing of the pace to start by July, although there was consider- able uncertainty about the exact start date. The average expected timing for the end of runoff shifted slightly ear- lier, and the portfolio size at the end of runoff was slightly higher than in the December surveys. Regarding developments in money markets and Desk operations, the effective federal funds rate was stable over the intermeeting period. While the Secured Over- night Financing Rate experienced temporary and modest upward pressure over the past few month-ends, includ- ing the year-end, such a pattern was common before the pandemic. The usage of the overnight reverse repur- chase agreement (ON RRP) facility continued to fall over the period, with balances below $600 billion in late January. Since June 2023, when the debt ceiling was sus- pended, usage of the ON RRP facility had declined at a much faster pace than the Federal Reserve securities portfolio, and reserve balances had increased some. As part of its ongoing market surveillance, the staff con- tinued to monitor a wide range of money market indica- tors; those gauges suggested that the supply of reserves remained abundant. The staff also noted that once the ON RRP facility is either depleted or stabilized at a low level, reserves will decline at a pace comparable with the runoff of the Federal Reserve’s securities portfolio, all else equal. By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk’s domestic transactions over the intermeeting period. There were no intervention operations in foreign curren- cies for the System’s account during the intermeeting pe- riod. Staff Review of the Economic Situation The data available at the time of the January 30–31 meet- ing indicated that growth in U.S. real gross domestic product (GDP) was solid in the fourth quarter of 2023 but had stepped down from the third quarter’s strong pace. Labor market conditions continued to be tight but showed further signs of easing. Consumer price infla- tion had declined markedly over the course of the year, though it remained above 2 percent. Labor demand and supply continued to gradually move into better alignment. The average monthly pace of nonfarm payroll employment gains in the fourth quarter was slower than in the third quarter. The unemployment rate remained at 3.7 percent in December, the same as its third-quarter average. However, the labor force par- ticipation rate moved down, as did the employment-to- population ratio. The African American unemployment rate declined, and the rate for Hispanics rose; both rates were higher than those for Asians and for whites. The private-sector job openings rate was little changed in November and December, and the quits rate edged Page 4 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ down; both rates were below their levels at the start of 2023. Easing labor market imbalances were also appar- ent in the wage data, with the December 12-month changes in the employment cost index and in average hourly earnings for all employees each below their year- earlier levels. Consumer price inflation continued to slow. The price index for total personal consumption expenditures (PCE) increased 2.6 percent over the 12 months ending in December, while core PCE price inflation—which ex- cludes changes in energy prices and many consumer food prices—was 2.9 percent over the same period. Both total and core PCE price inflation were well below their year-earlier levels. The trimmed mean measure of 12-month PCE price inflation constructed by the Fed- eral Reserve Bank of Dallas was 3.3 percent in Decem- ber, also lower than its level a year earlier. Survey measures of consumers’ short-run inflation expectations moved lower in December, while survey measures of medium- to longer-term inflation expectations were broadly in line with the levels seen in the decade before the pandemic. According to the advance estimate, real GDP rose at a solid pace in the fourth quarter. Private domestic final purchases—which comprises PCE and private fixed in- vestment and which often provides a better signal than GDP of underlying economic momentum—also rose solidly, though at a slower rate. Real exports grew robustly in the fourth quarter of 2023, driven in part by a jump in exports of industrial supplies, which had declined markedly earlier last year. By con- trast, real imports grew at a tepid pace, as gains in im- ports of capital goods and services were partially offset by declines in imports of consumer goods and autos. All told, net exports contributed about ½ percentage point to U.S. GDP growth in the fourth quarter after making roughly neutral contributions in the preceding two quar- ters. Foreign economic growth remained subdued in the fourth quarter. In the advanced foreign economies (AFEs), a significant tightening of monetary policy over the past two years, the erosion of real household in- comes from high inflation rates, and the repercussions of last year’s energy shock in Europe continued to weigh on economic activity. In China, a property-sector slump and depressed consumer confidence continued to weigh on domestic demand, with the government rolling out a series of policy measures to support growth. Economic activity in Asia excluding China firmed, supported in part by rebounding global demand for high-tech prod- ucts. Foreign headline inflation continued to fall. However, the pace of decline had varied across countries as well as sectors, with a moderation in goods prices generally hav- ing outpaced that in services prices. Most major foreign central banks kept their policy rates unchanged over the intermeeting period and emphasized the need to main- tain a stance of policy that is sufficiently restrictive to ensure that inflation falls back to their targets. Staff Review of the Financial Situation Over the intermeeting period, nominal Treasury yields declined, and the expected market-implied path for the federal funds rate through 2024 shifted downward, as market participants viewed monetary policy communi- cations, on balance, as pointing to notably less restrictive policy than expected. Indicators of broad financial con- ditions eased over the period, but the staff’s Financial Conditions Impulse on Growth index remained restric- tive. Similarly, financing conditions for households and businesses continued to be moderately restrictive, as borrowing costs remained elevated. The market-implied path for the federal funds rate through 2024 decreased over the intermeeting period. A straight read of federal funds futures rates suggested that market participants were placing higher odds on signifi- cant policy easing in 2024 than they did just before the December FOMC meeting. Beyond 2024, the policy rate path implied by overnight index swap quotes de- clined. Consistent with the decline in the implied policy path, short- and intermediate-term Treasury yields also declined notably. Real yields declined more than nomi- nal yields, implying somewhat higher measures of infla- tion compensation. Market-based measures of interest rate uncertainty remained highly elevated by historical standards. Broad stock price indexes increased, and spreads on in- vestment- and speculative-grade bonds narrowed mod- estly over the intermeeting period. The one-month op- tion-implied volatility on the S&P 500 increased some- what over the period but remained low by historical standards. Movements in foreign markets over the intermeeting pe- riod were modest, on net, with most foreign asset prices and the exchange value of the dollar little changed. Mar- ket participants generally considered current levels of most AFE policy rates to be at the peaks of their respec- tive tightening cycles. Declines in market-based measures of U.S. policy expectations contributed to a moderate step-down in short-term yields in most AFEs, _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Minutes of the Meeting of January 30–31, 2024 Page 5 while longer-term foreign yields were little changed. Ma- jor AFE equity indexes increased slightly. Conditions in short-term funding markets remained sta- ble over the intermeeting period, with typical dynamics observed surrounding year-end. Usage of the ON RRP facility continued to decline over the period, primarily reflecting money market funds reallocating their assets to Treasury bills and private-market repurchase agree- ments, which offered slightly more attractive market rates relative to the ON RRP rate. Banks’ total deposit levels were roughly unchanged in the fourth quarter of last year, as outflows of core deposits were about offset by inflows of large time deposits. In domestic credit markets, borrowing costs for most businesses, households, and municipalities decreased moderately over the intermeeting period but remained elevated. Rates on loans to households declined over the intermeeting period but remained relatively high, while interest rates on existing credit card accounts were little changed. Interest rates on commercial and indus- trial (C&I) loans and small business loans increased over the intermeeting period. Yields declined on a broad ar- ray of fixed-income securities, including investment- and speculative-grade corporate bonds, residential and com- mercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS), and munic- ipal bonds. The declines were largely driven by decreases in Treasury yields and, to some extent, by narrower spreads. Credit continued to be generally available to businesses, households, and municipalities. However, credit availa- bility for smaller firms continued to tighten. Total core loans at banks increased slightly in the fourth quarter. Financing in capital markets continued to be available, although issuance in most markets remained at moderate levels. In the January Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices (SLOOS), banks reported tight- ening standards and terms on C&I loans to firms of all sizes over the fourth quarter. Regarding commercial real estate (CRE), banks reported tightening standards across all loan categories in the fourth quarter. Banks reported that they expected to keep lending standards unchanged for C&I loans and to tighten standards for CRE loans during 2024. Credit in the residential mortgage market remained easily available for high-credit-score borrowers who met standard conforming loan criteria, and consumer credit remained available for most borrowers. Growth in credit card balances was strong in November, though SLOOS respondents indicated that standards for credit cards tightened in the fourth quarter and were expected to tighten further over 2024. Auto loan balances grew modestly in November. A modest share of banks re- ported in the SLOOS that they tightened standards on auto loans in the fourth quarter and expected to tighten them further over 2024. The credit quality of businesses and households deterio- rated slightly but remained broadly solid, as delinquency rates in most sectors were relatively low. Delinquency rates on conventional mortgages remained low, while delinquency rates on credit cards and auto loans rose in the third quarter to levels notably above those just be- fore the pandemic. The credit quality of nonfinancial firms borrowing in the corporate bond and leveraged loan markets remained sound overall. Aggregate delin- quency rates on CMBS backed by office properties con- tinued to be elevated in November. In the January SLOOS, banks reported that credit quality was expected to deteriorate somewhat across loan categories over 2024. The staff provided an update on its assessment of the stability of the U.S. financial system and, on balance, characterized the system’s financial vulnerabilities as no- table. The staff judged that asset valuation pressures re- mained notable, as valuations across a range of markets appeared high relative to fundamentals. House prices increased to the upper end of their historical range, rela- tive to rents and Treasury yields, though underwriting standards remained restrictive. CRE prices continued to decline, especially in the multifamily and office sectors, and low levels of transactions in the office sector likely indicated that prices had not yet fully reflected the sec- tor’s weaker fundamentals. Vulnerabilities associated with business and household debt were characterized as moderate. Nonfinancial business debt growth declined, and the ability of firms to service their debt remained high relative to history. Leverage in the financial sector was characterized as no- table. In the banking sector, regulatory risk-based capital ratios continued to increase and indicated ample loss- bearing capacity in the banking system. The fair value of banks’ longer-term fixed-rate assets, including loans, increased in the fourth quarter as longer-term interest rates decreased, though banks remained vulnerable to significant increases in longer-term interest rates. Insur- ers had been increasing their investments in risky corpo- rate debt. Funding risks were also characterized as no- table. Uninsured deposits declined in the aggregate but remained high for some banks. Assets in prime money market mutual funds and other cash management vehi- cles continued to increase. Page 6 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Staff Economic Outlook The economic forecast prepared by the staff for the Jan- uary meeting was slightly stronger than the December projection, as the upward revision to 2023 GDP growth implied by incoming data boosted the level of output throughout the projection period. The lagged effects of earlier monetary policy actions, through their continued contribution to tight financial and credit conditions, were still expected to push output growth in 2024 and 2025 below the staff’s estimate of potential growth; in 2026, output was expected to rise in line with potential. The projected path for the unemployment rate was re- vised down slightly, reflecting the upward revision to the level of output. Total and core PCE price inflation were both projected to step down in 2024 as demand and supply in product and labor markets moved into better alignment. By 2026, total and core PCE price inflation were expected to be close to 2 percent. The staff continued to view the uncertainty around the baseline projection as elevated but noted that this uncer- tainty had diminished substantially over the past year. Risks around the inflation forecast were seen as tilted slightly to the upside; although inflation had come in close to expectations throughout most of 2023, the staff placed some weight on the possibility that further pro- gress in reducing inflation could take longer than ex- pected. The risks around the forecast for real activity were viewed as skewed to the downside, as any substan- tial setback in reducing inflation might lead to a tighten- ing of financial conditions that would slow the pace of real activity by more than the staff anticipated in their baseline forecast. In addition, the possibility of a larger- than-expected erosion of households’ financial positions was seen as a downside risk to the projection for real activity. Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook In their discussion of current economic conditions, par- ticipants noted that recent indicators suggested that eco- nomic activity had been expanding at a solid pace. Real GDP growth in the fourth quarter of last year came in above 3 percent at an annual rate, below the strong growth posted in the third quarter but still above most forecasters’ expectations. Participants observed that the unexpected strength in real GDP growth in the fourth quarter reflected stronger-than-expected net exports and inventory investment, which tend to be volatile and may carry little signal for future growth. Still, consumption continued to grow at a solid pace. In addition to strong demand, many participants attributed the recent expan- sion in economic activity to favorable supply develop- ments. Participants noted that the pace of job gains had moderated since early last year but remained strong and that the unemployment rate had remained low. Inflation had eased over the past year but remained elevated. Regarding the economic outlook, participants judged that the current stance of monetary policy was restrictive and would continue to put downward pressure on eco- nomic activity and inflation. Accordingly, they expected that supply and demand in product and labor markets would continue to move into better balance. In light of the policy restraint in place, along with more favorable inflation data amid ongoing improvements in supply conditions, participants viewed the risks to achieving the Committee’s employment and inflation goals as moving into better balance. However, participants noted that the economic outlook was uncertain and that they re- mained highly attentive to inflation risks. In their discussion of inflation, participants observed that inflation had eased over the past year but remained above the Committee’s 2 percent inflation objective. They remained concerned that elevated inflation contin- ued to harm households, especially those with limited means to absorb higher prices. While the inflation data had indicated significant disinflation in the second half of last year, participants observed that they would be carefully assessing incoming data in judging whether in- flation was moving down sustainably toward 2 percent. Participants noted improvements in both headline and core inflation and discussed the underlying components of these series. Although total PCE inflation in Decem- ber remained above the Committee’s 2 percent objective on a 12-month basis, on a 6-month basis, total PCE in- flation was near 2 percent at an annual rate, and core PCE inflation was just below 2 percent. Participants judged that some of the recent improvement in inflation reflected idiosyncratic movements in a few series. Nev- ertheless, they viewed that there had been significant progress recently on inflation returning to the Commit- tee’s longer-run goal. Many participants indicated that they expected core nonhousing services inflation to gradually decline further as the labor market continued to move into better balance and wage growth moderated further. Various participants noted that housing services inflation was likely to fall further as the deceleration in rents on new leases continued to pass through to measures of such inflation. While many participants pointed to disinflationary pressures associated with im- provements in aggregate supply—such as increases in the labor force or better productivity growth—a couple _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Minutes of the Meeting of January 30–31, 2024 Page 7 of participants judged that the downward pressure on core goods prices from the normalization of supply chains was likely to moderate. Participants observed that longer-term inflation expec- tations had remained well anchored at a level consistent with the Committee’s 2 percent inflation objective. Measures of near-term inflation expectations had also declined recently, in some cases to within their ranges in the years before the pandemic. Some participants pointed to reports from contacts that firms could not as easily pass on price increases to consumers or were mak- ing less frequent price adjustments than they had in re- cent years. In their discussion of the household sector, participants observed that consumer spending had been stronger than expected, supported by low unemployment and solid income growth. A number of participants judged that consumption growth was likely to moderate this year, as growth in labor income was expected to slow and pandemic-related excess savings were expected to diminish. In addition, some participants noted signs that the finances of some households—especially those in the low- and moderate-income categories—were in- creasingly coming under pressure, which these partici- pants saw as a downside risk to the outlook for con- sumption. In particular, they pointed to increased usage of credit card revolving balances and buy-now-pay-later services, as well as increased delinquency rates for some types of consumer loans. The reports of business contacts cited by participants varied across industries and Districts. In a few Districts, contacts reported that the pace of economic activity was steady or solid, while in several others, contacts ex- pressed increased optimism about the economic outlook and prospects for investment. District reports from manufacturers were mixed, as some contacts saw in- creased activity, whereas others saw subdued or weaken- ing activity. A couple of participants noted that although soft commodity prices and elevated borrowing costs had contributed to a decline in farm incomes recently, agri- cultural land values remained resilient, and delinquencies on farm loans continued to be low. A few participants remarked that financing and credit conditions were par- ticularly challenging for small businesses. Participants noted that the labor market remained tight, but demand and supply in that market had continued to come into better balance. Payroll growth had remained strong in the last few months of 2023 but had slowed from its pace seen a year ago, while the unemployment rate remained low. Participants also observed that the ratio of job openings to unemployed workers had de- clined over the past year but still remained somewhat above its pre-pandemic level. Consistent with a reduc- tion in labor market tightness, business contacts in sev- eral Districts reported an easing in wage pressures or an increased ability to hire and retain workers. Participants mentioned several developments that had boosted labor supply last year, including higher labor force participa- tion, immigration, and an improved job-matching pro- cess; however, a few participants judged that further in- creases in labor supply may be limited, pointing, for in- stance, to the decline in labor force participation in De- cember. While labor market conditions were generally seen as strong, several participants noted that recent job gains were concentrated in a few sectors, which, in their view, pointed to downside risks to the outlook for em- ployment. Participants discussed the uncertainty surrounding the economic outlook. As an upside risk to both inflation and economic activity, participants noted that momen- tum in aggregate demand may be stronger than currently assessed, especially in light of surprisingly resilient con- sumer spending last year. Furthermore, several partici- pants mentioned the risk that financial conditions were or could become less restrictive than appropriate, which could add undue momentum to aggregate demand and cause progress on inflation to stall. Participants also noted some other sources of upside risks to inflation, in- cluding possible disruptions to supply chains from geo- political developments, a potential rebound in core goods prices as the effects of supply-side improvements dissipate, or the possibility that wage growth remains el- evated. Downside risks to inflation and economic activ- ity noted by participants included geopolitical risks that could result in a material pullback in demand, possible negative spillovers from lower growth in some foreign economies, the risk that financial conditions could re- main restrictive for too long, or the possibility that a weakening of household balance sheets could contribute to a greater-than-expected deceleration in consumption. A few participants mentioned the possibility that eco- nomic activity could surprise to the upside and inflation to the downside because of more-favorable-than-ex- pected supply-side developments. In the discussion of financial stability, participants ob- served that risks to the banking system had receded no- tably since last spring, though they noted vulnerabilities at some banks that they assessed warranted monitoring. These participants noted potential risks for some banks associated with increased funding costs, significant reli- ance on uninsured deposits, unrealized losses on assets Page 8 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ resulting from the rise in longer-term interest rates, or high CRE exposures. Participants judged that liquidity in the financial system remained more than ample and discussed the importance of considering liquidity condi- tions as the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet continues to normalize. While participants noted that they were not seeing any signs of liquidity pressures at banks, several participants noted that, as a matter of prudent contin- gency planning, banks should continue to improve their readiness to use the Federal Reserve’s discount window, and that the Federal Reserve should continue to improve the operational efficiency of the window. In addition, some participants commented on the difficulties associ- ated with banks relying on some forms of private whole- sale funding during times of stress. A few participants remarked on the importance of measures aimed at in- creasing the resilience of the Treasury market. A few participants noted cyber risks and the importance of firms being able to recover from cyber events. A few participants also commented on the financial condition of low- and moderate-income households who have ex- hausted their savings, as well as the importance of mon- itoring data on rising delinquencies on credit cards and autos. In their consideration of appropriate monetary policy ac- tions at this meeting, participants noted that recent indi- cators suggested that economic activity had been ex- panding at a solid pace. Job gains had moderated since early last year but remained strong, and the unemploy- ment rate had remained low. Inflation had eased over the past year but remained elevated. Participants also noted that the risks to achieving the Committee’s em- ployment and inflation goals were moving into better balance and that the Committee remained highly atten- tive to inflation risks. Participants continued to be reso- lute in their commitment to bring inflation down to the Committee’s 2 percent objective. In light of current economic conditions and their impli- cations for the outlook for economic activity and infla- tion, as well as the balance of risks, all participants judged it appropriate to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 5¼ to 5½ percent at this meeting. All par- ticipants also judged it appropriate to continue the pro- cess of reducing the Federal Reserve’s securities hold- ings, as described in the previously announced Plans for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve’s Balance Sheet. Participants viewed maintaining the current stance of policy as appropriate given the incoming data, which in- dicated that inflation had continued to move toward the Committee’s 2 percent objective and that demand and supply in the labor market had continued to move into better balance. Participants commented that maintain- ing the target range for the federal funds rate at this meeting would promote further progress toward the Committee’s goals and allow participants to gather addi- tional information to evaluate this progress. In discussing the policy outlook, participants judged that the policy rate was likely at its peak for this tightening cycle. They pointed to the decline in inflation seen dur- ing 2023 and to growing signs of demand and supply coming into better balance in product and labor markets as informing that view. Participants generally noted that they did not expect it would be appropriate to reduce the target range for the federal funds rate until they had gained greater confidence that inflation was moving sus- tainably toward 2 percent. Many participants remarked that the Committee’s past policy actions and ongoing improvements in supply conditions were working to- gether to move supply and demand into better balance. Participants noted that the future path of the policy rate would depend on incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. Several participants empha- sized the importance of continuing to communicate clearly about the Committee’s data-dependent approach. In discussing risk-management considerations that could bear on the policy outlook, participants remarked that while the risks to achieving the Committee’s em- ployment and inflation goals were moving into better balance, they remained highly attentive to inflation risks. In particular, they saw upside risks to inflation as having diminished but noted that inflation was still above the Committee’s longer-run goal. Some participants noted the risk that progress toward price stability could stall, particularly if aggregate demand strengthened or supply- side healing slowed more than expected. Participants highlighted the uncertainty associated with how long a restrictive monetary policy stance would need to be maintained. Most participants noted the risks of moving too quickly to ease the stance of policy and emphasized the importance of carefully assessing incoming data in judging whether inflation is moving down sustainably to 2 percent. A couple of participants, however, pointed to downside risks to the economy associated with main- taining an overly restrictive stance for too long. Participants observed that the continuing process of re- ducing the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet was an important part of the Committee’s overall ap- proach to achieving its macroeconomic objectives and that balance sheet runoff had so far proceeded smoothly. In light of ongoing reductions in usage of the ON RRP _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Minutes of the Meeting of January 30–31, 2024 Page 9 facility, many participants suggested that it would be ap- propriate to begin in-depth discussions of balance sheet issues at the Committee’s next meeting to guide an even- tual decision to slow the pace of runoff. Some partici- pants remarked that, given the uncertainty surrounding estimates of the ample level of reserves, slowing the pace of runoff could help smooth the transition to that level of reserves or could allow the Committee to continue balance sheet runoff for longer. In addition, a few par- ticipants noted that the process of balance sheet runoff could continue for some time even after the Committee begins to reduce the target range for the federal funds rate. Committee Policy Actions In their discussions of monetary policy for this meeting, members agreed that economic activity had been ex- panding at a solid pace. Job gains had moderated since early last year but remained strong, and the unemploy- ment rate had remained low. Inflation had eased over the past year but remained elevated. Members judged that the risks to achieving the Committee’s employment and inflation goals were moving into better balance. Members viewed the economic outlook to be uncertain and agreed that they remained highly attentive to infla- tion risks. In support of the Committee’s goals to achieve maxi- mum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run, members agreed to maintain the tar- get range for the federal funds rate at 5¼ to 5½ percent. Members concurred that, in considering any adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, they would carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. Members agreed that they did not expect that it would be appropriate to reduce the target range until they have gained greater confidence that in- flation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent. In addi- tion, members agreed to continue to reduce the Federal Reserve’s holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities, as de- scribed in its previously announced plans. All members affirmed their strong commitment to returning inflation to the Committee’s 2 percent objective. Members agreed that, in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, they would continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. They would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals. Mem- bers also agreed that their assessments would take into account a wide range of information, including readings on labor market conditions, inflation pressures and in- flation expectations, and financial and international de- velopments. Given that the stresses that emerged at some banks early last year have subsided, members agreed to remove from the statement the reference to the resilience of the U.S. banking system as well as to tighter financial and credit conditions and their effects on the economic outlook. Members also agreed to note the progress made toward the 2 percent inflation objective and the resilience of economic activity over the past year by stating that the Committee “judges that the risks to achieving its em- ployment and inflation goals are moving into better bal- ance.” Regarding considerations relevant for future pol- icy actions, members agreed, given their assessment of the policy rate being likely at its peak for this tightening cycle, to remove the reference to “the extent of any ad- ditional policy firming that may be appropriate to return inflation to 2 percent over time,” as was included in the December statement. In its place, they agreed to adopt phrasing referencing their “considering any adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate.” Members also agreed that the statement should convey that “the Committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks” and that it “does not expect it will be appropriate to reduce the tar- get range until it has gained greater confidence that in- flation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent.” At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the following domestic policy directive, for release at 2:00 p.m.: “Effective February 1, 2024, the Federal Open Market Committee directs the Desk to: • Undertake open market operations as nec- essary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of 5¼ to 5½ percent. • Conduct standing overnight repurchase agreement operations with a minimum bid rate of 5.5 percent and with an aggregate operation limit of $500 billion. • Conduct standing overnight reverse repur- chase agreement operations at an offering rate of 5.3 percent and with a per-counter- party limit of $160 billion per day. Page 10 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ • Roll over at auction the amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s hold- ings of Treasury securities maturing in each calendar month that exceeds a cap of $60 billion per month. Redeem Treasury coupon securities up to this monthly cap and Treasury bills to the extent that coupon principal payments are less than the monthly cap. • Reinvest into agency mortgage-backed se- curities (MBS) the amount of principal pay- ments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of agency debt and agency MBS received in each calendar month that exceeds a cap of $35 billion per month. • Allow modest deviations from stated amounts for reinvestments, if needed for operational reasons. • Engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settle- ment of the Federal Reserve’s agency MBS transactions.” The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below for release at 2:00 p.m.: “Recent indicators suggest that economic activ- ity has been expanding at a solid pace. Job gains have moderated since early last year but remain strong, and the unemployment rate has re- mained low. Inflation has eased over the past year but remains elevated. The Committee seeks to achieve maximum em- ployment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. The Committee judges that the risks to achieving its employment and infla- tion goals are moving into better balance. The economic outlook is uncertain, and the Com- mittee remains highly attentive to inflation risks. In support of its goals, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 5¼ to 5½ percent. In considering any adjustments to the target range for the fed- eral funds rate, the Committee will carefully as- sess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. The Committee does not expect it will be appropriate to reduce the target range until it has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 per- cent. In addition, the Committee will continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage-backed secu- rities, as described in its previously announced plans. The Committee is strongly committed to returning inflation to its 2 percent objective. In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals. The Committee’s assessments will take into account a wide range of information, in- cluding readings on labor market conditions, in- flation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.” Voting for this action: Jerome H. Powell, John C. Williams, Thomas I. Barkin, Michael S. Barr, Raphael W. Bostic, Michelle W. Bowman, Lisa D. Cook, Mary C. Daly, Philip N. Jefferson, Adriana D. Kugler, Loretta J. Mester, and Christopher J. Waller. Voting against this action: None. Consistent with the Committee’s decision to leave the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted unanimously to maintain the interest rate paid on reserve balances at 5.4 percent, effective Febru- ary 1, 2024. The Board of Governors of the Federal Re- serve System voted unanimously to approve the estab- lishment of the primary credit rate at the existing level of 5.5 percent, effective February 1, 2024. It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Tuesday–Wednesday, March 19– 20, 2024. The meeting adjourned at 10:25 a.m. on Janu- ary 31, 2024. Notation Vote By notation vote completed on January 2, 2024, the Committee unanimously approved the minutes of the Committee meeting held on December 12–13, 2023. _______________________ Joshua Gallin Secretary _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Minutes of the Meeting of January 30–31, 2024 Page 11"}

Wood, Special Adviser to the Board, Division of Board Members, Board Egon Zakrajsek, Executive Vice President, Federal Reserve Bank of Boston Rebecca Zarutskie, Special Adviser to the Board, Division of Board Members, Board Developments in Financial Markets and Open Market Operations The manager turned first to a review of developments in financial markets over the intermeeting period. U.S. fi- nancial conditions had eased modestly since the January FOMC meeting, with higher equity prices more than off- setting increases in interest rates. Nominal Treasury yields had risen over the intermeeting period. At shorter maturities, most of the increase was attributable to a rise in inflation compensation, prompted by indications that the decline in inflation was proceeding somewhat more slowly than markets in recent months had been expect- ing. In contrast, at longer maturities, much of the in- crease in Treasury yields was due to a rise in real rates, reflecting solid labor market readings and stronger-than- expected data on economic activity. The manager turned next to policy rate expectations. An estimate of the expected federal funds rate path derived from futures prices shifted up significantly over the in- termeeting period. The modal federal funds rate path implied by options prices had also risen, but by substan- tially less than the futures-implied path. The move up in the futures-implied path reflected in part some shift in expectations toward policy rate cuts beginning later in the year, and cumulating to a smaller rate reduction in 2024, than previously assessed. Investors also appeared to have considerably lowered the perceived probability of more substantial rate cuts than in their baseline ex- pectations. This lowering was evident in significantly more concentrated probability distributions for the fed- eral funds rate over coming quarters. The changes in policy rate expectations over the intermeeting period oc- curred in the wake of stronger economic data, percep- tions that disinflation might be proceeding more slowly than previously thought, and Federal Reserve communi- cations. The median of modal paths of the federal funds rate obtained from the Open Market Desk’s Survey of Primary Dealers and Survey of Market Participants was also slightly higher. Responses still indicated substantial differences among survey participants in their assess- ments of the total amount of rate cuts likely to occur this year. The manager then discussed expectations regarding bal- ance sheet policy. Survey responses reflected judgments that the Committee’s slowing of balance sheet runoff would begin slightly later than previously expected, with the majority of survey participants now expecting the slowing to start around midyear. Balance sheet runoff was expected to continue for some time thereafter, and survey responses suggested a slightly smaller balance sheet size at the end of runoff than respondents had pre- viously assessed. The manager noted that broad equity prices had reached new highs over the intermeeting period. This growth was again driven primarily by the strong increases in val- uations of large-capitalization technology companies, while broader equity price gains were more measured. Recent bank equity price behavior reflected renewed market attention on the challenges faced by the regional banking sector, particularly that sector’s exposures to commercial real estate (CRE). In global financial mar- kets, the expected policy rate path in most advanced for- eign economies (AFEs) shifted up over the intermeeting period. At the end of the intermeeting period, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) announced that it would discontinue its policies of a negative short-term interest rate and yield curve control; this decision was largely expected by in- vestors, and the BOJ’s announcement had a limited ef- fect on global financial markets. Conditions in U.S. money markets had been stable over the intermeeting period, with less upward pressure on repurchase agreement (repo) rates than in recent inter- meeting periods. The usage of the overnight reverse re- purchase agreement (ON RRP) facility had continued to decline, albeit at a somewhat slower pace than that seen over the second half of 2023. Staff projections sug- gested that total ON RRP balances might stabilize in coming months at either zero or a low level. This as- sessment was also supported by information acquired in Desk outreach efforts. The manager provided an update on indicators of re- serve conditions. Over the past few years, rate control had been effective, with the effective federal funds rate being firmly within the Committee’s target range. The Minutes of the Meeting of March 19–20, 2024 Page 3 _____________________________________________________________________________________________ staff assessed that, over the intermeeting period, the fed- eral funds rate continued to be insensitive to day-to-day changes in the supply of reserves. This outcome, to- gether with various other indicators of reserve condi- tions, supported the conclusion that reserves remained abundant. The manager noted that there was neverthe- less significant uncertainty about the demand for re- serves and that, under the current pace of runoff of the Federal Reserve’s securities portfolio, stabilization in to- tal ON RRP balances would, all else equal, cause re- serves to start declining at a rapid rate. By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk’s domestic transactions over the intermeeting period. There were no intervention operations in foreign curren- cies for the System’s account during the intermeeting pe- riod. Considerations for Slowing the Pace of Balance Sheet Reduction Participants began a discussion related to slowing the pace of balance sheet runoff consistent with the Com- mittee’s Plans for Reducing the Size of the Federal Re- serve’s Balance Sheet announced in May 2022. Those plans indicated that in order to ensure a smooth transi- tion, the Committee intends to slow and then stop the decline in the size of the balance sheet when reserve bal- ances are somewhat above the level it judges to be con- sistent with ample reserves. Since balance sheet runoff began in June 2022, the Federal Reserve’s total securities holdings had declined roughly $1.5 trillion. In light of the ongoing sizable decline in the balance sheet, and the prospect of a more rapid decline in reserve balances, par- ticipants agreed that their discussions at this meeting would help inform the Committee’s future decisions re- garding how and when to slow the pace of runoff. No decisions about adjusting the pace of balance sheet run- off were made at the meeting. The participants’ discussion was preceded by staff presentations. The staff reviewed the 2017–19 balance sheet runoff episode and the lessons learned from that experience, including the importance of monitoring money market conditions in light of the uncertainty sur- rounding the level of reserves consistent with operating in an ample-reserves regime. The staff presented a set of simulations in which the current monthly pace of se- curities runoff was reduced to illustrate how the choice of when to start slowing the pace of runoff could affect the paths for the balance sheet and reserve balances. The simulations showed how various options for when to slow the pace of runoff could affect the duration of each of the expected phases of the transition to an ample level of reserves. Participants observed that balance sheet runoff was pro- ceeding smoothly. Nevertheless, taking into account the experience around the end of the 2017–19 balance sheet runoff episode, participants broadly assessed it would be appropriate to take a cautious approach to further run- off. The vast majority of participants thus judged it would be prudent to begin slowing the pace of runoff fairly soon. Most of these participants noted that, de- spite significant balance sheet reduction, reserve bal- ances had remained elevated because the decline in usage of the ON RRP facility had shifted Federal Reserve lia- bilities toward reserves. However, with the extent of fu- ture declines in ON RRP take-up becoming more lim- ited, further balance sheet runoff will likely translate more directly into declines in reserve balances, poten- tially at a rapid pace. In light of the uncertainty regarding the level of reserves consistent with operating in an am- ple-reserves regime, slowing the pace of balance sheet runoff sooner rather than later would help facilitate a smooth transition from abundant to ample reserve bal- ances. Slower runoff would give the Committee more time to assess market conditions as the balance sheet continues to shrink. It would allow banks, and short- term funding markets more generally, additional time to adjust to the lower level of reserves, thus reducing the probability that money markets experience undue stress that could require an early end to runoff. Therefore, the decision to slow the pace of runoff does not mean that the balance sheet will ultimately shrink by less than it would otherwise. Rather, a slower pace of runoff would facilitate ongoing declines in securities holdings con- sistent with reaching ample reserves. A few participants, however, indicated that they preferred to continue with the current pace of balance sheet runoff until market in- dicators begin to show signs that reserves are approach- ing an ample level. All participants emphasized the im- portance of communicating that a decision to slow the pace of runoff would have no implications for the stance of monetary policy, as it would mean implementing one of the transitional steps previously announced in the Committee’s balance sheet plans. In their discussions regarding how to adjust the pace of runoff, participants generally favored reducing the monthly pace of runoff by roughly half from the recent overall pace. With redemptions of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) expected to continue to run well below the current monthly cap, par- ticipants saw little need to adjust this cap, which also would be consistent with the Committee’s intention to Page 4 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ hold primarily Treasury securities in the longer run. Ac- cordingly, participants generally preferred to maintain the existing cap on agency MBS and adjust the redemp- tion cap on U.S. Treasury securities to slow the pace of balance sheet runoff. Participants also shared their initial perspectives on longer-term aspects of balance sheet policy beyond the more immediate issues concerning slowing the pace of runoff. Although they saw the current level of reserves as abundant, participants emphasized the underlying un- certainty about the level of reserves consistent with op- erating in an ample-reserves regime. They noted various price and quantity metrics that they saw as important real-time indicators of conditions in short-term funding markets that could provide signals that reserves are ap- proaching a level somewhat above ample. Some partic- ipants also mentioned the importance of both the dis- count window and the standing repo facility as liquidity backstops as reserves decline. Many participants com- mented on aspects of the composition of the Federal Re- serve’s securities holdings, including the appropriate longer-run maturity composition of the System Open Market Account portfolio and options to achieve in the longer run a portfolio that consists primarily of Treasury securities. Staff Review of the Economic Situation The information available at the time of the March 19– 20 meeting suggested that U.S. real gross domestic prod- uct (GDP) was expanding at a solid rate in the first quar- ter, although slower than its robust fourth-quarter pace. Labor market conditions remained strong in recent months. Consumer price inflation—as measured by the 12-month change in the price index for personal con- sumption expenditures (PCE)—continued to trend down, though it remained above 2 percent. Labor demand and supply appeared to continue to move into better balance, although recent indicators were mixed. Total nonfarm payroll employment increased at a faster average monthly pace over January and February than in the fourth quarter. In contrast, the unemploy- ment rate edged up to 3.9 percent in February, while the labor force participation rate and the employment-to- population ratio were essentially unchanged. The unem- ployment rate for African Americans increased, and the rate for Hispanics was unchanged; both rates were higher than those for Asians and for Whites. The pri- vate-sector job openings rate and the quits rate were little changed in January, and both rates were far below their year-earlier levels. The 12-month change in average hourly earnings for all employees was essentially the same in February as it was at the end of last year, and it remained well below its level a year ago. The Wage Growth Tracker constructed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta was lower over the past two months than readings last year. Consumer price inflation continued to decline, but re- cent progress was uneven. Total PCE prices increased 2.5 percent over the 12 months ending in January, while core PCE price inflation—which excludes changes in energy prices and many consumer food prices—was 2.9 percent over the same period. Both of those 12-month measures continued to trend down, although the month-over-month readings for January had moved up. The trimmed mean measure of 12-month PCE price inflation constructed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas was 3.2 percent in January, lower than its level a year earlier. Over the 12 months ending in February, the consumer price index (CPI) increased 3.2 percent and core CPI rose 3.8 percent; both 12-month measures were below their year-ago levels even though the recent month-over-month CPI readings had firmed a bit. Re- cent survey measures of consumers’ inflation expecta- tions at both shorter- and longer-term horizons were broadly in line with the levels seen in the decade before the pandemic. Recent indicators suggested that real GDP was increas- ing at a solid pace in the first quarter, although more slowly than its robust fourth-quarter rate. Incoming data pointed to some slowing in PCE growth, as expenditures declined in January and the components of the retail sales data used to estimate PCE were soft in February. January’s readings on orders and shipments of nonde- fense capital goods excluding aircraft and on nonresi- dential construction spending suggested some decelera- tion in business fixed investment. In contrast, starts and permits for single-family homes in January and February pointed to a modest pickup in residential investment growth. Real exports of goods stepped down in January relative to December following rapid growth last quar- ter. By contrast, real goods imports picked up in Janu- ary, as higher imports of capital goods and automotive products more than offset lower imports of consumer goods. Overall, the nominal U.S. international trade def- icit widened in January, as goods and services imports expanded more than exports, which increased only slightly. In contrast to strong U.S. GDP growth in the fourth quarter, economic growth in foreign economies was generally weak amid tight monetary policy, the erosion in real household incomes from high inflation, and the Minutes of the Meeting of March 19–20, 2024 Page 5 _____________________________________________________________________________________________ ongoing repercussions of the 2022 energy shock in Eu- rope. More recently, purchasing managers indexes in Europe through February and other indicators provided tentative signs of some firming in the region’s economic activity. In China, economic data for January and Feb- ruary were somewhat mixed. Although exports, invest- ment, and industrial production were strong, household demand remained depressed amid China’s ongoing property-sector slump. On the other hand, some econ- omies in emerging Asia performed well, in part reflecting strong demand for leading-edge semiconductors. Foreign headline inflation picked up early in the year as the downward pressure from previous energy price de- clines waned and some emerging market economies (EMEs) experienced renewed food price pressures due to adverse weather. Most major foreign central banks kept their policy rates unchanged over the intermeeting period and emphasized the need for greater confidence that inflation was falling back to target before easing pol- icy. Staff Review of the Financial Situation Over the intermeeting period, the market-implied path for the federal funds rate through 2024 increased mark- edly, reversing the declines that had occurred since late last year. Consistent with the increase in the implied pol- icy rate path, intermediate- and longer-term Treasury yields moved up over the period, with larger increases concentrated at shorter maturities. Most of the increase in short-term Treasury yields was attributed to a rise in near-term inflation compensation. Market-based measures of near-term interest rate uncertainty for shorter-term yields remained elevated by historical standards, in part reflecting investors’ continued uncer- tainty about the path of policy rates. Despite the rise in interest rates, broad stock price in- dexes increased notably amid upbeat corporate earnings reports, particularly for the largest firms. Yield spreads on investment-grade corporate bonds were little changed, and those on speculative-grade bonds nar- rowed slightly. The one-month option-implied volatility on the S&P 500 index increased slightly over the period but remained low by historical standards. Changes in foreign financial asset prices over the inter- meeting period were largely driven by spillovers from U.S. financial markets. Risk appetite generally improved, leading to increases in foreign equity indexes and a nar- rowing of EME credit spreads. Short-term yields in the AFEs were also boosted by less-accommodative-than- expected communications by European Central Bank officials. Longer-term AFE yields and the broad dollar index were little changed on net. At its meeting on March 19, the BOJ exited negative interest rate policy and increased its overnight policy rate from negative 0.1 percent to a range of 0 to 0.1 percent. This policy rate hike was the first by the BOJ in 17 years. The BOJ also ended its yield curve control policy but indicated that it would continue bond purchases. The changes were widely expected, and market reactions were limited. Conditions in U.S. short-term funding markets remained stable over the intermeeting period. Usage of the ON RRP facility continued to decline. However, the de- cline in average take-up was less than in the two previous periods, suggesting that the rate of decline could be slowing. The continuing decline in ON RRP take-up primarily reflected money market funds’ (MMFs) ongo- ing reallocation of assets to Treasury bills amid contin- ued bill issuance and relatively attractive bill yields. Banks’ total deposit levels edged up further in January and February, likely reflecting, in part, rising nominal in- come and somewhat more competitive deposit rates. MMFs continued to provide relatively attractive yields to investors and experienced modest inflows since the Jan- uary FOMC meeting. In domestic credit markets, over the intermeeting pe- riod, borrowing costs remained elevated. Rates on loans to households generally rose in recent months, including those for 30-year conforming residential mortgages. In- terest rates on credit card offers increased through De- cember, while rates on new auto loans remained elevated through late February, near their recent highs. Yields moved higher on a variety of fixed-income securities, in- cluding commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS), investment- and speculative-grade corporate bonds, and residential MBS. Yields on leveraged loans, which are generally linked to the Secured Overnight Fi- nancing Rate, declined somewhat in line with the nar- rowing of credit spreads. In addition, interest rates on small business loans ticked down in January but re- mained elevated. Credit continued to be available to most businesses, households, and municipalities. Large nonfinancial cor- porations continued to find credit generally accessible. Capital market financing was robust during the inter- meeting period, while commercial and industrial loan balances expanded modestly. For small firms, loan orig- inations were stable despite the tightening of credit standards. Page 6 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Credit in the residential mortgage market remained gen- erally available, although mortgage originations re- mained subdued. Consumer credit remained easily avail- able as credit card balances expanded robustly in January and February, and credit card limits continued to in- crease broadly. Growth in auto lending at finance com- panies was muted in January following robust growth last year. CRE borrowers continued to find credit readily accessi- ble over the period. CRE loans at banks picked up mod- erately in January and February, driven by growth in multifamily and residential loans. Non-agency CMBS is- suance volume was moderate, on average, in January and February. Credit quality for large firms and home mortgage bor- rowers remained solid but generally deteriorated further in sectors such as CRE and credit cards. The trailing six- month default rates on corporate borrowers’ bonds and loans remained low in February. In contrast, credit rat- ing downgrades outpaced upgrades for leveraged loans and corporate bonds in January and February. Credit quality of small businesses deteriorated further in recent months. Mortgage delinquency rates for conventional and De- partment of Veterans Affairs loans were largely un- changed in December and January, but delinquency rates on Federal Housing Administration loans picked up slightly. Credit card delinquency rates increased a bit further in the fourth quarter and stood above levels seen just before the pandemic. The upward trend in the auto delinquency rate appeared to have stopped in the second half of last year, with the delinquency rate in the fourth quarter remaining a little above its pre-pandemic aver- age. Delinquency rates for nonfarm nonresidential loans at banks increased at the end of 2023 to a level last seen in late 2014. The delinquency rate for office properties in CMBS pools continued to increase in January and Feb- ruary. Delinquency rates would have been higher had many borrowers with loans maturing last year not re- ceived extensions. CMBS delinquency rates for most other property types were stable at normal-to-low levels, partly because many of these borrowers were also able to extend their loans when they reached maturity last year. The deterioration in CRE credit quality sparked investor concerns about the health of a few small U.S. and foreign banks over the intermeeting period. Staff Economic Outlook The economic projection prepared by the staff for the March meeting was stronger than the January forecast. The upward revision in the forecast primarily reflected the staff’s incorporation of a higher projected path for population due to a boost from immigration. The lagged effects of earlier monetary policy actions, through their continued contribution to tight financial and credit con- ditions, were still expected to hold output growth in 2024 below the staff’s estimate of potential growth. As those policy effects waned, output was expected to rise in line with potential in 2025 and 2026. The unemploy- ment rate was forecast to remain roughly flat over the next several years. Total and core PCE price inflation were both projected to edge down in 2024, ending the year around 2½ per- cent, as demand and supply in product and labor mar- kets continued to move into better balance. By 2026, total and core PCE price inflation were expected to be close to 2 percent. The staff viewed uncertainty around the baseline projec- tion as close to the average over the past 20 years, as uncertainty was judged to have diminished substantially over the past year. Risks around the inflation forecast were seen as tilted slightly to the upside, as supply-side disruptions—from developments domestically or abroad—or unexpectedly persistent inflation dynamics could materialize. The risks around the forecast for eco- nomic activity were viewed as skewed a little to the downside, as any substantial setback in reducing infla- tion might lead to a tightening of financial conditions that would slow the pace of economic activity by more than the staff anticipated in their baseline forecast. Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, participants submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and infla- tion for each year from 2024 through 2026 and over the longer run. The projections were based on their individ- ual assessments of appropriate monetary policy, includ- ing the path of the federal funds rate. The longer-run projections represented each participant’s assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy. A Summary of Economic Projections was released to the public following the conclusion of the meeting. In their discussion of inflation, participants observed that significant progress had been made over the past Minutes of the Meeting of March 19–20, 2024 Page 7 _____________________________________________________________________________________________ year toward the Committee’s 2 percent inflation objec- tive even though the two most recent monthly readings on core and headline inflation had been firmer than ex- pected. Some participants noted that the recent in- creases in inflation had been relatively broad based and therefore should not be discounted as merely statistical aberrations. However, a few participants noted that re- sidual seasonality could have affected the inflation read- ings at the start of the year. Participants generally com- mented that they remained highly attentive to inflation risks but that they had also anticipated that there would be some unevenness in monthly inflation readings as in- flation returned to target. In their outlook for inflation, participants noted that they continued to expect that inflation would return to 2 percent over the medium term. They remained con- cerned that elevated inflation continued to harm house- holds, especially those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation. A few participants remarked that they expected core non- housing services inflation to decline as the labor market continued to move into better balance and wage growth moderated further. Participants discussed the still- elevated rate of housing services inflation and com- mented on the uncertainty regarding when and by how much lower readings for rent growth on new leases would pass through to this category of inflation. Several participants noted that the disinflationary pressure for core goods that had resulted from the receding of supply chain bottlenecks was likely to moderate. Other factors related to aggregate supply, such as increases in the labor force or better productivity growth, were viewed by sev- eral participants as likely to support continued disinfla- tion. Some participants reported that business contacts had indicated that they were less able to pass on price increases or that consumers were becoming more sensi- tive to price changes. Some participants observed that longer-term inflation expectations appeared to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets. Participants expected that economic growth would slow from last year’s strong pace. With regard to the house- hold sector, participants noted that consumption spend- ing generally remained solid, although many commented that recent readings on retail sales had been soft. Several participants pointed to the strong labor market, ongoing wage gains, and a generally healthy household-sector bal- ance sheet as likely to continue to support consumption. Participants noted mixed reports about the pace of homebuilding amid still-elevated financing costs for de- velopers, despite strong housing demand and a limited supply of affordable housing. Some participants noted that increased immigration, which had likely been boost- ing the growth of personal consumption spending, may also have been adding to the demand for housing. Many participants pointed to indicators such as higher credit card balances, greater use of buy-now-pay-later pro- grams, or rising delinquency rates on some types of con- sumer loans as evidence that the finances of some lower- and moderate-income households might be coming un- der pressure; these developments were seen by these participants as a downside risk to the outlook for con- sumption spending. Reports from business contacts in some industries and Districts conveyed increased optimism about the out- look, while contacts in a couple of other Districts re- ported only a steady or stable pace of economic activity. Restrictive credit conditions were cited by a few partici- pants as restraining sectors such as equipment invest- ment and residential investment. However, several par- ticipants noted that their contacts had reported increased investment in technology or in business process im- provements that were enhancing productive capacity and helping businesses ameliorate the effects of a tight labor market. Manufacturing activity was characterized as stable. A couple of participants noted that high input costs and lower expected commodity prices were weigh- ing on farm incomes. Participants assessed that demand and supply in the la- bor market were continuing to come into better balance, although conditions generally remained tight. Partici- pants noted strong recent payroll growth, while the un- employment rate remained low. Participants cited a va- riety of indicators that suggested some easing in labor market conditions, including declining job vacancies, a lower quits rate, and a reduced ratio of job openings to unemployed workers. Some participants indicated that business contacts had reported less difficulty in hiring or retaining workers. Several participants noted that the better balance between labor supply and demand had contributed to an easing of nominal wage pressures. Nevertheless, some participants observed that portions of the labor market, such as the health-care sector and in less urban areas, remained very tight. Most partici- pants noted that, during the past year, labor supply had been boosted by increased labor force participation as well as by immigration. Participants further commented that recent estimates of greater immigration in the past few years and an overall increase in labor supply could help explain the strength in employment gains even as Page 8 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ the unemployment rate had remained roughly flat and wage pressures had eased. Participants discussed the uncertainties around the eco- nomic outlook. Participants generally noted their uncer- tainty about the persistence of high inflation and ex- pressed the view that recent data had not increased their confidence that inflation was moving sustainably down to 2 percent. Some participants pointed to geopolitical risks that might result in more severe supply bottlenecks or higher shipping costs that could put upward pressure on prices, and observed that those developments could also weigh on economic growth. The possibility that ge- opolitical events or surges in domestic demand could generate increased energy prices was also seen as an up- side risk to inflation. Some participants noted the un- certainties regarding the restrictiveness of financial con- ditions and the associated risk that conditions were or could become less restrictive than desired, which could add momentum to aggregate demand and put upward pressure on inflation. Several participants commented that increased efficiencies and technological innovations had the potential to raise productivity growth, which might allow the economy to grow faster without raising inflation. Participants also noted downside risks to eco- nomic activity, including slowing economic growth in China, a deterioration in conditions in domestic CRE markets, a potential reemergence of stresses in the bank- ing sector, or the possibility that a pickup in layoffs could result in a relatively rapid rise in unemployment. Many participants pointed to the difficulty in assessing how re- cent immigration trends would influence the evolution of labor supply, aggregate demand, and overall eco- nomic activity. In their consideration of monetary policy at this meeting, all participants judged that, in light of current economic conditions, the outlook for economic activity and infla- tion, and the balance of risks, it was appropriate to main- tain the target range for the federal funds rate at 5¼ to 5½ percent. Participants also agreed that it was appro- priate to continue the process of reducing the Federal Reserve’s securities holdings, as described in the previ- ously announced Plans for Reducing the Size of the Fed- eral Reserve’s Balance Sheet. Participants commented that maintaining the current target range for the federal funds rate at this meeting would support the Commit- tee’s progress to return inflation to the 2 percent objec- tive and keep longer-term inflation expectations well an- chored. In discussing the policy outlook, participants judged that the policy rate was likely at its peak for this tightening cycle, and almost all participants judged that it would be appropriate to move policy to a less restrictive stance at some point this year if the economy evolved broadly as they expected. In support of this view, they noted that the disinflation process was continuing along a path that was generally expected to be somewhat uneven. They also pointed to the Committee’s policy actions together with the ongoing improvements in supply conditions as factors working to move supply and demand into better balance. Participants noted indicators pointing to strong economic momentum and disappointing readings on in- flation in recent months and commented that they did not expect it would be appropriate to reduce the target range for the federal funds rate until they had gained greater confidence that inflation was moving sustainably toward 2 percent. Participants remarked that in consid- ering any adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate at future meetings, they would carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. Participants noted the importance of continuing to communicate clearly the Committee’s data-dependent approach in formulating monetary policy and the strong commitment to achieve its dual-mandate objectives of maximum employment and price stability. In discussing risk-management considerations that could bear on the policy outlook, participants generally judged that risks to the achievement of the Committee’s employment and inflation goals were moving into better balance. They remarked that it was important to weigh the risks of maintaining a restrictive stance for too long, which could unduly weaken economic activity and em- ployment, against the risks of easing policy too quickly, which could stall or even reverse progress in returning inflation to the Committee’s 2 percent inflation objec- tive. Regarding the latter risk, participants emphasized the importance of carefully assessing incoming data to judge whether inflation is moving down sustainably to 2 percent. Participants noted various sources of uncer- tainty associated with their outlooks for economic activ- ity, the labor market, and inflation, with some partici- pants additionally mentioning uncertainty about the ex- tent to which past monetary policy actions or the current stance of policy would weigh further on aggregate de- mand. Participants agreed, however, that monetary pol- icy remained well positioned to respond to evolving eco- nomic conditions and risks to the outlook, including the possibility of maintaining the current restrictive policy stance for longer should the disinflation process slow, or reducing policy restraint in the event of an unexpected weakening in labor market conditions. Minutes of the Meeting of March 19–20, 2024 Page 9 _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Committee Policy Actions In their discussions of monetary policy for this meeting, members agreed that economic activity had been ex- panding at a solid pace. Job gains had remained strong, and the unemployment rate had remained low. Inflation had eased over the past year but remained elevated. Members judged that the risks to achieving the Commit- tee’s employment and inflation goals were moving into better balance. Members viewed the economic outlook as uncertain and agreed that they remained highly atten- tive to inflation risks. In support of the Committee’s goals to achieve maxi- mum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run, members agreed to maintain the tar- get range for the federal funds rate at 5¼ to 5½ percent. Members concurred that, in considering any adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, they would carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. Members agreed that they did not expect that it would be appropriate to reduce the target range until they have gained greater confidence that in- flation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent. In addi- tion, members agreed to continue to reduce the Federal Reserve’s holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency MBS, as described in its previously an- nounced plans. All members affirmed their strong com- mitment to returning inflation to the Committee’s 2 per- cent objective. Members agreed that, in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, they would continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. They would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals. Mem- bers also agreed that their assessments would take into account a wide range of information, including readings on labor market conditions, inflation pressures and in- flation expectations, and financial and international de- velopments. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the following domestic policy directive, for release at 2:00 p.m.: “Effective March 21, 2024, the Federal Open Market Committee directs the Desk to:  Undertake open market operations as nec- essary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of 5¼ to 5½ percent.  Conduct standing overnight repurchase agreement operations with a minimum bid rate of 5.5 percent and with an aggregate operation limit of $500 billion.  Conduct standing overnight reverse repur- chase agreement operations at an offering rate of 5.3 percent and with a per-counter- party limit of $160 billion per day.  Roll over at auction the amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s hold- ings of Treasury securities maturing in each calendar month that exceeds a cap of $60 billion per month. Redeem Treasury coupon securities up to this monthly cap and Treasury bills to the extent that coupon principal payments are less than the monthly cap.  Reinvest into agency mortgage-backed se- curities (MBS) the amount of principal pay- ments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of agency debt and agency MBS received in each calendar month that exceeds a cap of $35 billion per month.  Allow modest deviations from stated amounts for reinvestments, if needed for operational reasons.  Engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settle- ment of the Federal Reserve’s agency MBS transactions.” The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below for release at 2:00 p.m.: “Recent indicators suggest that economic activ- ity has been expanding at a solid pace. Job gains have remained strong, and the unemployment rate has remained low. Inflation has eased over the past year but remains elevated. The Committee seeks to achieve maximum em- ployment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. The Committee judges that the risks to achieving its employment and infla- tion goals are moving into better balance. The economic outlook is uncertain, and the Com- mittee remains highly attentive to inflation risks. In support of its goals, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 5¼ to 5½ percent. In considering Page 10 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ any adjustments to the target range for the fed- eral funds rate, the Committee will carefully as- sess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. The Committee does not expect it will be appropriate to reduce the target range until it has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 per- cent. In addition, the Committee will continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage-backed secu- rities, as described in its previously announced plans. The Committee is strongly committed to returning inflation to its 2 percent objective. In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals. The Committee’s assessments will take into account a wide range of information, in- cluding readings on labor market conditions, in- flation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.” Voting for this action: Jerome H. Powell, John C. Williams, Thomas I. Barkin, Michael S. Barr, Raphael W. Bostic, Michelle W. Bowman, Lisa D. Cook, Mary C. Daly, Philip N. Jefferson, Adriana D. Kugler, Loretta J. Mester, and Christopher J. Waller. Voting against this action: None. Consistent with the Committee’s decision to leave the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted unanimously to maintain the interest rate paid on reserve balances at 5.4 percent, effective March 21, 2024. The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted unanimously to approve the establishment of the primary credit rate at the existing level of 5.5 percent, ef- fective March 21, 2024. It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Tuesday–Wednesday, April 30– May 1, 2024. The meeting adjourned at 9:55 a.m. on March 20, 2024. Notation Vote By notation vote completed on February 20, 2024, the Committee unanimously approved the minutes of the Committee meeting held on January 30–31, 2024. _______________________ Joshua Gallin Secretary Minutes of the Meeting of March 19–20, 2024 Page 11 _____________________________________________________________________________________________"}

Domestic data releases over the inter- meeting period pointed to inflation being more persis- tent than previously expected and to a generally resilient economy. Policy expectations shifted materially in re- sponse. The policy rate path derived from futures prices implied fewer than two 25 basis point rate cuts by year- end. The modal path based on options prices was quite flat, suggesting at most one such rate cut in 2024. The median of the modal paths of the federal funds rate ob- tained from the Open Market Desk’s Survey of Primary Dealers and Survey of Market Participants also indicated fewer cuts this year than previously thought. Respond- ents’ baseline expectations for the timing of the first rate cut—which had been concentrated around June in the March surveys—shifted out significantly and became more diffuse. Treasury yields rose materially over the intermeeting pe- riod. At shorter maturities, the increase appeared to largely reflect higher inflation compensation, while at longer maturities, it was attributable mostly to a higher expected path for the real policy rate and higher real risk premiums. Model estimates suggested that inflation ex- pectations rose some, but mostly at shorter horizons. Longer-term inflation expectations appeared to remain well anchored. Broad equity prices fell over the period, as higher interest rates weighed on valuations, while re- cent earnings reports, which were generally solid, pro- vided some support. The dollar strengthened as several foreign central banks were expected to start easing policy before the Federal Reserve. Overall, higher yields and lower equity prices, together with the stronger dollar, re- sulted in a tightening of financial conditions over the pe- riod. The manager then discussed expectations regarding bal- ance sheet policy. Respondents to the Desk surveys ex- pected a slowing in the pace of balance sheet reduction to begin soon; the median respondent projected that the slowdown would start in June, one month earlier than in the March surveys. The average probability distribution of the size of the System Open Market Account (SOMA) portfolio at the end of runoff had become a bit more concentrated, and its probability-weighted mean was slightly lower than in the March surveys. Overall, the survey results suggested that respondents’ expecta- tions for a slowdown of balance sheet runoff had been decoupled from expectations about the timing and ex- tent of rate cuts, and that respondents understood that a slowdown in the pace of runoff was not likely to trans- late to a higher terminal size of the portfolio. The manager then turned to money markets and Desk operations. Unsecured overnight rates were stable over the intermeeting period. In secured funding markets, rates on overnight repurchase agreements firmed some- what over the March quarter-end reporting date, in line with recent history. Market participants generally re- ported that the return of somewhat higher rates around reporting dates had not been associated with any issues in market functioning. Despite the ongoing balance sheet runoff, take-up at the overnight reverse repurchase agreement (ON RRP) facility was largely steady over the period, likely reflecting fewer attractive private-market alternatives for money market funds (MMFs) amid a re- cent reduction in Treasury bills outstanding as well as a decrease in MMFs’ weighted average maturities. ON RRP usage was also likely supported by typical month-end dynamics. The staff and respondents to the Desk’s Survey of Primary Dealers expected ON RRP take-up to decline in coming months. The manager provided an update on reserve conditions. Over the intermeeting period, the federal funds market continued to be insensitive to day-to-day changes in the supply of reserves and suggested that reserves remained abundant. The manager discussed various other indica- tors that supported the same conclusion. The Committee voted unanimously to renew the recip- rocal currency arrangements with the Bank of Canada and the Bank of Mexico; these arrangements are associ- ated with the Federal Reserve’s participation in the North American Framework Agreement of 1994. In ad- dition, the Committee voted unanimously to renew the dollar and foreign currency liquidity swap arrangements with the Bank of Canada, the Bank of England, the Bank of Japan, the European Central Bank, and the Swiss Na- tional Bank. The votes to renew the Federal Reserve’s participation in these standing arrangements occur an- nually at the April or May FOMC meeting. By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk’s domestic transactions over the intermeeting period. There were no intervention operations in foreign curren- cies for the System’s account during the intermeeting pe- riod. Staff Review of the Economic Situation The information available at the time of the April 30– May 1 meeting indicated that growth in U.S. real gross domestic product (GDP) stepped down in the first quar- ter of 2024 from the robust pace seen over the second _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Minutes of the Meeting of April 30–May 1, 2024 Page 3 half of 2023. Labor market conditions remained strong. Consumer price inflation—as measured by the 12-month change in the price index for personal con- sumption expenditures (PCE)—slowed significantly over the past year but had moved up slightly in recent months and remained above 2 percent. Labor demand and supply continued to move into better balance, though the speed of this realignment appeared to have slowed in recent months. Total nonfarm payroll employment increased at a faster average monthly pace in the first quarter of 2024 than in the fourth quarter of 2023. The unemployment rate ticked down to 3.8 per- cent in March, while the labor force participation rate and the employment-to-population ratio both moved up 0.2 percentage point. The unemployment rate for Afri- can Americans increased, and the rate for Hispanics moved down; both rates were higher than those for Asians and for Whites. The 12-month changes in the employment cost index (ECI) and average hourly earn- ings for all employees both declined in March relative to a year earlier, but the 3-month change in the ECI stepped up noticeably from the average pace that pre- vailed over the second half of 2023. Regarding consumer price inflation, total PCE prices in- creased 2.7 percent over the 12 months ending in March, while core PCE price inflation—which excludes changes in energy prices and many consumer food prices—was 2.8 percent over the same period. Both inflation measures were considerably lower than their year-earlier levels but had surprised to the upside. Although some measures of short-term inflation expectations had moved up, longer-term expectations were little changed and stood at levels consistent with those that prevailed before the pandemic. According to the advance estimate, real GDP rose mod- estly in the first quarter. However, private domestic final purchases (PDFP)—which comprises PCE and private fixed investment and which often provides a better sig- nal than GDP of underlying economic momentum— posted an increase that was similar to the solid gains seen over the second half of 2023. Real exports of goods and services grew at a tepid pace overall in the first quarter, with gains in exports of foods, consumer goods, and capital goods being mostly offset by declines in exports of industrial supplies. By contrast, real imports rose at a brisk pace, boosted in part by a large increase in imports of capital goods. All told, net exports made a significant negative contribution to U.S. GDP growth in the first quarter. Foreign GDP growth is estimated to have picked up in the first quarter from its subdued pace in the previous quarter. In Europe, economic activity resumed expand- ing following modest contractions in several economies amid monetary policy restraint and the repercussions of the 2022 energy shock. Growth stepped up in China, led by strong exports, but property-sector indicators re- mained weak. Elsewhere in emerging Asia, exports re- bounded further from last year’s lows, lifted by robust global demand for high-tech goods. Headline inflation eased modestly further in the ad- vanced foreign economies (AFEs) in the first quarter, but inched up in the emerging market economies in part because of food price pressure caused by adverse weather in some countries. Most major AFE central banks kept their policy rates unchanged over the inter- meeting period, and some reiterated that policy rate cuts could be appropriate at coming meetings. Staff Review of the Financial Situation Over the intermeeting period, the market-implied path for the federal funds rate through 2024 increased mark- edly, and federal funds futures rates suggested that mar- ket participants were placing lower odds on significant policy easing in 2024 than they did just before the March FOMC meeting. Consistent with the rise in the implied policy path, nominal Treasury yields at all maturities also rose substantially as investors appeared to reassess the persistence of inflation and the implications for mone- tary policy. Market-based measures of interest rate un- certainty remained elevated by historical standards. Broad stock price indexes declined moderately, on net, over the intermeeting period. Yield spreads on invest- ment-grade corporate bonds were about unchanged, and those on speculative-grade corporate bonds increased moderately. The one-month option-implied volatility on the S&P 500 increased significantly over the period, ap- parently reflecting rising geopolitical tensions, but re- mained at moderate levels by historical standards. Over the intermeeting period, incoming foreign eco- nomic data and central bank communications were largely consistent with market participants’ expectations that most AFE central banks will lower policy rates at coming meetings. Nonetheless, AFE sovereign bond yields rose, primarily reflecting spillovers from higher U.S. yields. Wider U.S.–AFE yield differentials and, to a lesser extent, heightened geopolitical tensions in the Middle East contributed to a moderate increase in the broad dollar index. Though geopolitical tensions weighed on risk sentiment at times, prices of foreign risky assets were little changed on balance. Page 4 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Conditions in U.S. short-term funding markets remained stable over the intermeeting period, with typical dynam- ics observed surrounding quarter-end. Usage of the ON RRP facility leveled off during the first few weeks of the period, primarily reflecting MMFs slowing their re-allocation into Treasury bills. In domestic credit markets, borrowing costs generally rose somewhat over the intermeeting period from al- ready elevated levels. Rates on 30-year conforming res- idential mortgages increased and remained near recent high levels. In contrast, interest rates on new credit card offers edged down in February. Interest rates on small business loans increased in March and remained at ele- vated levels. Meanwhile, price terms for commercial and industrial (C&I) loans were little changed, on net, in the first quarter of 2024 after several quarters of tightening. Yields rose on a broad array of fixed-income securities, including commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS), investment- and speculative-grade corporate bonds, and residential mortgage-backed securities. Financing through capital markets and nonbank lenders was readily accessible for public corporations and large and middle-market private corporations, and credit availability for leveraged loan borrowers appeared to im- prove further over the intermeeting period. For small firms, the volume of loan originations ticked up in Feb- ruary despite the tightening of credit standards. Mean- while, C&I loan balances declined in the first quarter, in line with the cumulative tightening in standards over the past two years. In the April Senior Loan Officer Opin- ion Survey on Bank Lending Practices (SLOOS), large banks kept standards and most lending terms for C&I loans unchanged, on net, while smaller banks con- tinued to tighten standards and terms on net. Banks reported tightening standards further in the April SLOOS for all loan categories of commercial real estate (CRE) loans. The growth of bank CRE loan balances slowed notably over the past year, reflecting the tighten- ing of credit standards over this period, though growth of CRE loan balances picked up modestly in the first quarter. Credit remained available for most consumers, despite some signs of recent tightening. For residential real es- tate borrowers, conforming and government-backed loans remained generally available. Credit card balances continued to grow at a robust pace, though a significant net share of SLOOS respondents indicated that lending standards for credit cards tightened further in the first quarter. Growth in auto lending moderated in January and February, and a modest net share of banks reported in the SLOOS that they tightened lending standards on auto loans in the first quarter. Although credit quality for household loans remained solid, on balance, delinquency rates for credit cards and auto loans in the fourth quarter remained notably above their levels just before the pandemic. For residential mortgages, delinquency rates across loan types were largely unchanged in February. The credit quality of nonfinancial firms borrowing in the corporate bond and leveraged loan markets remained stable overall. The av- erage delinquency rate for loans in CMBS pools ticked down in March but remained at elevated levels. Mean- while, the share of nonperforming CRE loans at banks—defined as loans past due 90 days or in nonac- crual status—rose further through March, especially for loans secured by office buildings. The staff provided an update on its assessment of the stability of the U.S. financial system. On balance, the staff continued to characterize the system’s financial vul- nerabilities as notable but raised the assessment of vul- nerabilities in asset valuations to elevated, as valuations across a range of markets appeared high relative to risk- adjusted cash flows. House prices remained elevated rel- ative to fundamentals such as rents and Treasury yields, though the fraction of mortgage borrowers with small equity positions remained low. CRE prices continued to decline, especially in the multifamily and office sectors, and vacancy rates in these sectors remained elevated. Vulnerabilities associated with business and household debt were characterized as moderate. Nonfinancial busi- ness leverage was high, but the ability of firms to service their debt remained solid, partly due to robust earnings. Leverage in the financial sector was characterized as no- table. Regulatory capital ratios in the banking sector re- mained high. However, the fair value of bank assets was estimated to have fallen further in the first quarter, re- flecting the substantial duration risk on bank balance sheets. For the nonbank sector, the prevalence of the basis trade by hedge funds appeared to have declined from its peak but remained elevated by historical stand- ards. Funding risks were also characterized as notable. Assets in prime MMFs and other cash management vehicles continued to grow steadily. The staff assessed that the financial stability risks associated with the fast-growing private credit sector were limited so far because of the modest leverage used by private debt funds and business development companies and the limited maturity mis- match present in their funding vehicles. However, the staff also noted the growing connections between _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Minutes of the Meeting of April 30–May 1, 2024 Page 5 private credit and the banking sector, the growth of some forms of private credit, and the fact that the private credit market has yet to experience a severe credit down- turn. Staff Economic Outlook The economic forecast prepared by the staff for the April–May meeting was similar to the March projection. The economy was expected to maintain its high rate of resource utilization over the next few years, with pro- jected output growth roughly similar to the staff’s esti- mate of potential growth. The unemployment rate was expected to edge down slightly over 2024 as labor mar- ket functioning improved further, and to remain roughly steady thereafter. Total and core PCE price inflation were both projected to move lower this year relative to last year, though the expected pace of disinflation was slower than in the March projection, as incoming data pointed to more per- sistence in inflation in coming months. Inflation was expected to decline further beyond this year as demand and supply in product and labor markets continued to move into better balance; by 2026, total and core PCE price inflation were expected to be close to 2 percent. The staff continued to view the uncertainty around the baseline projection as close to the average over the past 20 years. Risks to the inflation forecast were seen as tilted to the upside, reflecting the possibility that supply- side disruptions or unexpectedly persistent inflation dy- namics could materialize. The risks around the forecast for economic activity were seen as skewed to the down- side on the grounds that more-persistent inflation could result in tighter financial conditions than in the staff’s baseline projection; in addition, deteriorating household financial positions, especially for lower-income house- holds, might prove to be a larger drag on activity than the staff anticipated. Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook Participants observed that while inflation had eased over the past year, in recent months there had been a lack of further progress toward the Committee’s 2 percent ob- jective. The recent monthly data had showed significant increases in components of both goods and services price inflation. In particular, inflation for core services excluding housing had moved up in the first quarter compared with the fourth quarter of last year, and prices of core goods posted their first three-month increase in several months. In addition, housing services inflation had slowed less than had been anticipated based on the smaller increases in measures of market rents over the past year. A few participants remarked that unusually large seasonal patterns could have contributed to Janu- ary’s large increase in PCE inflation, and several partici- pants noted that some components that typically display volatile price changes had boosted recent readings. However, some participants emphasized that the recent increases in inflation had been relatively broad based and therefore should not be overly discounted. Participants generally commented that they remained highly attentive to inflation risks. They also remained concerned that elevated inflation continued to harm the purchasing power of households, especially those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation. Participants noted that they continued to expect that in- flation would return to 2 percent over the medium term. However, recent data had not increased their confidence in progress toward 2 percent and, accordingly, had sug- gested that the disinflation process would likely take longer than previously thought. Participants discussed several factors that, in conjunction with appropriately re- strictive monetary policy, could support the return of in- flation to the Committee’s goal over time. One was a further reduction in housing services price inflation as lower readings for rent growth on new leases continued to pass through to this category of inflation. However, many participants commented that the pass-through would likely take place only gradually or noted that a re- acceleration of market rents could reduce the effect. Several participants stated that core nonhousing services price inflation could resume its decline as wage growth slows further with labor demand and supply moving into better balance, aided by higher labor force participation and strong immigration flows. In addition, many partic- ipants commented that ongoing increases in productivity growth would support disinflation if sustained, though the outlook for productivity growth was regarded as un- certain. Several participants said that business contacts in their Districts reported increased difficulty in raising their output prices, while a few participants reported a continued ability of firms in their Districts to pass on higher costs to consumers. Although some measures of short-term inflation expectations from surveys of con- sumers had increased in recent months, medium- and longer-term measures of expected inflation had re- mained well anchored, which was seen as crucial for meeting the Committee’s inflation goal on a sustained basis. While supply chain improvements had supported disinflation for goods prices over the previous year, par- ticipants commented that an expected more gradual pace of such improvements could slow progress on Page 6 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ inflation. Several participants commented that growth of aggregate demand would likely have to slow from its strong pace in recent quarters for inflation to move sus- tainably toward the Committee’s goal. Participants assessed that demand and supply in the la- bor market, on net, were continuing to come into better balance, though at a slower rate. Nevertheless, they saw conditions as having generally remained tight amid re- cent strong payroll growth and a still-low unemployment rate. Participants cited a variety of indicators that sug- gested some easing in labor market tightness, including declining job vacancies, a lower quits rate, and a reduced ratio of job openings to unemployed workers. Some participants indicated that business contacts had re- ported less difficulty in hiring or retaining workers, al- though contacts in several Districts continued to report tight labor conditions, especially in the health care and construction sectors. Many participants commented that the better balance between labor demand and sup- ply had contributed to an easing of nominal wage pres- sures. Even so, a number of participants noted that some measures of labor cost growth, including the ECI, had not eased in recent months, and a couple of participants remarked that negotiated compensation agreements had added to wage pressures in their Districts. Many partic- ipants noted that, during the past year, labor supply had been boosted by increased labor force participation rates as well as by immigration. Participants further com- mented that recent estimates of greater immigration in the past few years and an overall increase in labor supply could help explain the strength in employment gains even as the unemployment rate had remained roughly flat and wage pressures had eased. Participants noted that recent indicators suggested that economic activity had continued to expand at a solid pace. Real GDP growth in the first quarter had moder- ated relative to the second half of last year, but PDFP growth maintained a strong pace. High interest rates appeared to weigh on consumer durables purchases in the first quarter, and growth of business fixed invest- ment remained modest. Despite the high interest rates, residential investment grew more strongly in the first quarter than its modest pace in the second half of last year. Although recent PDFP data suggested continued strong economic momentum, participants generally did not in- terpret the data as indicating a further acceleration of ac- tivity and expected that GDP growth would slow from last year’s strong pace. A number of participants com- mented that high rates of immigration could support economic activity by boosting labor supply and contrib- uting to aggregate demand. Participants noted the im- portant influence of productivity growth for the eco- nomic outlook. Some participants suggested that the re- cent increase in productivity growth might not persist because it reflected one-time adjustments to the level of productivity or reflected continued elevated volatility in the data over the past several years. A few participants commented that higher productivity growth might be sustained by the incorporation of technologies such as artificial intelligence into existing business operations or by high rates of new business formation in the technol- ogy sector. In their discussion of the outlook for the household sec- tor, participants observed that consumer spending re- mained firm in the first quarter, supported by low unem- ployment and solid income growth. A number of par- ticipants judged that consumption growth was likely to moderate this year, as growth in labor income was ex- pected to slow and the financial positions of many households were expected to weaken. Many participants noted signs that the finances of low- and moderate-in- come households were increasingly coming under pres- sure, which these participants saw as a downside risk to the outlook for consumption. They pointed to increased usage of credit cards and buy-now-pay-later services, as well as increased delinquency rates for some types of consumer loans. In addition, elevated housing costs were adding to financial strains for lower-income house- holds. A couple of participants noted that financial con- ditions appeared favorable for wealthier households, which account for a large portion of aggregate consump- tion, with hefty wealth gains resulting from recent equity and house price increases. Business contacts in many Districts reported a steady or stable pace of economic activity, while contacts in a cou- ple of Districts conveyed increased optimism about the outlook. A few participants noted that government spending was supporting business expansion in their Districts. Consistent with a solid outlook for businesses, a couple of participants noted that their contacts had re- ported increased investment in technology or in business process improvements that were enhancing productive capacity. Regarding the agricultural sector, a couple of participants noted that lower commodity prices were weighing on farm incomes. Participants discussed the risks and uncertainties around the economic outlook. They generally noted their un- certainty about the persistence of inflation and agreed that recent data had not increased their confidence that _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Minutes of the Meeting of April 30–May 1, 2024 Page 7 inflation was moving sustainably toward 2 percent. Some participants pointed to geopolitical events or other factors resulting in more severe supply bottlenecks or higher shipping costs, which could put upward pressure on prices and weigh on economic growth. The possibil- ity that geopolitical events could generate commodity price increases was also seen as an upside risk to infla- tion. A number of participants noted uncertainty regard- ing the degree of restrictiveness of current financial con- ditions and the associated risk that such conditions were insufficiently restrictive on aggregate demand and infla- tion. Several participants commented that increased ef- ficiencies and technological innovations could raise productivity growth on a sustained basis, which might allow the economy to grow faster without raising infla- tion. Participants also noted downside risks to economic activity, including slowing economic growth in China, a deterioration in conditions in domestic CRE markets, or a sharp tightening in financial conditions. In their discussion of financial stability, participants who commented noted vulnerabilities to the financial system that they assessed warranted monitoring. Participants discussed a range of risks emanating from the banking sector, including unrealized losses on assets resulting from the rise in longer-term yields, high CRE exposure, significant reliance by some banks on uninsured depos- its, cyber threats, or increased financial interconnections among banks. Several participants commented on the rapid growth of private credit markets, noting that such developments should be monitored because the sector was becoming more interconnected with other parts of the financial system and that some associated risks may not yet be apparent. A few participants also commented on the importance of measures aimed at increasing resil- ience in the Treasury market, such as central clearing, or on potential vulnerabilities posed by leveraged investors in the Treasury market. A couple of participants com- mented that the Federal Reserve should continue to im- prove the operational efficiency of the discount window. Participants generally noted that high interest rates could contribute to vulnerabilities in the financial system. In that context, a number of participants emphasized that monetary policy should be guided by the outlook for em- ployment and inflation and that other tools should be the primary means to address financial stability risks. In their consideration of monetary policy at this meeting, all participants judged that, in light of current economic conditions and their implications for the outlook for em- ployment and inflation, as well as the balance of risks, it was appropriate to maintain the target range for the fed- eral funds rate at 5¼ to 5½ percent. Participants assessed that maintaining the current target range for the federal funds rate at this meeting was supported by in- termeeting data indicating continued solid economic growth and a lack of further progress toward the Com- mittee’s 2 percent inflation objective in recent months. Participants also discussed the process of reducing the Federal Reserve’s securities holdings. Participants judged that balance sheet reduction had proceeded smoothly. Almost all participants expressed support for the decision to begin to slow the pace of decline of the Federal Reserve’s securities holdings in June by reducing the monthly redemption cap on Treasury securities from $60 billion to $25 billion, maintaining the monthly re- demption cap on agency debt and agency mort- gage‑backed securities (MBS) at $35 billion, and rein- vesting any principal payments in excess of the $35 bil- lion cap into Treasury securities. A few participants in- dicated that they could have supported a continuation of the current pace of balance sheet runoff at this time or a slightly higher redemption cap on Treasury securities than was decided upon. Various participants empha- sized that the decision to slow the pace of runoff does not have implications for the stance of monetary policy. Several participants also emphasized that slowing the pace of balance sheet runoff did not mean that the bal- ance sheet would ultimately shrink by less than it would otherwise. Some participants commented that slowing the pace of balance sheet runoff would help facilitate a smooth transition from abundant to ample reserve bal- ances by reducing the likelihood that money markets ex- perience undue stress that could require an early end to runoff. Participants generally assessed that it would be important to continue to monitor indicators of reserve conditions as balance sheet runoff continued. In addi- tion, a few participants commented that the existing re- demption cap on agency debt and agency MBS was un- likely to bind at any point over the coming years, but the decision to reinvest any principal payments above that cap into Treasury securities was consistent with the Committee’s longer-run intention to hold a portfolio that consists primarily of Treasury securities. A couple of participants commented that it would be useful to begin discussions regarding the appropriate longer-run maturity composition of the SOMA portfolio. In discussing the policy outlook, participants remarked that the future path of the policy rate would depend on incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. Many participants commented that the public ap- peared to have a good understanding of the Committee’s data-dependent approach in formulating monetary pol- icy and its commitment to achieving its dual-mandate Page 8 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ goals of maximum employment and price stability. Var- ious participants also emphasized the importance of continuing to communicate this message. Participants noted disappointing readings on inflation over the first quarter and indicators pointing to strong economic mo- mentum, and assessed that it would take longer than pre- viously anticipated for them to gain greater confidence that inflation was moving sustainably toward 2 percent. In discussing risk-management considerations that could bear on the policy outlook, participants generally assessed that risks to the achievement of the Commit- tee’s employment and inflation goals had moved toward better balance over the past year. Participants remained highly attentive to inflation risks and noted the uncer- tainty associated with the economic outlook. Although monetary policy was seen as restrictive, many partici- pants commented on their uncertainty about the degree of restrictiveness. These participants saw this uncer- tainty as coming from the possibility that high interest rates may be having smaller effects than in the past, that longer-run equilibrium interest rates may be higher than previously thought, or that the level of potential output may be lower than estimated. Participants assessed, however, that monetary policy remained well positioned to respond to evolving economic conditions and risks to the outlook. Participants discussed maintaining the cur- rent restrictive policy stance for longer should inflation not show signs of moving sustainably toward 2 percent or reducing policy restraint in the event of an unexpected weakening in labor market conditions. Various partici- pants mentioned a willingness to tighten policy further should risks to inflation materialize in a way that such an action became appropriate. Committee Policy Actions In their discussions of monetary policy for this meeting, members agreed that economic activity continued to ex- pand at a solid pace. Job gains remained strong, and the unemployment rate remained low. Inflation eased over the past year but remained elevated. Members also con- curred that, in recent months, there was a lack of further progress toward the Committee’s 2 percent inflation ob- jective and agreed to acknowledge this development in the postmeeting statement. Members judged that the risks to achieving the Committee’s employment and in- flation goals had moved toward better balance over the past year. Members viewed the economic outlook as un- certain and agreed that they remained highly attentive to inflation risks. In support of the Committee’s goals to achieve maxi- mum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run, members agreed to maintain the tar- get range for the federal funds rate at 5¼ to 5½ percent. Members concurred that, in considering any adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, they would carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. Members agreed that they did not expect that it would be appropriate to reduce the target range until they have gained greater confidence that in- flation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent. In addi- tion, members agreed to continue to reduce the Federal Reserve’s holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency MBS. Members decided that, beginning in June, the Committee would slow the pace of decline of its securities holdings by reducing the monthly re- demption cap on Treasury securities from $60 billion to $25 billion. In addition, members decided that the Com- mittee would maintain the monthly redemption cap on agency debt and agency MBS at $35 billion and, begin- ning in June, would reinvest any principal payments in excess of this cap into Treasury securities. All members affirmed their strong commitment to returning inflation to the Committee’s 2 percent objective. Members agreed that, in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, they would continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. They would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerged that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals. Members also agreed that their assessments would take into account a wide range of information, including readings on labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and interna- tional developments. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the following domestic policy directive, for release at 2:00 p.m.: “Effective May 2, 2024, the Federal Open Mar- ket Committee directs the Desk to: • Undertake open market operations as nec- essary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of 5¼ to 5½ percent. • Conduct standing overnight repurchase agreement operations with a minimum bid rate of 5.5 percent and with an aggregate operation limit of $500 billion. • Conduct standing overnight reverse repur- chase agreement operations at an offering _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Minutes of the Meeting of April 30–May 1, 2024 Page 9 rate of 5.3 percent and with a per-counter- party limit of $160 billion per day. • Roll over at auction the amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s hold- ings of Treasury securities maturing in May that exceeds a cap of $60 billion per month. Beginning on June 1, roll over at auction the amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of Treasury se- curities maturing in each calendar month that exceeds a cap of $25 billion per month. Redeem Treasury coupon securities up to these monthly caps and Treasury bills to the extent that coupon principal payments are less than the monthly caps. • Reinvest into agency mortgage-backed se- curities (MBS) the amount of principal pay- ments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of agency debt and agency MBS received in May that exceeds a cap of $35 billion per month. Beginning on June 1, reinvest the amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of agency debt and agency MBS received in each calendar month that exceeds a cap of $35 billion per month into Treasury securities to roughly match the maturity composition of Treas- ury securities outstanding. • Allow modest deviations from stated amounts for reinvestments, if needed for operational reasons. • Engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settle- ment of the Federal Reserve’s agency MBS transactions.” The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below for release at 2:00 p.m.: “Recent indicators suggest that economic activ- ity has continued to expand at a solid pace. Job gains have remained strong, and the unemploy- ment rate has remained low. Inflation has eased over the past year but remains elevated. In re- cent months, there has been a lack of further progress toward the Committee’s 2 percent in- flation objective. The Committee seeks to achieve maximum em- ployment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. The Committee judges that the risks to achieving its employment and infla- tion goals have moved toward better balance over the past year. The economic outlook is un- certain, and the Committee remains highly at- tentive to inflation risks. In support of its goals, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 5¼ to 5½ percent. In considering any adjustments to the target range for the fed- eral funds rate, the Committee will carefully as- sess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. The Committee does not expect it will be appropriate to reduce the target range until it has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 per- cent. In addition, the Committee will continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage‑backed secu- rities. Beginning in June, the Committee will slow the pace of decline of its securities hold- ings by reducing the monthly redemption cap on Treasury securities from $60 billion to $25 billion. The Committee will maintain the monthly redemption cap on agency debt and agency mortgage‑backed securities at $35 bil- lion and will reinvest any principal payments in excess of this cap into Treasury securities. The Committee is strongly committed to returning inflation to its 2 percent objective. In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals. The Committee’s assessments will take into account a wide range of information, in- cluding readings on labor market conditions, in- flation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.” Voting for this action: Jerome H. Powell, John C. Williams, Thomas I. Barkin, Michael S. Barr, Raphael W. Bostic, Michelle W. Bowman, Lisa D. Cook, Mary C. Daly, Philip N. Jefferson, Adriana D. Kugler, Loretta J. Mester, and Christopher J. Waller. Voting against this action: None. Consistent with the Committee’s decision to leave the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged, the Page 10 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted unanimously to maintain the interest rate paid on reserve balances at 5.4 percent, effective May 2, 2024.

Financial conditions eased modestly over the intermeeting period mainly because of higher equity prices. Taking a somewhat longer perspective, the manager noted that financial conditions had changed little since March but eased notably since the fall. The main drivers of that easing were again higher equity prices, which appeared to respond to the reductions in the perceived odds of a recession, and a consensus among market participants that the federal funds rate has reached its peak. Nominal Treasury yields declined moderately across the curve, on net, but continued to be very sensitive to incoming data surprises, especially those pertaining to inflation and the labor market. The net decline in nominal yields over the period was primar- ily due to lower real yields. Inflation compensation also fell somewhat, especially at shorter horizons. Longer- term inflation expectations remained well anchored. The manager turned next to policy rate expectations. The path of the federal funds rate implied by futures prices shifted a bit lower over the intermeeting period and indicated one and one-half 25 basis point cuts by year-end. This shift appeared to reflect mostly changes in perceived risks rather than base-case expectations be- cause the modal path implied by options was virtually unchanged and remained consistent with, at most, one cut this year. The median of modal paths of the federal funds rate obtained from the Open Market Desk’s Sur- vey of Primary Dealers and Survey of Market Partici- pants—taken before the May employment report—was also little changed. The manager then discussed expectations regarding bal- ance sheet policy. Responses to the Desk surveys showed a median expected timing for the end of balance sheet runoff of April 2025, one month later than in the previous surveys, though individual respondents’ views of the exact timing remained dispersed. Respondents’ expectations about the size of the portfolio at the end of runoff had changed little in recent surveys. In international developments, the European Central Bank (ECB) and the Bank of Canada (BOC) initiated rate-cutting cycles this period, as generally expected. Market participants reportedly had not expected easing cycles to begin at the same time across economies but appeared to expect that most advanced-economy central banks will have started easing policy within the next sev- eral months. The manager then turned to money markets and Desk operations. Unsecured overnight rates were stable over the intermeeting period. In secured funding markets, re- purchase agreement (repo) rates remained steady for most of the period but firmed close to the end of May because of month-end pressures and the effect of large settlements of Treasury coupon securities. Rate firm- ness around reporting and settlement dates was con- sistent with historical patterns. Use of the overnight re- verse repurchase agreement (ON RRP) facility remained sensitive to market rates and the availability of alterna- tive investments. Usage was little changed over much of the period but dipped late in the period, coincident with the month-end firming in private repo rates. The staff projected ON RRP usage to decline in coming months, as net Treasury bill issuance was expected to turn posi- tive and private repo rates were expected to continue to move higher relative to administered rates amid large is- suance of Treasury coupon securities. The staff also projected that reserves will not change much in the near term, with the exception of quarter-end dates, and then will decline about in line with the shrinking of the Fed- eral Reserve’s portfolio after ON RRP balances are nearly fully drained. The uncertainty surrounding both projections, however, was considerable. The manager also discussed the responses to a Desk sur- vey question about the most likely spread between the effective federal funds rate and the interest rate on re- serve balances at different levels of the sum of reserves and ON RRP balances. The responses indicated consid- erable uncertainty and dispersion of views about when and how the spread would move as the sum declines. The manager observed that indicators based on market prices and activity were likely the best gauges of how quickly reserves are transitioning from abundant to am- ple. Over the intermeeting period, the federal funds market continued to be insensitive to day-to-day changes in the supply of reserves; various other indicators sug- gested that reserves remained abundant and that the risk of money market strains in the near term was low. By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk’s domestic transactions over the intermeeting period. There were no intervention operations in foreign curren- cies for the System’s account during the intermeeting pe- riod. Staff Review of the Economic Situation The information available at the time of the meeting sug- gested that U.S. economic activity had expanded at a solid pace so far this year. Labor market conditions re- mained solid. Job gains continued to be strong, while the unemployment rate had edged up but was still low. Consumer price inflation was running well below where it was a year earlier, but further progress toward the _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Minutes of the Meeting of June 11–12, 2024 Page 3 Committee’s 2 percent inflation objective had been modest in recent months. Consumer price inflation—as measured by the 12-month change in the price index for personal con- sumption expenditures (PCE)—was about the same in April as at the end of last year, although recent month- over-month readings of PCE prices were lower than ear- lier this year. Total PCE price inflation was 2.7 percent in April, and core PCE price inflation—which excludes changes in energy prices and many consumer food prices—was 2.8 percent. The consumer price index (CPI) in May showed that the 12-month change measure of total CPI inflation was 3.3 percent and core CPI in- flation was 3.4 percent, and recent monthly CPI readings were lower than earlier this year. Although some survey- based measures of short-term inflation expectations had moved up, longer-term expectations were little changed and stood at levels consistent with those that prevailed just before the pandemic. Labor demand and supply continued to move into better balance. Total nonfarm payroll employment increased at only a somewhat slower average monthly pace over April and May than the strong rate recorded in the first quarter. The recently released fourth-quarter data from the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages sug- gested that while the strong reported rate of payroll in- creases last year may have been overstated, job gains were still solid. In May, the unemployment rate ticked up further to 4.0 percent, while the labor force partici- pation rate and the employment-to-population ratio both moved down a little. The unemployment rates for African Americans and for Hispanics were somewhat higher in May than in the first quarter; both rates were above those for Asians and for Whites. The ratio of job vacancies to unemployment declined further to 1.2 in May, about the same as its pre-pandemic level. Most measures of the increase in nominal wages from a year earlier continued to trend down, including the 12-month change in average hourly earnings for all employees, which was 4.1 percent in May, 0.2 percentage point lower than at the end of last year. Real gross domestic product (GDP) rose modestly in the first quarter, held down by significant negative contribu- tions from inventory investment and net exports, which tend to be volatile components. In contrast, private do- mestic final purchases (PDFP)—which comprises PCE and private fixed investment and which often provides a better signal than GDP of underlying economic momen- tum—increased at a solid pace, similar to last year. Re- cent spending indicators suggested that GDP and PDFP were increasing at solid rates in the second quarter. Real exports of goods edged up in April relative to March, following tepid growth in the first quarter. Real imports of goods jumped in April, driven by higher im- ports of autos and capital goods. Overall, the nominal U.S. international trade deficit widened in April, as im- ports of goods and services rose more than exports. Foreign GDP growth firmed in the first quarter. A buoyant service sector helped Europe recover from a modest contraction in the second half of last year. In emerging market economies (EMEs), including China, growth was supported by strong external demand. The first-quarter surge in economic activity in China was also boosted by policy support, especially from fiscal policy. More recent Chinese data, however, especially a steep drop in lending to households and businesses in April, pointed to a considerable slowdown in China’s eco- nomic activity in this quarter. Headline inflation continued to ease in the advanced for- eign economies (AFEs) through May, albeit at a slower pace than last year. While core inflation had slowed sig- nificantly, the core nonhousing services component re- mained elevated in several regions, partly reflecting strong nominal wage growth. Inflation inched up in EMEs, in part because of weather-related increases in food prices in some countries. The Riksbank, the BOC, and the ECB cut their policy rates as market participants expected, amid easing inflation. Communications about future policy decisions varied and were focused on do- mestic economic conditions. Staff Review of the Financial Situation Over the intermeeting period, the market-implied path for the federal funds rate beyond the next few months edged down. Options on interest rate futures suggested that market participants were placing higher odds on policy easing by early 2025 than they did just before the April FOMC meeting. Consistent with the slight down- ward shift in the implied policy path, nominal Treasury yields at all maturities also moved down moderately, driven primarily by declines in real Treasury yields. In- flation compensation also fell some, with larger declines at nearer horizons. Market-based measures of interest rate uncertainty ticked down but remained elevated by historical standards. Broad stock price indexes increased substantially, on net, amid a positive investor outlook on corporate profits and economic activity. Yield spreads on investment- and speculative-grade corporate bonds were little changed, remaining at about the lowest decile of their respective historical distributions. The one-month op- tion-implied volatility on the S&P 500 index remained low by historical standards, suggesting that investors Page 4 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ perceived only modest near-term risks to the economic outlook. Changes in AFE yields were mixed, as spillovers from declines in U.S. yields were partly offset by upside sur- prises in economic data releases in Europe and by some- what more restrictive-than-expected communications by the ECB. The dollar depreciated against most AFE cur- rencies as differentials between U.S. and AFE yields nar- rowed. Nonetheless, the broad dollar index slightly in- creased as the dollar appreciated sharply against the Mexican peso amid heightened policy uncertainty fol- lowing Mexico’s presidential election results. On bal- ance, moves in foreign risky asset prices were mixed and modest, and EME funds saw small inflows. Conditions in U.S. short-term funding markets remained stable over the intermeeting period. Average usage of the ON RRP facility was little changed, primarily reflect- ing the portfolio decisions of money market funds amid lower net Treasury bill supply. Banks’ total deposit lev- els were roughly unchanged over the intermeeting pe- riod, as outflows of core deposits were about offset by inflows of large time deposits. In domestic credit markets, borrowing costs remained elevated despite declining modestly over the intermeet- ing period. Rates on 30-year conforming residential mortgages edged down, on net, over the intermeeting period but remained near recent high levels. Interest rates on new credit card offers were little changed in April at high levels, as were rates on new auto loans. In- terest rates on commercial and industrial (C&I) loans and small business loans also remained elevated. Yields on an array of fixed-income securities, including com- mercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS), invest- ment- and speculative-grade corporate bonds, and resi- dential mortgage-backed securities, moved lower to still- elevated levels relative to recent history. Financing was readily accessible for public corporations and large and middle-market private corporations through capital markets and nonbank lenders. Credit availability for leveraged loan borrowers remained solid over the intermeeting period, while in private credit mar- kets, loan issuance through direct lending was strong. Bank C&I loan balances picked up in April and May. For small firms, the volume of loan originations ticked down in April, and credit availability remained tight. Credit remained largely available to commercial real es- tate (CRE) borrowers outside of construction and land development loans. CRE loans at banks continued to increase in April and May, driven by growth in multifam- ily and nonfarm nonresidential loans. Agency and non- agency CMBS issuance rose in April and May, as falling yields extended the recent wave of refinancing. Consumer credit remained generally available over the intermeeting period despite some signs of tightening. In the residential mortgage market, access to credit was lit- tle changed and continued to depend on borrowers’ credit risk attributes. Although credit card limits contin- ued to rise through March, credit card balances at banks leveled off in April and May. Auto lending at finance companies continued to grow at a moderate pace through April, more than offsetting the decline in auto loan balances at banks and credit unions on net. Credit quality continued to be solid for large and midsize firms, home mortgage borrowers, and municipalities but deteriorated further for other sectors in recent months. While delinquency rates on residential mortgages re- mained near pre-pandemic lows, credit card and auto loan delinquency rates continued to rise in the first quar- ter, signaling a further deterioration of balance sheets of some households. The credit quality of nonfinancial firms borrowing in the corporate bond and leveraged loan markets remained stable overall. Available indica- tors suggested that delinquency rates for the private credit market and for bank C&I loans remained compa- rable to the levels just before the pandemic despite tick- ing up further in the first quarter. For small business loans, delinquency rates stayed slightly above pre- pandemic levels. In the CRE market, credit quality de- teriorated further, as the average CMBS delinquency rate rose in April and May to the highest levels since 2021, driven by the office, hotel, and retail sectors, and the credit quality of CRE borrowers at banks weakened slightly further in the first quarter. Staff Economic Outlook The economic forecast prepared by the staff for the June meeting was similar to the projection at the time of the previous meeting. The economy was expected to main- tain a high rate of resource utilization over the next few years, with real GDP growth projected to be roughly similar to the staff’s estimate of potential output growth. The unemployment rate was expected to edge down slightly over the remainder of this year and the next and then to remain roughly flat in 2026. Total and core PCE price inflation were both projected to be lower at the end of this year than they were at the end of last year. The staff’s inflation projections for this year—which included a preliminary reaction to the May CPI data—were little changed, on balance, from the in- flation forecast at the time of the previous meeting. The inflation forecast was higher, however, than at the time of the March meeting and the March Summary of _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Minutes of the Meeting of June 11–12, 2024 Page 5 Economic Projections (SEP) submissions. Inflation was still expected to decline further in 2025 and 2026, as de- mand and supply in product and labor markets contin- ued to move into better balance; by 2026, total and core PCE price inflation were expected to be close to 2 per- cent. The staff continued to view the uncertainty around the baseline projection as close to the average over the past 20 years. Risks to the inflation forecast were seen as tilted to the upside, reflecting the possibility that more persistent inflation dynamics or supply-side disruptions could unexpectedly materialize. The risks around the forecast for economic activity were seen as skewed to the downside on the grounds that more-persistent infla- tion could result in tighter financial conditions than in the staff’s baseline projection; in addition, deteriorating household financial positions, especially for lower- income households, might prove to have a larger nega- tive effect on economic activity than the staff antici- pated. Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, participants submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and infla- tion for each year from 2024 through 2026 and over the longer run. These projections were based on their indi- vidual assessments of appropriate monetary policy, in- cluding their projections of the federal funds rate. The longer-run projections represented each participant’s as- sessment of the rate to which each variable would tend to converge under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy. The SEP was released to the public after the meeting. In their discussion of inflation developments, partici- pants noted that after a significant decline in inflation during the second half of 2023, the early part of this year had seen a lack of further progress toward the Commit- tee’s 2 percent objective. Participants judged that al- though inflation remained elevated, there had been mod- est further progress toward the 2 percent goal in recent months. Participants observed that some of this pro- gress was evident in the smaller monthly change in the core PCE price index and a lower trimmed mean infla- tion rate for April, with the May CPI reading providing additional evidence. Recent data had also indicated im- provements across a range of price categories, including market-based services. Some participants commented that sustained achievement of the 2 percent inflation ob- jective would be aided by lower overall services price in- flation, and some noted that shelter price inflation had so far been slow to come down. A few participants also highlighted the strong increases recorded this year in core import prices. Nevertheless, participants suggested that a number of developments in the product and labor markets supported their judgment that price pressures were diminishing. In particular, a few participants em- phasized that nominal wage growth, though still above rates consistent with price stability, had declined, notably in labor-intensive sectors. A few participants also noted reports that various retailers had cut prices and offered discounts. Participants further indicated that business contacts reported that their pricing power had declined. Participants suggested that evidence of firms’ reduced pricing power reflected increased customer resistance to price increases, slower growth in economic activity, and a reassessment by businesses of prospective economic conditions. With regard to the outlook for inflation, participants em- phasized that they were strongly committed to their 2 percent objective and that they remained concerned that elevated inflation continued to harm the purchasing power of households, especially those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation. Participants highlighted a variety of fac- tors that were likely to help contribute to continued dis- inflation in the period ahead. The factors included con- tinued easing of demand–supply pressures in product and labor markets, lagged effects on wages and prices of past monetary policy tightening, the delayed response of measured shelter prices to rental market developments, or the prospect of additional supply-side improvements. The latter prospect included the possibility of a boost to productivity associated with businesses’ deployment of artificial intelligence–related technology. Participants observed that longer-term inflation expectations had re- mained well anchored and viewed this anchoring as un- derpinning the disinflation process. Participants af- firmed that additional favorable data were required to give them greater confidence that inflation was moving sustainably toward 2 percent. Participants remarked that demand and supply in the la- bor market had continued to come into better balance. Participants observed that many labor market indicators pointed to a reduced degree of tightness in labor market conditions. These included a declining job openings rate, a lower quits rate, increases in part-time employ- ment for economic reasons, a lower hiring rate, a further step-down in the ratio of job vacancies to unemployed workers, and a gradual uptick in the unemployment rate. In addition, a few participants indicated that business contacts were reporting less difficulty in hiring and re- taining workers, although contacts in several Districts continued to report tight labor market conditions in Page 6 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ certain sectors, such as health care, construction, or spe- cialty manufacturing. Many participants noted that labor supply had been boosted by increased labor force partic- ipation rates as well as by immigration. A few partici- pants noted that it was unlikely that immigration would continue at the pace seen in recent years. However, sev- eral participants judged that, with recent immigrants gradually becoming part of the workforce, past immigra- tion likely would continue to add to labor supply. A few participants observed that increases in labor force par- ticipation would likely now be limited and so would not be a major source of additional labor supply. In consid- ering recent payrolls data, some participants observed that, although increases in payrolls had continued to be strong, the monthly increase in employment consistent with labor market equilibrium might now be higher than in the past because of immigration. Several participants also suggested that the establishment survey may have overstated actual job gains. Several participants re- marked that a variety of indicators, including wage gains for job switchers, suggested that nominal wage growth was slowing, consistent with easing labor market pres- sures. A number of participants noted that, although the labor market remained strong, the ratio of vacancies to unemployment had returned to pre-pandemic levels and there was some risk that further cooling in labor market conditions could be associated with an increased pace of layoffs. Some participants observed that, with the risks to the Committee’s dual-mandate goals having now come into better balance, labor market conditions would need careful monitoring. Participants generally ob- served that continued labor market strength could be consistent with the Committee achieving both its em- ployment and inflation goals, though they noted that some further gradual cooling in the labor market may be required. Participants noted that recent indicators suggested that economic activity had continued to expand at a solid pace. Participants expected that real GDP growth this year would be below the strong pace recorded in 2023, and they remarked that recent data on economic activity were largely consistent with the anticipated slowing. Participants observed that a lower rate of output growth this year could aid the disinflation process while also be- ing consistent with a strong labor market. Participants generally viewed the Committee’s restrictive monetary policy stance as having a restraining effect on growth in consumption and investment spending and as contrib- uting to a gradual slowing in the pace of economic activ- ity. A couple of participants particularly stressed that the Committee’s past policy tightening had contributed to higher rates for home mortgage loans and other longer- term borrowing, which were moderating spending and production, including households’ discretionary pur- chases and residential construction activity. A few par- ticipants remarked that spending by some higher-in- come households was likely being bolstered by increas- ing asset prices. Many participants observed that, in contrast, lower- and moderate-income households were encountering increasing strains as they attempted to meet higher living costs after having largely run down savings accumulated during the pandemic. These partic- ipants noted that such strains, which were evident in ris- ing credit card utilization and delinquency rates as well as motor vehicle loan delinquencies, were a significant concern. Participants continued to assess that the risks to achiev- ing their employment and inflation goals had moved to- ward better balance over the past year. Participants cited a number of downside risks to economic activity, includ- ing those associated with a sharper-than-anticipated slowing in aggregate demand alongside a marked deteri- oration in labor market conditions, or with strains on lower- and moderate-income households’ budgets lead- ing to an abrupt curtailment of consumer spending. A few participants pointed to downside risks to economic activity associated with the fragility of some parts of the CRE sector or the vulnerable balance sheet positions of some banks. Some participants highlighted reasons why inflation could remain above 2 percent for longer than expected. These participants pointed to risks that infla- tion could stay elevated as a result of worsening geopo- litical developments, heightened trade tensions, more persistent shelter price inflation, financial conditions that might be or could become insufficiently restrictive, or U.S. fiscal policy becoming more expansionary than expected; the latter two scenarios were also seen as im- plying upside risks to economic activity. Several partici- pants also cited the risk of an unanchoring of longer- term inflation expectations. In their consideration of monetary policy at this meeting, participants observed that incoming data indicated con- tinued solid growth in economic activity and a strong la- bor market while also pointing to modest further pro- gress toward the Committee’s 2 percent inflation objec- tive in recent months. Participants remained highly at- tentive to inflation risks. All participants judged that, in light of current economic conditions and their implica- tions for the outlook for employment and inflation, as well as the balance of risks, it was appropriate to main- tain the target range for the federal funds rate at 5¼ to 5½ percent. Participants furthermore judged that it was appropriate to continue the process of reducing the Fed- eral Reserve’s securities holdings. _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Minutes of the Meeting of June 11–12, 2024 Page 7 In discussing the outlook for monetary policy, partici- pants noted that progress in reducing inflation had been slower this year than they had expected last December. They emphasized that they did not expect that it would be appropriate to lower the target range for the federal funds rate until additional information had emerged to give them greater confidence that inflation was moving sustainably toward the Committee’s 2 percent objective. In discussing their individual outlooks for the target range for the federal funds rate, participants emphasized the importance of conditioning future policy decisions on incoming data, the evolving economic outlook, and the balance of risks. Several participants noted that fi- nancial market reactions to data and feedback received from contacts suggested that the Committee’s policy ap- proach was generally well understood. Some partici- pants suggested that further clarity about the FOMC’s reaction function might be provided by communications that emphasized the Committee’s data-dependent ap- proach, with monetary policy decisions being condi- tional on the evolution of the economy rather than being on a preset path. A couple of participants remarked that providing more information about the Committee’s views on the economic outlook and the risks around the outlook would improve the public’s understanding of the Committee’s decisions. In discussing risk-management considerations that could bear on the outlook for monetary policy, partici- pants assessed that, with labor market tightness having eased and inflation having declined over the past year, the risks to achieving the Committee’s employment and inflation goals had moved toward better balance, leaving monetary policy well positioned to deal with the risks and uncertainties faced in pursuing both sides of the Committee’s dual mandate. The vast majority of partic- ipants assessed that growth in economic activity ap- peared to be gradually cooling, and most participants re- marked that they viewed the current policy stance as re- strictive. Some participants noted that there was uncer- tainty about the degree of restrictiveness of current pol- icy. Some remarked that the continued strength of the economy, as well as other factors, could mean that the longer-run equilibrium interest rate was higher than pre- viously assessed, in which case both the stance of mon- etary policy and overall financial conditions may be less restrictive than they might appear. A couple of partici- pants noted that the longer-run equilibrium interest rate was a better guide for determining where the federal funds rate may need to move over the longer run than for assessing the restrictiveness of current policy. Par- ticipants noted the uncertainty associated with the eco- nomic outlook and with how long it would be appropri- ate to maintain a restrictive policy stance. Some participants emphasized the need for patience in allow- ing the Committee’s restrictive policy stance to restrain aggregate demand and further moderate inflation pres- sures. Several participants observed that, were inflation to persist at an elevated level or to increase further, the target range for the federal funds rate might need to be raised. A number of participants remarked that mone- tary policy should stand ready to respond to unexpected economic weakness. Several participants specifically emphasized that with the labor market normalizing, a further weakening of demand may now generate a larger unemployment response than in the recent past when lower demand for labor was felt relatively more through fewer job openings. Committee Policy Actions In their discussions of monetary policy for this meeting, members agreed that economic activity continued to ex- pand at a solid pace. Job gains remained strong, and the unemployment rate remained low. Inflation eased over the past year but remained elevated. Members con- curred that, in recent months, there was modest further progress toward the Committee’s 2 percent inflation ob- jective and agreed to acknowledge this development in the postmeeting statement. Members judged that the risks to achieving the Committee’s employment and in- flation goals had moved toward better balance over the past year. Members viewed the economic outlook as un- certain and agreed that they remained highly attentive to inflation risks. In support of the Committee’s goals to achieve maxi- mum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run, members agreed to maintain the tar- get range for the federal funds rate at 5¼ to 5½ percent. Members concurred that, in considering any adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, they would carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. Members agreed that they did not expect that it would be appropriate to reduce the target range until they have gained greater confidence that in- flation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent. In addi- tion, members agreed to continue to reduce the Federal Reserve’s holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities. All mem- bers affirmed their strong commitment to returning in- flation to the Committee’s 2 percent objective. Members agreed that, in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, they would continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. They would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerged that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals. Members also agreed that their assessments would take Page 8 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ into account a wide range of information, including readings on labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and interna- tional developments. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the following domestic policy directive, for release at 2:00 p.m.: “Effective June 13, 2024, the Federal Open Market Committee directs the Desk to:  Undertake open market operations as nec- essary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of 5¼ to 5½ percent.  Conduct standing overnight repurchase agreement operations with a minimum bid rate of 5.5 percent and with an aggregate operation limit of $500 billion.  Conduct standing overnight reverse repur- chase agreement operations at an offering rate of 5.3 percent and with a per-counter- party limit of $160 billion per day.  Roll over at auction the amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s hold- ings of Treasury securities maturing in each calendar month that exceeds a cap of $25 billion per month. Redeem Treasury coupon securities up to this monthly cap and Treasury bills to the extent that coupon principal payments are less than the monthly cap.  Reinvest the amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) received in each calendar month that exceeds a cap of $35 billion per month into Treasury securities to roughly match the maturity composition of Treas- ury securities outstanding.  Allow modest deviations from stated amounts for reinvestments, if needed for operational reasons.  Engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settle- ment of the Federal Reserve’s agency MBS transactions.” The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below for release at 2:00 p.m.: “Recent indicators suggest that economic activ- ity has continued to expand at a solid pace. Job gains have remained strong, and the unemploy- ment rate has remained low. Inflation has eased over the past year but remains elevated. In re- cent months, there has been modest further progress toward the Committee’s 2 percent in- flation objective. The Committee seeks to achieve maximum em- ployment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. The Committee judges that the risks to achieving its employment and infla- tion goals have moved toward better balance over the past year. The economic outlook is un- certain, and the Committee remains highly at- tentive to inflation risks. In support of its goals, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 5¼ to 5½ percent. In considering any adjustments to the target range for the fed- eral funds rate, the Committee will carefully as- sess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. The Committee does not expect it will be appropriate to reduce the target range until it has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 per- cent. In addition, the Committee will continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage‑backed secu- rities. The Committee is strongly committed to returning inflation to its 2 percent objective. In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals. The Committee’s assessments will take into account a wide range of information, in- cluding readings on labor market conditions, in- flation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.” Voting for this action: Jerome H. Powell, John C. Williams, Thomas I. Barkin, Michael S. Barr, Raphael W. Bostic, Michelle W. Bowman, Lisa D. Cook, Mary C. Daly, Philip N. Jefferson, Adriana D. Kugler, Loretta J. Mester, and Christopher J. Waller. Voting against this action: None. _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Minutes of the Meeting of June 11–12, 2024 Page 9 Consistent with the Committee’s decision to leave the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted unanimously to maintain the interest rate paid on reserve balances at 5.4 percent, effective June 13, 2024.

Financial conditions eased modestly over the intermeeting period, reflecting lower long-term interest rates and higher equity prices. The manager noted that current financial conditions appeared to be providing neither a headwind nor tailwind to growth. Nominal Treasury yields declined over the period, with shorter-term yields having decreased by more than longer-term yields, leading to a steepening of the yield curve. Treasury yields remained sensitive to surprises in economic data, particularly consumer price index releases and employment reports. While near-term inflation compensation fell over the intermeeting period, longer-term forward measures were little changed. Measures of inflation expectations obtained from term structure models were modestly lower. The policy rate path derived from futures prices and the modal path derived from options prices both declined over the intermeeting period and had come into closer alignment with the median of the modal responses from the Open Market Desk’s Survey of Primary Dealers and Survey of Market Participants. Policy expectations, however measured, pointed to a first rate cut at the September FOMC meeting, at least one more cut later in the year, and further policy easing next year. In the equity markets, the high perceived likelihood of a September cut in the target range for the policy rate induced a notable appreciation in the stocks of firms with small and medium capitalization, which tend to be more sensitive to interest rates. Stocks of larger companies, especially those in the technology sector, underperformed. Second-quarter earnings reports received before the meeting had been slightly above analysts’ expectations, although some companies noted a softening in consumer spending. 1 The Federal Open Market Committee is referenced as the “FOMC” and the “Committee” in these minutes; the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System is referenced as the “Board” in these minutes. 2 July 30–31, 2024 Expectations for policy rates in most advanced foreign economies (AFEs) declined, as recent data generally pointed to continued progress on inflation. Although most AFE central banks had cut their policy rates or were expected to do so soon, the manager noted that market participants continued to expect the Bank of Japan to tighten policy this year. The sudden announcement of a French election contributed to some short-term market volatility early in the intermeeting period, including a widening between yields of French and German 10-year sovereign bonds and a widening in spreads for off-the- run U.S. Treasury securities, but the effects on U.S. Treasury markets were short lived. The effective federal funds rate remained unchanged over the intermeeting period, but the manager noted that rates on repurchase agreements (repo) had edged higher, reflecting increased demand for financing Treasury securities as well as the expected effects of gradual balance sheet normalization. Use of the overnight reverse repo (ON RRP) facility declined slightly over the intermeeting period. The staff projected that ON RRP usage would decline more noticeably over the remainder of the year, particularly as issuance of Treasury bills increases. However, the manager noted that it was possible that idiosyncratic factors specific to some ON RRP participants might support ON RRP balances in the months ahead. Looking at a range of money market indicators, the manager concluded that reserves remained abundant but indicated that the staff would continue to closely monitor developments in money markets. Finally, the manager described a set of technical adjustments to the production of the Secured Overnight Financing Rate that the Federal Reserve Bank of New York had proposed in a recent public consultation. By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk’s domestic transactions over the intermeeting period. There were no intervention operations in foreign currencies for the System’s account during the intermeeting period. Staff Review of the Economic Situation The information available at the time of the meeting indicated that U.S. economic activity had advanced solidly so far this year, but at a markedly slower pace than in the second half of 2023. Labor market conditions continued to ease: Job gains moderated, and the unemployment rate moved up further but remained low. Consumer price inflation was well below its year-earlier pace but remained somewhat elevated. Consumer price inflation—as measured by the 12-month change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE)—was about the same in June as it was at the start of the year, though the month-over-month changes in May and June were smaller than those seen earlier in the year. Total PCE price inflation was 2.5 percent in June, and core PCE price inflation—which excludes changes in energy prices and many consumer food prices—was 2.6 percent. Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee 3 Recent data suggested that labor market conditions had eased further. Average monthly nonfarm payroll gains in the second quarter were smaller than the average pace seen in the first quarter and over the previous year. The unemployment rate moved up further in June to 4.1 percent; the labor force participation rate ticked up as well, and the employment-to-population ratio was unchanged. The unemployment rate for African Americans rose in June, while the rate for Hispanics declined slightly; both rates were above that for Whites. The ratio of job vacancies to unemployment remained at 1.2 in June, about the same as its pre-pandemic level. Measures of nominal wages continued to decelerate: Average hourly earnings for all employees rose 3.9 percent over the 12 months ending in June, down 0.8 percentage point relative to a year earlier, and the 12-month change in the employment cost index of hourly compensation of private industry workers was 3.9 percent in June, down 0.6 percentage point from its year-earlier pace. According to the advance release, real gross domestic product (GDP) rose solidly in the second quarter after a modest gain in the first quarter. Over the first half of the year, GDP growth was noticeably slower than its average pace in 2023. However, real private domestic final purchases (PDFP)—which comprises PCE and private fixed investment and which often provides a better signal than GDP of underlying economic momentum—posted a solid second-quarter increase that was in line with its first- quarter pace and only moderately slower than its average rate of increase in 2023. As in the first quarter, net exports subtracted from U.S. GDP growth in the second quarter. Growth in real exports of goods and services remained tepid overall, as gains in exports of capital goods and consumer goods were partly offset by declines in exports of foods and industrial supplies. By contrast, real imports continued to rise at a brisk pace, driven by further increases in imports of capital goods. Foreign economic growth was estimated to have been subdued in the second quarter, held down by a sharp deceleration in economic activity in China amid ongoing property-sector woes. In Europe and Latin America, output likely expanded below its trend pace, as restrictive monetary policy continued to be a drag on activity. Recent global inflation developments were mixed. In the AFEs, headline inflation edged down in the second quarter but generally remained above target levels. In emerging market economies, headline inflation rose a touch overall, reflecting, in part, run-ups in food prices in some countries. The Bank of Canada and the Swiss National Bank cut their policy rates further, in part citing easing inflation pressures. The People’s Bank of China also lowered some key policy rates amid ongoing property- sector woes and weak consumer sentiment. 4 July 30–31, 2024 Staff Review of the Financial Situation The market-implied path for the federal funds rate moved down over the intermeeting period. Options on interest rate futures suggested that market participants were placing higher odds on a larger policy easing by early 2025 than they did just before the June meeting. Consistent with the downward shift in the implied policy path, nominal Treasury yields moved down, on net, with the most pronounced declines at shorter horizons driven largely by decreases in inflation compensation. Broad stock price indexes rose slightly on net. Yield spreads on investment- and speculative-grade corporate bonds were little changed and remained at about the lowest decile of their respective historical distributions. The one-month option-implied volatility on the S&P 500 index rose moderately and was somewhat elevated by historical standards, suggesting that investors perceived some, but not outsized, risks to the economic outlook. Market-based measures of the expected paths of policy rates and sovereign bond yields in most AFEs fell notably, largely in response to declines in U.S. rates. Following the surprise announcement of parliamentary elections in France, the spread between yields of French and German 10-year sovereign bonds widened to its highest level since 2012 but then partially retraced on the outcome of no clear parliamentary majority. The broad dollar index was little changed over the intermeeting period. On balance, moves in foreign risky asset prices were mixed and modest. Overnight secured rates edged up over the intermeeting period, but conditions in U.S. short-term funding markets remained stable, with typical dynamics observed surrounding quarter-end. Average usage of the ON RRP facility declined slightly. Banks’ total deposit levels increased modestly, as large time deposits displayed moderate inflows. In domestic credit markets, borrowing costs remained elevated over the intermeeting period despite modest declines in some markets. Rates on 30-year conforming residential mortgages declined, on net, over the intermeeting period but stayed near recent high levels. Interest rates on new credit card offers increased slightly, while rates on new auto loans were little changed. Interest rates on small business loans remained elevated. Yields on an array of fixed-income securities—including commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS), investment- and speculative-grade corporate bonds, and residential mortgage-backed securities—moved lower to still-elevated levels relative to recent history. The declines were largely driven by decreases in Treasury yields. Financing through capital markets and nonbank lenders was readily accessible for public corporations and large and middle-market private corporations, and credit availability for leveraged loan borrowers remained solid over the intermeeting period. For smaller firms, however, credit availability remained moderately tight. In the July Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices (SLOOS), Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee 5 banks reported modestly tighter standards and lending terms for commercial and industrial (C&I) loans, on net, while reported demand for C&I loans remained about unchanged. Meanwhile, C&I loan balances increased in the second quarter. Regarding commercial real estate (CRE) loans, banks in the July SLOOS reported tightening standards for all loan categories. Nonetheless, bank CRE loan balances increased over the second quarter, albeit at a diminished pace relative to the previous quarter. Credit remained available for most consumers over the intermeeting period, though credit growth showed signs of moderating. Credit card balances slowed in June, and SLOOS respondents indicated that standards for credit cards tightened moderately in the second quarter. Although banks reported in the SLOOS that lending standards on auto loans were unchanged in the second quarter, growth in auto lending at both banks and nonbanks contracted further. In the residential mortgage market, access to credit was little changed overall and continued to depend on borrowers’ credit risk attributes. Credit quality remained solid for large and midsize firms, home mortgage borrowers, and municipalities but continued to deteriorate in other sectors. The credit quality of nonfinancial firms borrowing in the corporate bond and leveraged loan markets remained stable. Delinquency rates on loans to small businesses remained slightly above pre-pandemic levels. Credit quality in the CRE market deteriorated further, with the average delinquency rate for loans in CMBS and the share of nonperforming CRE loans at banks both rising further. Regarding household balance sheets, delinquency rates on most residential mortgages remained near pre-pandemic lows. Though consumer delinquency rates had increased, particularly among nonprime borrowers, the rise in delinquency rates for both credit cards and auto loans slowed in the second quarter. The staff provided an update on its assessment of the stability of the U.S. financial system and, on balance, continued to characterize the system’s financial vulnerabilities as notable. The staff judged that asset valuation pressures remained elevated, with estimates of risk premiums across key markets low compared with historical standards. House prices remained elevated relative to fundamentals. CRE prices continued to decline, especially in the multifamily and office sectors, and vacancy rates in these sectors continued to increase. Vulnerabilities associated with business and household debt were characterized as moderate. Nonfinancial business leverage was high, but the ability of public firms to service their debt remained solid, in large part due to strong earnings. The fraction of private firms with low debt-servicing ability continued to move up and remained at high levels compared with the past decade. Household balance sheets remained strong overall, as aggregate home equity stayed quite high and delinquencies on mortgage loans remained low. 6 July 30–31, 2024 Leverage in the financial sector was characterized as notable. Regulatory capital ratios in the banking sector remained high. The fair value of bank assets, however, remained low. For the nonbank sector, leverage at hedge funds was at its highest recorded level based on data since 2013, partly due to the prevalence of the cash–futures basis trade. Leverage at life insurers was somewhat elevated, and their holdings of risky and illiquid securities continued to grow. Funding risks were also characterized as notable. Assets in prime money market funds and other runnable cash-management vehicles remained near historical highs. Life insurers’ greater reliance on nontraditional liabilities, coupled with their increasing holdings of risky corporate debt, suggested that adverse shocks to the industry could trigger substantial funding pressures at these firms. Staff Economic Outlook The economic forecast prepared by the staff for the July meeting implied a lower rate of resource utilization over the projection period relative to the forecast prepared for the previous meeting. The staff’s outlook for growth in the second half of 2024 had been marked down largely in response to weaker-than-expected labor market indicators. As a result, the output gap at the start of 2025 was somewhat narrower than had been previously projected, although still not fully closed. Over 2025 and 2026, real GDP growth was expected to rise about in line with potential, leaving the output gap roughly flat in those years. The unemployment rate was expected to edge up slightly over the remainder of 2024 and then to remain roughly unchanged in 2025 and 2026. The staff’s inflation forecast was slightly lower than the one prepared for the previous meeting, reflecting incoming data and the lower projected level of resource utilization. Both total and core PCE price inflation were expected to decline further as demand and supply in product and labor markets continued to move into better balance; by 2026, total and core inflation were expected to be around 2 percent. The staff continued to view the uncertainty around the baseline projection as close to the average over the past 20 years. Risks to the inflation forecast were still seen as tilted to the upside, albeit to a smaller degree than at the time of the previous meeting. The risks around the forecast for real activity were viewed as skewed to the downside, both because more-persistent inflation could result in tighter financial conditions than in the baseline and because the recent softening in some indicators of labor market conditions might be pointing to a larger-than-anticipated slowdown in aggregate demand growth. Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee 7 Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook Participants observed that inflation had eased over the past year but remained elevated and that, in recent months, there had been some further progress toward the Committee’s 2 percent inflation objective. Participants noted that the recent progress on disinflation was broad based across the major subcomponents of core inflation. Core goods prices were about flat from March through June after having risen during the first three months of the year. Price inflation in June for housing services showed a notable slowing, which participants had been anticipating for some time. In addition, core nonhousing services prices had decelerated in recent months. Some participants noted that the recent data corroborated reports from their business contacts that firms’ pricing power was waning, as consumers appeared to be more sensitive to price increases. Various contacts had also reported that they had cut prices or were offering discounts to stay competitive, or that declines in input costs had helped reduce pressure on retail prices. With regard to the outlook for inflation, participants judged that recent data had increased their confidence that inflation was moving sustainably toward 2 percent. Almost all participants observed that the factors that had contributed to recent disinflation would likely continue to put downward pressure on inflation in coming months. These factors included a continued waning of pricing power, moderating economic growth, and the runoff in excess household savings accumulated during the pandemic. Many participants noted that the moderation of growth in labor costs as labor market conditions rebalanced would continue to contribute to disinflation, particularly in core nonhousing services prices. Some participants noted that the lags in the time it takes for housing rental conditions for new tenants to show through to aggregate price data for housing services meant that the disinflationary trend in this component would likely continue. Participants also observed that longer-term inflation expectations had remained well anchored and viewed this anchoring as underpinning the disinflation process. A couple of participants noted that inflation pressures might persist for some time, as they assessed that the economy had considerable momentum, and that, even with some easing of the demand for labor, the labor market remained strong. Participants assessed that supply and demand conditions in the labor market had continued to come into better balance. The unemployment rate had moved up but remained low, having risen 0.7 percentage point since its trough in April 2023 to 4.1 percent in June. The monthly pace of payroll job gains had moderated from the first quarter but had been solid in recent months. However, many participants noted that reported payroll gains might be overstated, and several assessed that payroll gains may be lower than those needed to keep the unemployment rate constant with a flat labor force participation rate. Participants observed that other indicators also pointed to easing in labor market conditions, including a lower hiring rate and a downtrend in job vacancies since the beginning of the 8 July 30–31, 2024 year. Participants noted that the rebalancing of labor market conditions over the past year was also aided by an expansion of the supply of workers, reflecting increases in the labor force participation rate among individuals aged 25 to 54 and a strong pace of immigration. Participants noted that, with continued rebalancing of labor market conditions, nominal wage growth had continued to moderate. Many participants cited reports from District contacts that supported the view that labor market conditions had been easing. In particular, contacts reported that they had been experiencing less difficulty in hiring and retaining workers and that they saw limited wage pressures. Participants generally assessed that, overall, conditions in the labor market had returned to about where they stood on the eve of the pandemic—strong but not overheated. Regarding the outlook for the labor market, participants discussed various indicators of layoffs, including initial claims for unemployment benefits and measures of job separations. Some participants commented that these indicators had remained at levels consistent with a strong labor market. Participants agreed that these and other indicators of labor market conditions merited close monitoring. Several participants said that their District contacts reported that they were actively managing head counts through selective hiring and attrition. Participants noted that real GDP growth was solid in the first half of the year, though slower than the robust pace seen in the second half of last year. PDFP growth, which usually gives a better signal than GDP growth of economic momentum, also moderated in the first half, but by less than GDP growth. PDFP expanded at a solid pace, supported by growth in consumer spending and business fixed investment. Participants viewed the moderation in the growth of economic activity to be largely in line with what they had anticipated. Regarding the household sector, participants observed that consumer spending had slowed from last year’s robust pace, consistent with restrictive monetary policy, easing of labor market conditions, and slowing income growth. They noted, however, that consumer spending had still grown at a solid pace in the first half of the year, supported by the still-strong labor market and aggregate household balance sheets. Some participants observed that lower- and moderate-income households were encountering increasing strains as they attempted to meet higher living costs after having largely run down savings accumulated during the pandemic. These participants noted that such strains were evident in indicators such as rising credit card delinquency rates and an increased share of households paying the minimum due on balances, and warranted continued close monitoring. Several participants cited reports that consumers, especially those in lower-income households, were shifting away from discretionary spending and switching to lower-cost food items and brands. A couple of participants remarked that spending by some higher-income households was likely being bolstered by wealth effects from equity and housing price appreciation. Participants noted that residential Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee 9 investment was weak in the second quarter, likely reflecting the pickup in mortgage rates from earlier in the year. Regarding the business sector, participants noted that conditions varied by firm size, sector, and region. A couple of participants noted that their District contacts had reported larger firms as having a generally stable outlook, while the outlook for smaller firms appeared more uncertain. A few participants said that their contacts reported that conditions in the manufacturing sector were somewhat weaker, while the professional and business services sector and technology-related sectors remained strong. A few participants noted that the agricultural sector continued to face strains stemming from low food commodity prices and high input costs. Participants discussed the risks and uncertainties around the economic outlook. Upside risks to the inflation outlook were seen as having diminished, while downside risks to employment were seen as having increased. Participants saw risks to achieving the inflation and employment objectives as continuing to move into better balance, with a couple noting that they viewed these risks as more or less balanced. Some participants noted that as conditions in the labor market have eased, the risk had increased that continued easing could transition to a more serious deterioration. As sources of upside risks to inflation, some participants cited the potential for disruptions to supply chains and a further deterioration in geopolitical conditions. A few participants noted that an easing of financial conditions could boost economic activity and present an upside risk to economic growth and inflation. In their discussion of financial stability, participants who commented noted vulnerabilities to the financial system that they assessed warranted monitoring. Some participants observed that the banking system was sound but noted risks associated with unrealized losses on securities, reliance on uninsured deposits, and interconnections with nonbank financial intermediaries. In their discussion of bank funding, several participants commented that, because the discount window is an important liquidity backstop, the Federal Reserve should continue to improve the window’s operational efficiency and to communicate effectively about the window’s value. Participants generally noted that some banks and nonbank financial institutions likely have vulnerabilities associated with high CRE exposures through loan portfolios and holdings of CMBS. Most of these participants remarked that risks related to CRE exposures depend importantly on the property type and the local market conditions of the properties involved. A couple of participants noted concerns about asset valuation pressures in other markets as well. Many participants commented on cyber risks that could impair the operation of financial institutions, financial infrastructure, and, potentially, the overall economy. Many participants remarked that because a few firms play a substantial role in the provision of information technology services to the financial sector and because of the highly interconnected nature of some firms in the financial industry itself, there was an increased risk that significant cyber disruptions at a small number of key firms could have widespread effects. Several participants noted that leverage in 10 July 30–31, 2024 the Treasury market remained a risk, that it would be important to monitor developments regarding Treasury market resilience amid the move to central clearing, or that it is valuable to communicate about the Federal Reserve’s standing repo facility as a liquidity backstop. A couple of participants commented on the financial condition of low- and moderate-income households that have exhausted their savings and the importance of monitoring rising delinquency rates on credit cards and auto loans. In their consideration of monetary policy at this meeting, participants observed that recent indicators suggested that economic activity had continued to expand at a solid pace, job gains had moderated, and the unemployment rate had moved up but remained low. While inflation remained somewhat above the Committee’s longer-run goal of 2 percent, participants noted that inflation had eased over the past year and that recent incoming data indicated some further progress toward the Committee’s objective. All participants supported maintaining the target range for the federal funds rate at 5¼ to 5½ percent, although several observed that the recent progress on inflation and increases in the unemployment rate had provided a plausible case for reducing the target range 25 basis points at this meeting or that they could have supported such a decision. Participants furthermore judged that it was appropriate to continue the process of reducing the Federal Reserve’s securities holdings. In discussing the outlook for monetary policy, participants noted that growth in economic activity had been solid, there had been some further progress on inflation, and conditions in the labor market had eased. Almost all participants remarked that while the incoming data regarding inflation were encouraging, additional information was needed to provide greater confidence that inflation was moving sustainably toward the Committee’s 2 percent objective before it would be appropriate to lower the target range for the federal funds rate. Nevertheless, participants viewed the incoming data as enhancing their confidence that inflation was moving toward the Committee’s objective. The vast majority observed that, if the data continued to come in about as expected, it would likely be appropriate to ease policy at the next meeting. Many participants commented that monetary policy continued to be restrictive, although they expressed a range of views about the degree of restrictiveness, and a few participants noted that ongoing disinflation, with no change in the nominal target range for the policy rate, by itself results in a tightening in monetary policy. Most participants remarked on the importance of communicating the Committee’s data-dependent approach and emphasized, in particular, that monetary policy decisions are conditional on the evolution of the economy rather than being on a preset path or that those decisions depend on the totality of the incoming data rather than on any particular data point. Several participants stressed the need to monitor conditions in money markets and factors affecting the demand for reserves amid the ongoing reduction in the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet. Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee 11 In discussing risk-management considerations that could bear on the outlook for monetary policy, participants highlighted uncertainties affecting the outlook, such as those regarding the amount of restraint currently provided by monetary policy, the lags with which past and current restraint have affected and will affect economic activity, and the degree of normalization of the economy following disruptions associated with the pandemic. A majority of participants remarked that the risks to the employment goal had increased, and many participants noted that the risks to the inflation goal had decreased. Some participants noted the risk that a further gradual easing in labor market conditions could transition to a more serious deterioration. Many participants noted that reducing policy restraint too late or too little could risk unduly weakening economic activity or employment. A couple participants highlighted in particular the costs and challenges of addressing such a weakening once it is fully under way. Several participants remarked that reducing policy restraint too soon or too much could risk a resurgence in aggregate demand and a reversal of the progress on inflation. These participants pointed to risks related to potential shocks that could put upward pressure on inflation or the possibility that inflation could prove more persistent than currently expected. Committee Policy Actions In their discussions of monetary policy for this meeting, members agreed that economic activity had continued to expand at a solid pace. Job gains had moderated, and the unemployment rate had moved up but remained low. Inflation eased over the past year but remained somewhat elevated. Members concurred that, in recent months, there had been some further progress toward the Committee’s 2 percent inflation objective. Members judged that the risks to achieving the Committee’s employment and inflation goals had continued to move into better balance. Members viewed the economic outlook as uncertain and agreed that they were attentive to the risks to both sides of the Committee’s dual mandate. In support of the Committee’s goals to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run, members agreed to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 5¼ to 5½ percent. Members concurred that, in considering any adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, they would carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. Members agreed that they did not expect that it would be appropriate to reduce the target range until they had gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent. In addition, members agreed to continue to reduce the Federal Reserve’s holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage‑backed securities. All members affirmed their strong commitment to returning inflation to the Committee’s 2 percent objective. Members agreed that, in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, they would continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. They would be prepared to 12 July 30–31, 2024 adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerged that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals. Members also agreed that their assessments would take into account a wide range of information, including readings on labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments. Members agreed that to appropriately reflect developments since the previous meeting related to their maximum-employment objective, they should note in the statement that “job gains have moderated, and the unemployment rate has moved up but remains low.” Similarly, to appropriately reflect developments related to their price-stability objective, they agreed to note that “there has been some further progress toward the Committee’s 2 percent inflation objective.” Members also agreed to reflect the shifting balance of risks by stating that “the Committee judges that the risks to achieving its employment and inflation goals continue to move into better balance” and that “the Committee is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate.” At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Open Market Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive, for release at 2:00 p.m.: “Effective August 1, 2024, the Federal Open Market Committee directs the Desk to: • Undertake open market operations as necessary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of 5¼ to 5½ percent. • Conduct standing overnight repurchase agreement operations with a minimum bid rate of 5.5 percent and with an aggregate operation limit of $500 billion. • Conduct standing overnight reverse repurchase agreement operations at an offering rate of 5.3 percent and with a per-counterparty limit of $160 billion per day. • Roll over at auction the amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of Treasury securities maturing in each calendar month that exceeds a cap of $25 billion per month. Redeem Treasury coupon securities up to this monthly cap and Treasury bills to the extent that coupon principal payments are less than the monthly cap. • Reinvest the amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) received in each calendar month that exceeds a cap of $35 billion per month into Treasury securities to roughly match the maturity composition of Treasury securities outstanding. • Allow modest deviations from stated amounts for reinvestments, if needed for operational reasons. Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee 13 • Engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal Reserve’s agency MBS transactions.” The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below for release at 2:00 p.m.: “Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace. Job gains have moderated, and the unemployment rate has moved up but remains low. Inflation has eased over the past year but remains somewhat elevated. In recent months, there has been some further progress toward the Committee’s 2 percent inflation objective. The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. The Committee judges that the risks to achieving its employment and inflation goals continue to move into better balance. The economic outlook is uncertain, and the Committee is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate. In support of its goals, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 5¼ to 5½ percent. In considering any adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. The Committee does not expect it will be appropriate to reduce the target range until it has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent. In addition, the Committee will continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage‑backed securities. The Committee is strongly committed to returning inflation to its 2 percent objective. In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals. The Committee’s assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.” Voting for this action: Jerome H.

{"date": "2024-09-18", "year": 2024, "source_type": "FOMC Minutes", "url": "https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20240918.pdf", "text": "1 Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee September 17–18, 2024 A joint meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System was held in the offices of the Board of Governors on Tuesday, September 17, 2024, at 10:30 a.m. and continued on Wednesday, September 18, 2024, at 9:00 a.m.1 Developments in Financial Markets and Open Market Operations The manager turned first to a review of developments in financial markets. Nominal Treasury yields declined notably over the period, driven by weaker-than-expected data releases—especially the July employment report in early August—and policy communications that were seen as affirming expectations that a reduction in policy restraint would begin at this meeting. The decline in nominal yields over the period was primarily attributable to lower expected real yields, but measures of inflation compensation declined as well. Broad equity prices finished the period modestly higher, while credit spreads had come off the very tight levels seen earlier this year but were still narrow by historical standards. Overall, risky asset prices were compatible with continued economic expansion. The manager also discussed the brief episode of elevated market volatility in early August. That episode saw some large moves in U.S. and foreign equity indexes, equity-implied volatilities, the dollar–yen exchange rate, and Treasury yields. These sharp moves appeared to be the result of a rapid unwinding of some speculative trading positions induced by unrelated events—such as the unexpectedly inflation-focused communications from the Bank of Japan (BOJ) in late July and the weaker-than-expected U.S. employment report in early August—and amplified by technical and liquidity factors. All told, the unwinding process was contained, and market functioning recovered relatively quickly. Turning to policy expectations, the manager noted that the market-implied policy rate path shifted down materially. At the time of the September meeting, the modal path for the federal funds rate implied by options prices was consistent with about 100 basis points of cuts through year-end, compared with around 50 basis points at the time of the July meeting. The average path for the federal funds rate obtained from futures prices also shifted notably lower and remained below the options-implied modal path, likely reflecting investors’ perception that risks were tilted toward more 1 The Federal Open Market Committee is referenced as the “FOMC” and the “Committee” in these minutes; the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System is referenced as the “Board” in these minutes. 2 September 17–18, 2024 rather than fewer cuts. In the Open Market Desk’s Survey of Primary Dealers and Survey of Market Participants, most respondents had a modal expectation of a 25 basis point cut at this meeting, though the manager also noted that, since the time of the surveys—about a week earlier—the probability of a 50 basis point cut at the September meeting implied by futures prices had increased and exceeded the implied probability of a 25 basis point cut. The median respondent’s modal path for the federal funds rate shifted down notably over the next two years, in line with the options-implied modal path, and was unchanged thereafter. Balance sheet expectations in the surveys were little changed from July. Most survey respondents did not appear to be concerned about an economic downturn in either the near or medium term; the median dealer’s most likely path of the unemployment rate for the next few years was only modestly higher than that in the July survey and was roughly stable around current levels. In international developments, many central banks in advanced foreign economies (AFEs) had begun or continued to lower policy rates during the intermeeting period, with the Bank of England (BOE) deciding to initiate its rate-cutting cycle with a 25 basis point reduction and the European Central Bank (ECB) and the Bank of Canada (BOC) delivering their second and third 25 basis point cut, respectively. The market-implied expectations for year-end policy rates fell over the period for most central banks in AFEs, although by a smaller amount than they did for the Federal Reserve, contributing to a modest decline in the trade-weighted U.S. dollar index. The manager then turned to money markets and Desk operations. Unsecured overnight rates remained stable over the intermeeting period. In secured funding markets, rates on overnight repurchase agreements (repo) were higher than a few months earlier amid large issuance of Treasury securities and elevated demand for securities financing but were little changed, on net, over the period. The manager discussed the interconnections between the repo and federal funds markets, underscoring the importance of monitoring a range of indicators to assess reserve conditions and the state of money markets. Looking at a range of such indicators, the manager concluded that reserves appeared to remain abundant. Usage of the overnight reverse repurchase agreement (ON RRP) facility declined about $100 billion over the intermeeting period, helped by an increase in the net supply of Treasury bills. With net bill supply expected to decrease as a result of the September tax date before increasing again, the staff assessed that the decline in ON RRP usage might slow over the coming intermeeting period before resuming later this year. The manager also added that, with the concentration of ON RRP usage in a small number of fund complexes, there was an increased risk that idiosyncratic allocation decisions could have an outsized effect on aggregate ON RRP volumes. Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee 3 By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk’s domestic transactions over the intermeeting period. There were no intervention operations in foreign currencies for the System’s account during the intermeeting period. Staff Review of the Economic Situation The information available at the time of the meeting indicated that real gross domestic product (GDP) had expanded solidly so far this year. The pace of job gains continued to moderate since the beginning of the year, and the unemployment rate had moved up but remained low. Consumer price inflation was well below its year-earlier rate but remained somewhat elevated. Consumer price inflation—as measured by the 12-month change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE)—was lower in July than it had been in March, which had followed some high month-over-month changes in the beginning of the year. Monthly changes in PCE prices since April had been smaller than those seen in the first three months of the year. On a 12-month basis, total PCE price inflation was 2.5 percent in July, and core PCE price inflation—which excludes changes in energy prices and many consumer food prices—was 2.6 percent. In August, the 12-month change in the consumer price index (CPI) was 2.5 percent, and core CPI inflation was 3.2 percent; both measures were well below their rates from a year ago. The staff estimated, given both the CPI and producer price index data, that total PCE price inflation would be 2.2 percent over the 12 months ending in August and that core PCE price inflation would be 2.7 percent. Recent data suggested that labor market conditions had eased further but remained solid. Over July and August, average monthly nonfarm payroll gains were less than their average second-quarter pace, the unemployment rate edged up to 4.2 percent, the labor force participation rate ticked up, and the employment-to-population ratio ticked down. The unemployment rate for African Americans moved down, while the rate for Hispanics rose, and both rates were above those for Asians and for Whites. The ratio of job vacancies to unemployment edged down to 1.1 in August, a bit below its level just before the pandemic. Job layoffs, as measured by initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits, remained low through August. Measures of nominal labor compensation continued to decelerate. Average hourly earnings for all employees rose 3.8 percent over the 12 months ending in August, and the four-quarter change in business-sector compensation per hour was 3.1 percent in the second quarter. Both measures were well below their pace from a year earlier. Real GDP rose solidly, on balance, over the first half of the year. Real private domestic final purchases (PDFP)—which comprises PCE and private fixed investment and which often provides a better signal than GDP of underlying economic momentum—posted a stronger first-half increase than GDP, and PDFP growth over the first half was only moderately slower than last year. Recent indicators for third- 4 September 17–18, 2024 quarter GDP and PDFP suggested that economic growth was continuing at a solid pace, particularly for PCE and business investment in equipment and intangibles. After growing at a tepid pace in the second quarter, real exports of goods moved down in July, led by declines in exports of autos and industrial supplies. By contrast, real imports of goods, especially of capital goods, continued to grow at a robust pace in July. Real GDP growth in foreign economies stepped down in the second quarter, and recent economic indicators suggested economic growth abroad remained subdued. Although services activity and high- tech manufacturing had been relatively robust, overall manufacturing activity remained weak, in part due to restrictive monetary policies. Weakness in manufacturing was particularly pronounced in Canada, Germany, and Mexico. In China, indicators of domestic demand remained weak. Inflation in economies abroad continued to abate, on net, though developments were mixed. In the AFEs excluding Japan, 12-month headline inflation ticked down but remained above target levels due to still-high services inflation. In the emerging market economies, inflation moved sideways, with some Latin American economies still experiencing upward inflation pressures from food prices. The BOE cut its policy rate for the first time in the current cycle, while the BOC, the ECB, and the Bank of Mexico eased policy further, in part citing progress toward achieving their inflation targets. By contrast, the BOJ continued to remove monetary accommodation. Staff Review of the Financial Situation The market-implied path for the federal funds rate declined notably over the intermeeting period. Similarly, options on interest rate futures suggested that market participants were placing higher odds on greater policy easing by early 2025 than they had just before the July FOMC meeting. Consistent with the downward shift in the implied policy rate path, nominal Treasury yields declined significantly, on net, with the most pronounced decreases at shorter horizons driven by reductions in both inflation compensation and real Treasury yields. Market-based measures of interest rate uncertainty in the near term rose notably, reportedly reflecting in part increased concerns among investors about downside risks to economic activity. Broad stock price indexes increased, on net, despite a sizable but temporary drop in early August. Yield spreads on investment- and speculative-grade corporate bonds were little changed, on net, and remained in the bottom quintile of their respective historical distributions. The one-month option- implied volatility on the S&P 500 index ended the period roughly unchanged, on net, after a large but temporary spike in early August. Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee 5 Overnight secured rates were largely unchanged, and conditions in U.S. short-term funding markets remained stable. Average usage of the ON RRP facility declined as net Treasury bill issuance increased, providing a more attractive alternative asset for money market funds. Market-based measures of the expected paths of policy rates as well as sovereign bond yields in most AFEs fell notably, largely in response to declines in U.S. interest rates. The broad dollar index declined, with the dollar depreciating significantly against AFE currencies amid a narrowing in interest rate differentials between the U.S. economy and AFEs. Financial markets were volatile early in the intermeeting period following the weaker-than-expected U.S. employment report and the policy rate increase by the BOJ, which led to the unwinding of some speculative trading positions. However, declines in equities mostly retraced over the following weeks, and moves in foreign risky asset prices were mixed over the intermeeting period. In domestic credit markets, borrowing costs remained elevated despite modest declines in most credit segments. Rates on 30-year conforming residential mortgages and yields on agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) declined, on net, but continued to be elevated. Interest rates on both new credit card offers and new auto loans were little changed and remained at elevated levels. Interest rates for newly originated commercial real estate (CRE) loans on banks’ books increased. Yields on an array of fixed-income securities, including investment- and speculative-grade corporate bonds and commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS), moved lower, generally following decreases in benchmark Treasury yields. Financing through capital markets and nonbank lenders was readily accessible for public corporations and for large and middle-market private corporations, and credit availability for leveraged loan borrowers remained solid. For smaller firms, however, credit availability remained moderately tight. Commercial and industrial loan balances at banks were little changed on net. Credit remained generally accessible to most CRE borrowers. CRE loans at banks continued to decelerate in July and were unchanged in August. Non-agency CMBS issuance was robust in August, while agency CMBS issuance slipped to a bit below its post-pandemic average. Credit remained available for most consumers, though credit growth showed signs of moderating. Auto lending continued to slow, while balances on credit cards increased moderately in July and August on average. In the residential mortgage market, access to credit was little changed overall and continued to be sensitive to borrowers’ credit risk attributes. Credit quality continued to be solid for large and midsize firms, home mortgage borrowers, and municipalities but kept deteriorating in other sectors. The credit quality of nonfinancial firms borrowing in the corporate bond and leveraged loan markets remained stable. Delinquency rates on loans to small businesses remained slightly above pre-pandemic levels. Credit quality in the CRE 6 September 17–18, 2024 market deteriorated further, with the average delinquency rate for loans in CMBS and the share of nonperforming CRE loans at banks both rising further. Regarding household credit quality, delinquency rates on most residential mortgages remained near pre-pandemic lows. Though consumer loan delinquency rates remained above pre-pandemic levels, the pace of increases had slowed. Delinquency rates for credit cards rose moderately in the second quarter, while they were largely flat for auto loans. Staff Economic Outlook The staff forecast at the September meeting was for the economy to remain solid, with real GDP growth about the same as in the forecast for the July meeting but the unemployment rate a little higher. Although real GDP growth in the second quarter was stronger than the staff had expected, the forecast for economic growth in the second half of this year was marked down, largely in response to recent softer-than-expected labor market indicators. The real GDP growth forecast for 2024 as a whole was little changed, though the unemployment rate was expected to be a little higher at the end of the year than previously forecast. Over 2025 through 2027, real GDP growth was expected to rise about in line with the staff’s estimate of potential output growth. The unemployment rate was expected to remain roughly flat from 2025 through 2027. All told, supply and demand in labor and product markets were forecast to be more balanced and resource utilization less tight than they had been in recent years. The staff’s inflation forecast was slightly lower than the one prepared for the previous meeting, primarily reflecting incoming data, along with the projection of a less tight economy. Both total and core PCE price inflation were expected to decline further as supply and demand in labor and product markets continued to move into better balance; by 2026, total and core inflation were expected to be 2 percent. The staff judged that the risks around the baseline forecast for economic activity were tilted to the downside, as the recent softening in some indicators of labor market conditions could point to greater slowing in aggregate demand growth than expected. The risks around the inflation forecast were seen as roughly balanced, reflecting both the further progress on disinflation and the effects of downside risks for economic activity on inflation. The staff continued to view the uncertainty around the baseline projection as close to the average over the past 20 years. Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, participants submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation for each year from 2024 through 2027 and over the longer run. These projections were based on participants’ individual assessments Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee 7 of appropriate monetary policy, including their projections of the federal funds rate. The longer-run projections represented each participant’s assessment of the rate to which each variable would tend to converge under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy. The Summary of Economic Projections was released to the public after the meeting. In their discussion of inflation developments, participants observed that inflation remained somewhat elevated, but almost all participants judged that recent monthly readings had been consistent with inflation returning sustainably to 2 percent. Some participants commented that, though food and energy prices had played an important part in the decline in the overall inflation rate, slower rates of price increases had become more evident across a broad range of goods and services. Notably, core goods prices had declined in recent months, and the rate of increase in core nonhousing services prices had moved down further. Many participants remarked that the recent inflation data were consistent with reports received from business contacts, who had indicated that their pricing power was limited or diminishing and that consumers were increasingly seeking discounts. Many participants also observed that inflation developments in the second and third quarters of 2024 suggested that the stronger-than-anticipated inflation readings in the first quarter had been only a temporary interruption of progress toward 2 percent. Participants remarked that even though the rate of increase in housing services prices had slowed, these prices were continuing to rise at an elevated rate, in contrast to many other core prices. With regard to the outlook for inflation, almost all participants indicated they had gained greater confidence that inflation was moving sustainably toward 2 percent. Participants cited various factors that were likely to put continuing downward pressure on inflation. These included a further modest slowing in real GDP growth, in part due to the Committee’s restrictive monetary policy stance; well- anchored inflation expectations; waning pricing power; increases in productivity; and a softening in world commodity prices. Several participants noted that nominal wage growth was continuing to slow, with a few participants citing signs that it was set to decline further. These signs included lower rates of increases in cyclically sensitive wages and data indicating that job switchers were no longer receiving a wage premium over other employees. A couple of participants remarked that, with wages being a relatively large portion of business costs in the services sector, that sector’s disinflation process would be particularly assisted by slower nominal wage growth. In addition, several participants observed that, with supply and demand in the labor market roughly in balance, wage increases were unlikely to be a source of general inflation pressures in the near future. With regard to housing services prices, some participants suggested that a more rapid disinflationary trend might emerge fairly soon, reflecting the slower pace of rent increases faced by new tenants. Participants emphasized that inflation remained somewhat elevated and that they were strongly committed to returning inflation to the Committee’s 2 percent objective. 8 September 17–18, 2024 Participants noted that labor market conditions had eased further in recent months and that, after being overheated in recent years, the labor market was now less tight than it had been just before the pandemic. As evidence, participants cited the slowdown in payroll employment growth and the uptick in the unemployment rate in the two employment reports received since the Committee’s July meeting, lower readings on hiring and job vacancies, reduced quits and job-finding rates, and widespread reports from business contacts of less difficulty in hiring workers. Some participants highlighted the fact that the unemployment rate had risen notably, on net, since April 2023. Participants noted, however, that labor market conditions remained solid, as layoffs had been limited and initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits had stayed low. Some participants stressed that, rather than using layoffs to lower their demand for labor, businesses had instead been taking steps such as posting fewer openings, reducing hours, or making use of attrition. A few participants suggested that firms remained reluctant to lay off workers after having difficulty obtaining employees earlier in the post-pandemic period. Some participants remarked that the recent pace of payroll increases had fallen short of what was required to keep the unemployment rate stable on a sustained basis, assuming a constant labor force participation rate. Many participants observed that the evaluation of labor market developments had been challenging, with increased immigration, revisions to reported payroll data, and possible changes in the underlying growth rate of productivity cited as complicating factors. Several participants emphasized the importance of continuing to use disaggregated data or information provided by business contacts as a check on readings on labor market conditions obtained from aggregate data. Participants agreed that labor market conditions were at, or close to, those consistent with the Committee’s longer-run goal of maximum employment. With regard to the outlook for the labor market, participants noted that further cooling did not appear to be needed to help bring inflation back to 2 percent. Participants indicated that in their baseline economic outlooks, which included an appropriate recalibration of the Committee’s monetary policy stance, the labor market would remain solid. Participants agreed that labor market indicators merited close monitoring, with some noting that as conditions in the labor market have eased, the risk had increased that continued easing could transition to a more serious deterioration. Participants observed that economic activity had continued to expand at a solid pace and highlighted resilient consumption spending. A couple of participants noted that rising real household incomes had bolstered consumption, though some cited signs of a slowing in expenditures or of strains on household budgets, including increased delinquencies in credit card and automobile loans. A couple of participants suggested that the financial strains being experienced by low- and moderate-income households would likely imply slower consumption growth in coming periods. Various participants reported that their business contacts were optimistic about the economic outlook, though they were exercising caution in their hiring and investment decisions. Participants noted that favorable Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee 9 aggregate supply developments, including increases in productivity, had contributed to the recent solid expansion of economic activity, and a few participants discussed possible implications of the introduction of new technology into the workplace. Many participants emphasized that they expected that real GDP would grow at roughly its trend rate over the next few years. Participants discussed the risks and uncertainties associated with the economic outlook. Almost all participants saw upside risks to the inflation outlook as having diminished, while downside risks to employment were seen as having increased. As a result, those participants now assessed the risks to achieving the Committee’s dual-mandate goals as being roughly in balance. A couple of participants, however, did not perceive an increased risk of a significant further weakening in labor market conditions. Several participants cited risks of a sharper-than-expected slowing in consumer spending in response to labor market cooling or to continuing strains on the budgets of low- and moderate- income households. Risks to achieving the Committee’s price-stability goal had diminished significantly since the target range for the federal funds rate was last raised, and the vast majority of participants saw the risks to inflation as broadly balanced. A couple of participants specifically noted upside inflation risks associated with geopolitical developments. In addition, some participants cited risks that progress toward the Committee’s 2 percent inflation objective could be stalled by a larger- than-anticipated easing in financial conditions, stronger-than-expected consumption growth, or continued strong increases in housing services prices. In their consideration of monetary policy at this meeting, participants noted that inflation had made further progress toward the Committee’s objective but remained somewhat elevated. Almost all participants expressed greater confidence that inflation was moving sustainably toward 2 percent. Participants also observed that recent indicators suggested that economic activity had continued to expand at a solid pace, job gains had slowed, and the unemployment rate had moved up but remained low. Almost all participants judged that the risks to achieving the Committee’s employment and inflation goals were roughly in balance. In light of the progress on inflation and the balance of risks, all participants agreed that it was appropriate to ease the stance of monetary policy. Given the significant progress made since the Committee first set its target range for the federal funds rate at 5¼ to 5½ percent, a substantial majority of participants supported lowering the target range for the federal funds rate by 50 basis points to 4¾ to 5 percent. These participants generally observed that such a recalibration of the stance of monetary policy would begin to bring it into better alignment with recent indicators of inflation and the labor market. They also emphasized that such a move would help sustain the strength in the economy and the labor market while continuing to promote progress on inflation, and would reflect the balance of risks. Some participants noted that there had been a plausible case for a 25 basis point rate cut at the previous meeting and that data over the intermeeting period had provided further evidence that inflation was on a sustainable path toward 10 September 17–18, 2024 2 percent while the labor market continued to cool. However, noting that inflation was still somewhat elevated while economic growth remained solid and unemployment remained low, some participants observed that they would have preferred a 25 basis point reduction of the target range at this meeting, and a few others indicated that they could have supported such a decision. Several participants noted that a 25 basis point reduction would be in line with a gradual path of policy normalization that would allow policymakers time to assess the degree of policy restrictiveness as the economy evolved. A few participants also added that a 25 basis point move could signal a more predictable path of policy normalization. A few participants remarked that the overall path of policy normalization, rather than the specific amount of initial easing at this meeting, would be more important in determining the degree of policy restriction. Participants judged that it was appropriate to continue the process of reducing the Federal Reserve’s securities holdings. In discussing the outlook for monetary policy, participants anticipated that if the data came in about as expected, with inflation moving down sustainably to 2 percent and the economy near maximum employment, it would likely be appropriate to move toward a more neutral stance of policy over time. Participants emphasized that it was important to communicate that the recalibration of the stance of policy at this meeting should not be interpreted as evidence of a less favorable economic outlook or as a signal that the pace of policy easing would be more rapid than participants’ assessments of the appropriate path. Those who commented on the degree of restrictiveness of monetary policy observed that they believed it to be restrictive, though they expressed a range of views about the degree of restrictiveness. Participants generally remarked on the importance of communicating that the Committee’s monetary policy decisions are conditional on the evolution of the economy and the implications for the economic outlook and balance of risks and therefore not on a preset course. Several participants discussed the importance of communicating that the ongoing reduction in the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet could continue for some time even as the Committee reduced its target range for the federal funds rate. In discussing risk-management considerations that could bear on the outlook for monetary policy, almost all participants agreed that the upside risks to inflation had diminished, and most remarked that the downside risks to employment had increased. Some participants emphasized that reducing policy restraint too late or too little could risk unduly weakening economic activity and employment. A few participants highlighted in particular the costs and challenges of addressing such a weakening once it is fully under way. Several participants remarked that reducing policy restraint too soon or too much could risk a stalling or a reversal of the progress on inflation. Some participants noted that uncertainties concerning the level of the longer-term neutral rate of interest complicated the assessment of the degree of restrictiveness of policy and, in their view, made it appropriate to reduce policy restraint gradually. Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee 11 Committee Policy Actions In their discussions of monetary policy for this meeting, members agreed that economic activity had continued to expand at a solid pace. Job gains had slowed, and the unemployment rate had moved up but remained low. Members concurred that there had been further progress toward the Committee’s 2 percent inflation objective but that inflation remained somewhat elevated. Almost all members agreed that to appropriately reflect cumulative developments related to inflation and the balance of risks, the postmeeting statement should note that they had gained greater confidence that inflation was moving sustainably toward 2 percent and judged that the risks to achieving the Committee’s employment and inflation goals were roughly in balance. Members viewed the economic outlook as uncertain and agreed that they were attentive to the risks to both sides of the Committee’s dual mandate. In light of the progress on inflation and the balance of risks, the Committee decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate to 4¾ to 5 percent. One member voted against that decision, preferring to lower the target range for the federal funds rate to 5 to 5¼ percent. Members concurred that, in considering additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, they would carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. Members agreed to continue to reduce the Federal Reserve’s holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency MBS. All members agreed that the postmeeting statement should affirm their strong commitment both to supporting maximum employment and to returning inflation to the Committee’s 2 percent objective. Members agreed that, in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, they would continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. They would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerged that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals. Members also agreed that their assessments would take into account a wide range of information, including readings on labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Open Market Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive, for release at 2:00 p.m.: “Effective September 19, 2024, the Federal Open Market Committee directs the Desk to: • Undertake open market operations as necessary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of 4¾ to 5 percent. 12 September 17–18, 2024 • Conduct standing overnight repurchase agreement operations with a minimum bid rate of 5 percent and with an aggregate operation limit of $500 billion. • Conduct standing overnight reverse repurchase agreement operations at an offering rate of 4.8 percent and with a per-counterparty limit of $160 billion per day. • Roll over at auction the amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of Treasury securities maturing in each calendar month that exceeds a cap of $25 billion per month. Redeem Treasury coupon securities up to this monthly cap and Treasury bills to the extent that coupon principal payments are less than the monthly cap. • Reinvest the amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) received in each calendar month that exceeds a cap of $35 billion per month into Treasury securities to roughly match the maturity composition of Treasury securities outstanding. • Allow modest deviations from stated amounts for reinvestments, if needed for operational reasons. • Engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal Reserve’s agency MBS transactions.” The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below for release at 2:00 p.m.: “Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace. Job gains have slowed, and the unemployment rate has moved up but remains low. Inflation has made further progress toward the Committee’s 2 percent objective but remains somewhat elevated. The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. The Committee has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent, and judges that the risks to achieving its employment and inflation goals are roughly in balance. The economic outlook is uncertain, and the Committee is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate. In light of the progress on inflation and the balance of risks, the Committee decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by ½ percentage point to 4¾ to 5 percent. In considering additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. The Committee will continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee 13 agency mortgage-backed securities. The Committee is strongly committed to supporting maximum employment and returning inflation to its 2 percent objective. In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals. The Committee’s assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.” Voting for this action: Jerome H. Powell, John C. Williams, Thomas I. Barkin, Michael S. Barr, Raphael W. Bostic, Lisa D. Cook, Mary C. Daly, Beth M. Hammack, Philip N. Jefferson, Adriana D. Kugler, and Christopher J. Waller. Voting against this action: Michelle W. Bowman. Governor Bowman preferred at this meeting to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 5 to 5¼ percent in light of core inflation remaining well above the Committee’s objective, a labor market that is near full employment, and solid underlying growth. She also expressed her concern that the Committee’s larger policy action could be seen as a premature declaration of victory on the price-stability part of the dual mandate. Consistent with the Committee’s decision to lower the target range for the federal funds rate to 4¾ to 5 percent, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted unanimously to lower the interest rate paid on reserve balances at 4.9 percent, effective September 19, 2024. The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted unanimously to approve a ½ percentage point decrease in the primary credit rate to 5 percent, effective September 19, 2024.2 It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Wednesday–Thursday, November 6–7, 2024. The meeting adjourned at 10:30 a.m. on September 18, 2024. Notation Vote By notation vote completed on August 20, 2024, the Committee unanimously approved the minutes of the Committee meeting held on July 30–31, 2024. 2 In taking this action, the Board approved a request to establish that rate submitted by the board of directors of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta. The vote also encompassed approval by the Board of Governors of the establishment of a 5 percent primary credit rate by the remaining Federal Reserve Banks, effective on September 19, 2024, or the date such Reserve Banks inform the Secretary of the Board of such a request. (Secretary's note: Subsequently, the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco were informed of the Board’s approval of their establishment of a primary credit rate of 5 percent, effect September 19, 2024.) 14 September 17–18, 2024 Attendance Jerome H.

{"date": "2024-11-07", "year": 2024, "source_type": "FOMC Minutes", "url": "https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20241107.pdf", "text": "1 Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee November 6–7, 2024 A joint meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System was held in the offices of the Board of Governors on Wednesday, November 6, 2024, at 10:00 a.m. and continued on Thursday, November 7, 2024, at 9:00 a.m.1 Developments in Financial Markets and Open Market Operations The manager turned first to a review of developments in financial markets. Nominal Treasury yields rose notably over the period; factors driving the increases in yields included stronger-than-expected data releases and monetary policy communications that were interpreted as signaling a more gradual pace of policy easing than previously thought. The rise at short maturities reflected increases in both real yields and inflation compensation, while the rise at longer maturities was primarily driven by increases in real yields. Broad equity prices also rose over the period, likely reflecting in part the solid incoming data and consequent lower odds of a weakening in the economic outlook. The VIX, which measures 30-day option-implied volatility of broad equity prices, had moved higher in the period leading up to the November elections and then decreased following Election Day. The manager noted that the federal funds rate path had shifted up notably over the period, as measured by both the options-implied modal path and the futures-implied average path. Although the futures-implied path remained below the options-implied path at longer horizons, the gap between the two paths narrowed, likely reflecting market participants’ judgment that risks had become less skewed toward the downside. In the Open Market Desk’s Survey of Primary Dealers and Survey of Market Participants, a large majority of respondents had a modal expectation of a 25 basis point cut at this meeting and another 25 basis point cut at the December meeting. Further out, there was considerably more uncertainty. For example, although the mean of the average respondent’s probability distribution for the federal funds rate at the trough of this easing cycle was close to the average respondent’s expected longer-run level of the federal funds rate, respondents placed substantial weight on a wide range of outcomes. The manager also discussed balance sheet policy expectations. The average of the survey responses indicated that the modal expectation regarding the timing of the end of balance sheet runoff had 1 The Federal Open Market Committee is referenced as the “FOMC” and the “Committee” in these minutes; the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System is referenced as the “Board” in these minutes. 2 November 6–7, 2024 shifted a bit later, to May 2025. These responses remained dispersed, though roughly two-thirds of respondents expected an end to runoff in either the first or the second quarter of 2025. Survey results indicated that respondents expected balance sheet runoff to continue alongside rate cuts for several more months; the surveys therefore suggested that the Committee’s two policy tools—the policy rate and the balance sheet—were not seen as working at cross-purposes. Regarding international developments, the manager noted that policy rate expectations for the year- end declined in most advanced foreign economies (AFEs), with the exception of Australia and the U.K. The widening of differentials with U.S. interest rates had likely contributed to an increase in the trade- weighted dollar index, which reached its highest level this year. The manager then turned to money markets and Desk operations. Unsecured overnight rates remained stable over the intermeeting period. In secured funding markets, rates on overnight repurchase agreements (repo) increased sharply and were volatile around the September quarter-end but, on other dates, generally stayed just above the rate offered at the overnight reverse repurchase agreement (ON RRP) facility. Market contacts attributed the pressures seen around the quarter-end to a combination of typical balance sheet constraints associated with financial reporting dates and a large net settlement of Treasury coupon securities that took place on the same day. Overall, developments in the repo market at the end of September and in early October appeared to conform with the typical quarter-end pattern, although the spike in repo rates observed on those days was the largest in the post-pandemic period. The September quarter-end also saw the first non-test use of the standing repo facility (SRF), with two counterparties borrowing $2.6 billion. The manager noted that the relatively small utilization was not surprising, as repo rates in the noncentrally cleared segment of the triparty repo market—in which the facility operates—did not exceed the SRF rate for the most part. The manager also observed that there was a substantial volume of trades taking place above the SRF rate around quarter-end in other segments of the repo market. The manager indicated that, with dealers typically earning a spread in their intermediation activity, this outcome was not surprising. The manager suggested that considerations related to market structure also helped explain why repo rates were above the SRF rate in those segments at quarter-end. Overall, the manager judged that the SRF performed about in line with the Desk’s expectations. Usage of the ON RRP facility declined about $140 billion over the intermeeting period. This decline appeared to be driven primarily by additional net Treasury bill supply in recent weeks, which made Treasury bill yields more attractive. The manager also noted that, of late, the largest ON RRP participants had substantially reduced their participation at the facility, leading to a less concentrated configuration of ON RRP take-up than had been the case for some time. Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee 3 Over the intermeeting period, pricing in the federal funds market continued to be insensitive to day-to- day changes in the supply of reserves. The manager noted that this outcome was consistent with reserves remaining abundant and that various other indicators pointed to the same conclusion. The staff also provided an informational briefing to the Committee on two considerations related to the management of the balance sheet over the near term. The first consideration focused on the possibility of a technical adjustment to the ON RRP offering rate. The staff reviewed developments with respect to the usage of the ON RRP facility. The staff also noted that lowering the ON RRP offering rate 5 basis points would align the ON RRP offering rate with the bottom of the target range for the federal funds rate and would probably put some downward pressure on other money market rates. The second consideration focused on the possible implications for the composition of Federal Reserve liabilities stemming from the federal debt limit potentially being reinstated in 2025. The staff presentation highlighted the fact that, should this event occur, a drawdown in the Treasury General Account (TGA) balances would increase the sum of reserves and ON RRP balances, and that a subsequent rebuilding of TGA balances would have the reverse effect. The staff noted that these substantial shifts could mask the effects of ongoing balance sheet runoff on money market conditions and pose challenges in assessing reserve conditions. By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk’s domestic transactions over the intermeeting period. There were no intervention operations in foreign currencies for the System’s account during the intermeeting period. Staff Review of the Economic Situation The information available at the time of the meeting indicated that real gross domestic product (GDP) had expanded solidly so far this year. The pace of job gains had moderated since the beginning of the year, and the unemployment rate had moved up, on net, but remained low. Consumer price inflation was well below its year-earlier pace. Consumer price inflation—as measured by the 12-month change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE)—had moved lower in August and September. Total PCE price inflation was 2.1 percent in September, and core PCE price inflation—which excludes changes in energy prices and many consumer food prices—was 2.7 percent. Recent data suggested that labor market conditions remained solid. Average monthly nonfarm payroll gains in the third quarter were similar to those seen in the second quarter. October job gains were held down noticeably by the effects of strikes and hurricanes. The unemployment rate had edged down slightly since August and was 4.1 percent in October; the labor force participation rate also 4 November 6–7, 2024 ticked down over this period, and the employment-to-population ratio was unchanged on net. The unemployment rates for African Americans and for Hispanics moved down; both rates were above those for Asians and for Whites. The ratio of job vacancies to unemployment was 1.1 in October, slightly lower than its level just before the pandemic. Average hourly earnings for all employees rose 4 percent over the 12 months ending in October, down 0.3 percentage point relative to a year earlier, and the 12-month change in the employment cost index of hourly compensation for private industry workers was 3.6 percent in September, down 0.7 percentage point from its year-earlier pace. According to the advance release, real GDP posted a solid gain in the third quarter that was similar to its second-quarter pace. Real private domestic final purchases—which comprises PCE and private fixed investment and which often provides a better signal than GDP of underlying economic momentum—rose slightly faster than real GDP in the third quarter. Net exports were a drag on third- quarter real GDP growth, as a brisk rise in exports was outpaced by even faster import growth. Real GDP growth in foreign economies picked up somewhat in the third quarter, including in the euro area and, especially, Mexico. In China, growth also firmed in the third quarter, and there were signs that recent fiscal stimulus measures were starting to shore up confidence. That said, more recent indicators, such as purchasing managers indexes (PMIs), continued to suggest ongoing weakness in foreign manufacturing, in part due to monetary policies still being restrictive. Inflation abroad continued to ease. In the advanced AFEs excluding Japan, 12-month headline inflation slowed to near or below target levels, mainly reflecting the rapid pass-through of lower energy prices earlier this year. At the same time, services inflation remained high in these economies. In China, core inflation fell to its lowest level since the Global Financial Crisis. By contrast, in some Latin American countries, notably Brazil, inflation increased, partly because of renewed food price pressures. Many foreign central banks eased policy during the intermeeting period, including the Bank of Canada and the European Central Bank among the AFEs and the central banks of Colombia, Mexico, Korea, the Philippines, and Thailand among the emerging market economies. Staff Review of the Financial Situation The expected path of the federal funds rate implied by financial market quotes increased notably over the intermeeting period amid stronger-than-expected data releases pertaining to economic activity, somewhat higher-than-expected readings on inflation, and comments by some FOMC participants that were interpreted as signaling a more gradual approach to recalibrating the stance of monetary policy. Consistent with a higher expected path of the federal funds rate and a shift in investors’ perceptions of the balance of risks, nominal Treasury yields across the maturity spectrum increased significantly. Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee 5 The increase in longer-term yields appeared to be mostly attributable to higher term premiums— consistent with investors’ perceived shift in the balance of risks away from outcomes characterized by slower real GDP growth and lower inflation. Market-based measures of inflation compensation moved up over the period from relatively low levels, while survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations were little changed. These measures continued to suggest an expectation that inflation would return over time to the Committee’s 2 percent objective. Despite higher yields, and amid greater confidence about the growth outlook and somewhat better- than-expected corporate earnings reports, broad equity price indexes increased notably, on net, over the intermeeting period, and credit spreads for both corporate and municipal bonds narrowed. The VIX rose appreciably, reportedly reflecting uncertainty about the outcome of the U.S. presidential election and escalating tensions in the Middle East. However, it subsequently more than retraced those increases, ending the period moderately lower and slightly below the median of its historical distribution. Conditions in U.S. short-term funding markets remained generally stable over the intermeeting period, with the lowering of the target range for the federal funds rate in September fully passing through to both secured and unsecured reference rates. Rates in secured markets exhibited significant but temporary upward pressure around the September quarter-end, driven by typical quarter-end dynamics and a large net Treasury coupon settlement. Over the intermeeting period, government money market funds (MMFs) continued to increase allocations to Treasury bills and private repo in light of the generally favorable rates on these instruments; usage of the ON RRP facility declined significantly over the period. Over the intermeeting period, foreign financial markets were driven by greater investor confidence in the U.S. economic outlook, foreign economic data releases, and political developments. Higher U.S. Treasury yields spilled over to foreign yields across the curve, though softer-than-expected inflation and PMI survey data weighed on short-term yields in the euro area. In the U.K., yields increased following the release of the new government’s budget as market participants processed the budget’s impact on projected inflation and gilt issuance. The broad dollar index increased significantly, as U.S. interest rates rose more than foreign rates. In China, the announcement of new policy stimulus measures boosted domestic risky asset prices, with limited spillovers to other markets; the announcements also drove notable flows into China-focused investment funds. Most European equity price indexes decreased somewhat, while Japanese and Canadian equity markets rose moderately. In domestic credit markets, borrowing costs for households and most businesses rose over the intermeeting period from already elevated levels, primarily reflecting increases in longer-term Treasury yields. Rates on 30-year fixed-rate conforming residential mortgages rose, while interest rates on 6 November 6–7, 2024 credit cards remained relatively unchanged at near historical highs. By contrast, interest rates on new auto loans edged down but remained elevated. Meanwhile, interest rates on commercial and industrial (C&I) loans and small business loans continued to be elevated. Yields also rose on an array of fixed-income securities, including commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS), investment- and speculative-grade corporate bonds, and residential mortgage-backed securities. Over the intermeeting period, financing through capital markets and nonbank lenders remained broadly available for public corporations and for large and midsize private corporations. For smaller firms, however, credit availability remained relatively tight. In the October Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices (SLOOS), banks, on net, reported maintaining their lending standards and most terms basically unchanged for C&I loans.2 Meanwhile, net growth in C&I loan balances remained subdued in August and September. With respect to commercial real estate (CRE) loans, banks in the October SLOOS reported, on balance, basically unchanged lending standards for all categories of CRE loans, the first survey since early 2022 in which standards on CRE loans of every category have not tightened. Bank CRE loan balances were flat in the third quarter, partly reflecting lending standards staying on the tighter end of the range prevailing since 2005. Credit remained available for most consumers, although consumer credit availability continued to tighten moderately through September. Credit card balances expanded modestly in the third quarter, while auto credit growth continued to slow through August. In the October SLOOS, respondents, on net, indicated that standards for credit cards tightened, but most of them reported no change in lending standards for auto loans. Access to credit in the residential mortgage market was little changed, on balance, and continued to depend on borrowers’ credit risk attributes. In the October SLOOS, banks, on net, moderately eased residential lending standards. Credit quality remained solid in the cases of large and midsize firms, most home mortgage borrowers, and municipalities, but it continued to deteriorate in other sectors. The credit quality of nonfinancial firms borrowing in the corporate bond and leveraged loan markets remained stable. Delinquency rates on loans to small businesses remained modestly above pre-pandemic levels. Credit quality in the CRE market deteriorated further, with the average delinquency rate on loans in CMBS pools rising further in September, driven largely by office loans. Regarding household credit quality, delinquency rates on most residential mortgages were largely unchanged in September at about their historical low. Delinquency rates for credit cards increased a bit further in the third quarter, while delinquency rates on auto loans inched down. 2 The SLOOS results reported are based on banks’ responses, weighted by each bank’s outstanding loans in the respective loan category, and might therefore differ from the results reported in the published SLOOS, which are based on banks’ unweighted responses. Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee 7 The staff provided an update on its assessment of the stability of the U.S. financial system and, on balance, continued to characterize the system’s financial vulnerabilities as notable. The staff judged that asset valuation pressures were elevated, with estimates of risk premiums across key markets low by historical standards. House prices remained elevated relative to fundamentals such as rents. Although the pace of decline in CRE prices slowed, fundamentals continued to deteriorate across multiple categories. Vulnerabilities associated with business and household debt were characterized as moderate. Nonfinancial business leverage was elevated by historical standards, but the ability of publicly traded firms to service their debt remained strong, supported by robust earnings and the low interest rates that firms continued to enjoy on the portion of fixed-rate debt issued early in the pandemic. That said, the fraction of private firm debt having very low interest coverage ratios continued to increase, pointing to further deterioration in the balance sheets of riskier firms. Household balance sheets remained solid overall, as aggregate home equity remained high and delinquencies on mortgage loans continued to be low. Vulnerabilities associated with leverage in the financial sector were characterized as notable. Regulatory capital ratios in the banking sector remained high; however, banks continued to hold large quantities of long-duration assets, leaving them more exposed than usual to an unexpected rise in longer-term interest rates. In the nonbank sector, leverage at hedge funds remained high, partly on account of the prevalence of the Treasury cash–futures basis trade. Life insurers’ leverage remained somewhat elevated, and they continued to maintain large holdings of risky and illiquid securities. By contrast, broker-dealer leverage remained low, as their capital increased in line with their assets. Vulnerabilities associated with funding risks were also characterized as notable. Assets in prime MMFs and other runnable cash-management vehicles remained near historical highs. Life insurers’ greater reliance on nontraditional liabilities suggested that adverse shocks to the industry could trigger substantial funding pressures at these firms. Staff Economic Outlook The staff forecast at the November meeting called for economic conditions to remain solid. Relative to September, the real GDP growth projection for 2024 as a whole was higher, reflecting stronger- than-expected spending and labor market indicators. The staff had revised up their assessment of potential output growth in light of the upward revisions to productivity implied by the recent annual update of the national income and product accounts. From 2025 to 2027, real GDP growth was expected to be slightly slower than potential output growth, resulting in a very small increase in the unemployment rate. 8 November 6–7, 2024 The staff’s inflation forecast for 2024 was slightly higher than the one prepared for the previous meeting, reflecting incoming data. Thereafter, the outlook was similar to the previous projection: Both total and core PCE price inflation were expected to decline further as supply and demand in labor and product markets continued to move into better balance; by 2026, total and core inflation were expected to be 2 percent. The staff continued to view the uncertainty around the baseline projection as close to the average over the past 20 years. The staff had reduced its assessment of the downward risks to the baseline forecast for economic activity in light of incoming data. Nevertheless, the staff judged that these risks were somewhat skewed to the downside: Although current labor market conditions remained solid, it was possible that the easing in the labor market seen over the past two years could give way to a more pronounced slowdown in economic activity. The risks around the inflation forecast were seen as roughly balanced. Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook In their discussion of inflation developments, participants continued to observe that inflation had eased substantially from its peak, although core inflation remained somewhat elevated. Almost all participants judged that, though month-to-month movements would remain volatile, incoming data generally remained consistent with inflation returning sustainably to 2 percent. Participants commented that disinflationary progress had been seen across a broad range of core goods and services prices. Notably, in both the core goods and nonhousing services categories, prices were now increasing at rates close to those seen during earlier periods of price stability. Many participants noted that the slowing in these components of core inflation corroborated reports received from their business contacts that firms were more reluctant to increase prices, as consumers appeared to be more price sensitive and were increasingly seeking discounts. Some participants remarked that although increases in housing services prices remained somewhat elevated, they continued to expect that these increases would slow, as the more subdued pace of rent increases faced by new tenants would eventually be reflected further in housing services prices. With regard to the outlook for inflation, participants indicated that they remained confident that inflation was moving sustainably toward 2 percent, although a couple noted the possibility that the process could take longer than previously expected. A few participants remarked that insofar as recent robust increases in real GDP reflected favorable supply developments, the strength of economic activity was unlikely to be a source of upward inflation pressures. Participants cited various factors likely to put continuing downward pressure on inflation, including waning business pricing power, the Committee’s still-restrictive monetary policy stance, and well-anchored longer-term inflation expectations. Several participants noted that nominal wage growth had continued to move down and Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee 9 that the wage premium available to job switchers had diminished. In addition, some participants observed that, with supply and demand in the labor market being roughly in balance and in light of recent productivity gains, wage increases were unlikely to be a source of inflationary pressure in the near future. In discussing labor market developments, participants generally viewed recent readings as consistent with labor market conditions remaining solid, although labor strikes and the devastating hurricanes had been important sources of temporary fluctuations in the employment data. Participants continued to cite declines in job vacancies, the quits rate, and turnover as consistent with a gradual easing in labor demand. Some participants reported that businesses were becoming more selective in hiring as they faced larger pools of more qualified job applicants, and job applicants were more willing to accept less accommodative work arrangements and more moderate wage offers. Participants generally noted, however, that there was no sign of rapid deterioration in labor market conditions, with layoffs remaining low. A few participants cited business contacts who were using attrition, instead of layoffs, to manage the size of their workforce. Some participants observed that the evaluation of underlying trends in labor market developments had continued to be challenging— with difficulties in measuring the effects of immigration on labor supply, revisions to data, and the effects of natural disasters and labor strikes among the factors cited as complicating this evaluation—and that assessments of the outlook for the labor market were associated with considerable uncertainty. Participants generally judged that current labor market conditions were broadly consistent with the Committee’s longer-run goal of maximum employment. With regard to the outlook for the labor market, participants generally anticipated that with an appropriate recalibration of the Committee’s monetary policy stance over time, the labor market would remain solid. Participants generally agreed that labor market indicators merited close monitoring. Some participants still saw elevated risks that the labor market could deteriorate, though many participants saw the risk of an excessive cooling in the labor market as having diminished somewhat since the Committee’s September meeting. Participants observed that recent data on economic activity and consumer spending were largely stronger than anticipated, and they assessed that economic activity had continued to expand at a solid pace and consumer spending remained strong. Participants remarked that consumption had been supported by a solid labor market, rising real wages, and elevated household wealth. Many participants observed that recent upward revisions in data on household income and the saving rate had made these series’ behavior more consistent with the strength in consumer spending. However, several participants cautioned that low- and moderate-income households continued to experience financial strains, which could damp their spending. A couple of participants cited recent increases in rates of delinquencies on credit card borrowing and automobile loans as signs of such strains. 10 November 6–7, 2024 Regarding the business sector, a few participants noted that favorable aggregate supply developments—including increases in labor supply, business investment, and productivity—continued to support solid expansion of business activity. A couple of participants remarked that there was considerable uncertainty about the durability of recent rates of increase in productivity. Although a few participants attributed some of the productivity gains to potentially transitory factors—such as one- time efficiency gains in response to earlier labor shortages—or the possible underestimation of labor inputs, some participants highlighted more durable factors, such as new business formation and investment, as well as the integration into the workplace of technological advances. A couple of participants discussed some of these recent trends, noting especially possible implications of the expanded use of artificial intelligence in the workplace. Several participants indicated that their District contacts reported larger corporations and firms in sectors like financial services, construction, professional services, and technology as having a generally more optimistic outlook than smaller businesses or firms in the manufacturing sector. Several participants remarked that the agricultural sector continued to face significant strains due to low crop prices and high input costs. In participants’ evaluation of the risks and uncertainties associated with the economic outlook, upside risks to the inflation outlook were seen as little changed, while downside risks to employment and growth were seen as having decreased somewhat. Among the upside risks to inflation cited by participants were the possibility of sudden disruptions in global supply chains due to geopolitical developments, a larger-than-anticipated easing in financial conditions, stronger-than-expected consumption, more-persistent shelter price increases, or sharp rises in insurance charges for health, autos, or homes. Some participants pointed to various downside risks to economic activity and employment, including weaker global growth, sharply worsening financing conditions due to an escalation of geopolitical tensions or a sizable asset price correction, or an unwelcome weakening of the labor market. Almost all participants judged the risks to the attainment of their dual-mandate objectives of maximum employment and price stability to be roughly in balance. In their discussion of financial stability, participants who commented noted vulnerabilities to the financial system that they assessed warranted monitoring. A couple of participants observed that the banking system was sound but that there continued to be potential risks associated with unrealized losses on bank assets. Many participants discussed vulnerabilities associated with CRE exposures, focusing on risks in the office sector. A few of these participants noted signs that the deterioration of conditions in this sector of the CRE market might be lessening. A couple of participants noted concerns about asset valuation pressures in other markets. Some participants commented on cyber risks that could impair the operation of financial institutions, financial infrastructure, and, potentially, the overall economy; these participants noted, in particular, vulnerabilities that could emanate from third-party service providers. A couple of participants also mentioned third-party service providers in Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee 11 the context of risks associated with brokered and reciprocal deposit arrangements. Several participants noted that leverage in the market for Treasury securities remained a risk and commented that it would be important to monitor developments regarding the market’s resilience. A few participants discussed vulnerabilities posed by the growth of private credit and potential links to banks and other financial institutions. A couple of participants commented on the financial condition of low- and moderate-income households that have exhausted their savings and the importance of monitoring rising delinquency rates on credit cards and auto loans. A couple of participants remarked on the successful implementation of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s money fund rules, noting that it would reduce financial stability risks posed by domestic MMFs. In their consideration of monetary policy at this meeting, participants noted that inflation had made progress toward the Committee’s objective but remained somewhat elevated. Participants also observed that recent indicators suggested that economic activity had continued to expand at a solid pace, labor market conditions had generally eased since earlier in the year, and the unemployment rate had moved up but remained low. Almost all participants judged that the risks to achieving the Committee's employment and inflation goals were roughly in balance. In support of the Committee’s goals, all participants viewed it as appropriate to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 4½ to 4¾ percent. Participants observed that such a further recalibration of the monetary policy stance would help maintain the strength in the economy and the labor market while continuing to enable further progress on inflation. Participants judged that it was appropriate to continue the process of reducing the Federal Reserve’s securities holdings. In discussing the outlook for monetary policy, participants anticipated that if the data came in about as expected, with inflation continuing to move down sustainably to 2 percent and the economy remaining near maximum employment, it would likely be appropriate to move gradually toward a more neutral stance of policy over time. Participants noted that monetary policy decisions were not on a preset course and were conditional on the evolution of the economy and the implications for the economic outlook and the balance of risks; they stressed that it would be important for the Committee to make this clear as it adjusted its policy stance. While emphasizing that monetary policy would be data dependent, many participants noted the volatility of recent economic data and highlighted the importance of focusing on underlying economic trends and the evolution of the outlook when assessing incoming information. Some participants remarked that, at a future meeting, there would be value in the Committee considering a technical adjustment to the rate offered at the ON RRP facility to set the rate equal to the bottom of the target range for the federal funds rate, thereby bringing the rate back into an alignment that had existed when the facility was established as a monetary policy tool. 12 November 6–7, 2024 In discussing risk-management considerations that could bear on the outlook for monetary policy, almost all participants agreed that risks to achieving the Committee’s employment and inflation goals remained roughly in balance. Some participants judged that downside risks to economic activity or the labor market had diminished. Participants noted that monetary policy would need to balance the risks of easing policy too quickly, thereby possibly hindering further progress on inflation, with the risks of easing policy too slowly, thereby unduly weakening economic activity and employment. In discussing the positioning of monetary policy in response to potential changes in the balance of risks, some participants noted that the Committee could pause its easing of the policy rate and hold it at a restrictive level if inflation remained elevated, and some remarked that policy easing could be accelerated if the labor market turned down or economic activity faltered. Many participants observed that uncertainties concerning the level of the neutral rate of interest complicated the assessment of the degree of restrictiveness of monetary policy and, in their view, made it appropriate to reduce policy restraint gradually. Committee Policy Actions In their discussions of monetary policy for this meeting, members agreed that economic activity had continued to expand at a solid pace. Labor market conditions had generally eased since earlier in the year, and the unemployment rate had moved up but remained low. Members concurred that inflation had made progress toward the Committee’s 2 percent inflation objective but that inflation remained somewhat elevated. In discussing the Committee’s statement, members agreed that it was appropriate to omit the previous reference to their greater confidence that inflation was moving sustainably toward 2 percent, as this language had been specifically associated with the commencement of policy easing in September and therefore was no longer needed. Almost all members agreed that the risks to achieving the Committee’s employment and inflation goals were roughly in balance. Members viewed the economic outlook as uncertain and agreed that they were attentive to the risks to both sides of the Committee’s dual mandate. In support of its goals, the Committee decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 4½ to 4¾ percent. Members concurred that, in considering additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, they would carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. Members agreed to continue to reduce the Federal Reserve’s holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities. All members agreed that the postmeeting statement should affirm their strong commitment both to supporting maximum employment and to returning inflation to the Committee’s 2 percent objective. Members agreed that, in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, they would continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. They would be prepared to Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee 13 adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerged that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals. Members also agreed that their assessments would take into account a wide range of information, including readings on labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Open Market Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive, for release at 2:00 p.m.: “Effective November 8, 2024, the Federal Open Market Committee directs the Desk to: • Undertake open market operations as necessary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of 4½ to 4¾ percent. • Conduct standing overnight repurchase agreement operations with a minimum bid rate of 4.75 percent and with an aggregate operation limit of $500 billion. • Conduct standing overnight reverse repurchase agreement operations at an offering rate of 4.55 percent and with a per-counterparty limit of $160 billion per day. • Roll over at auction the amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of Treasury securities maturing in each calendar month that exceeds a cap of $25 billion per month. Redeem Treasury coupon securities up to this monthly cap and Treasury bills to the extent that coupon principal payments are less than the monthly cap. • Reinvest the amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) received in each calendar month that exceeds a cap of $35 billion per month into Treasury securities to roughly match the maturity composition of Treasury securities outstanding. • Allow modest deviations from stated amounts for reinvestments, if needed for operational reasons. • Engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal Reserve’s agency MBS transactions.” The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below for release at 2:00 p.m.: “Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace. Since earlier in the year, labor market conditions have generally eased, and the unemployment rate has moved up but remains low. Inflation has made progress toward the Committee’s 2 percent objective but remains somewhat elevated. 14 November 6–7, 2024 The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. The Committee judges that the risks to achieving its employment and inflation goals are roughly in balance. The economic outlook is uncertain, and the Committee is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate. In support of its goals, the Committee decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by ¼ percentage point to 4½ to 4¾ percent. In considering additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. The Committee will continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities. The Committee is strongly committed to supporting maximum employment and returning inflation to its 2 percent objective. In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals. The Committee’s assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.” Voting for this action: Jerome H. Powell, John C. Williams, Thomas I. Barkin, Michael S. Barr, Raphael W. Bostic, Michelle W. Bowman, Lisa D. Cook, Mary C. Daly, Beth M. Hammack, Philip N. Jefferson, Adriana D. Kugler, and Christopher J. Waller. Voting against this action: None. Consistent with the Committee’s decision to lower the target range for the federal funds rate to 4½ to 4¾ percent, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted unanimously to lower the interest rate paid on reserve balances to 4.65 percent, effective November 8, 2024. The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted unanimously to approve a ¼ percentage point decrease in the primary credit rate to 4.75 percent, effective November 8, 2024.3 3 In taking this action, the Board approved requests to establish that rate submitted by the Board of Directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis, Dallas, and San Francisco. The vote also encompassed approval by the Board of Governors of the establishment of a 4.75 percent primary credit rate by the remaining Federal Reserve Banks, effective on November 8, 2024, or the date such Reserve Banks inform the Secretary of the Board of such a request. (Secretary’s note: Subsequently, the Federal Reserve Banks of St. Louis and Kansas City were informed of the Board’s approval of their establishment of a primary credit rate of 4.75 percent, effective November 8, 2024.) Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee 15 It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Tuesday–Wednesday, December 17–18, 2024. The meeting adjourned at 10:20 a.m. on November 7, 2024. Notation Vote By notation vote completed on October 8, 2024, the Committee unanimously approved the minutes of the Committee meeting held on September 17–18, 2024. Attendance Jerome H.

{"date": "2024-12-18", "year": 2024, "source_type": "FOMC Minutes", "url": "https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20241218.pdf", "text": "FOMC FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee December 17–18, 2024 Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee December 17–18, 2024 A joint meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System was held in the offices of the Board of Governors on Tuesday, December 17, 2024, at 10:30 a.m. and continued on Wednesday, December 18, 2024, at 9:00 a.m.1 Developments in Financial Markets and Open Market Operations The manager turned first to a review of developments in financial markets. Nominal Treasury yields fluctuated over the intermeeting period and were slightly higher, on net, than in early November. Treasury yields had risen notably since their trough in mid-September, with the rise in the 10-year nominal yield driven largely by increases in real yields. Liquidity in Treasury markets deteriorated somewhat following the U.S. election but remained well within the ranges observed over the past three years. With near-term measures of inflation compensation a little higher over the intermeeting period and longer-term measures little changed, the manager noted that there were few signs of concern about persistent inflationary pressures in market prices. Equity prices largely sustained the gains that they had experienced in anticipation of, and immediately following, the U.S. election. The manager noted that market expectations for the path of the federal funds rate were little changed over the intermeeting period. Markets had almost fully priced in a 25 basis point cut in the target range for the federal funds rate at this meeting, and all respondents from the Open Market Desk’s Survey of Primary Dealers and Survey of Market Participants expected the same. Survey respondents anticipated that the pace of rate cuts would slow considerably in 2025, with the median respondent expecting 75 basis points of cuts for the full year; options and futures prices suggested a somewhat lower level of expected policy easing in 2025. However, in discussing both survey and market expectations, the manager noted that there was considerable uncertainty among market participants about the path of the federal funds rate in the year ahead. The manager also discussed balance sheet policy expectations. The average estimate of survey respondents for the timing of the end of balance sheet runoff shifted a bit later, to June 2025. This shift mainly reflected revisions to estimates by respondents who had expected balance sheet runoff to end in the last quarter of 2024 or in early 2025. 1 The Federal Open Market Committee is referenced as the “FOMC” and the “Committee” in these minutes; the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System is referenced as the “Board” in these minutes. 2 December 17–18, 2024 Regarding international developments, the manager noted that market participants expected central banks in nearly all advanced foreign economies (AFEs) to continue to reduce their policy rates in 2025. In contrast to the U.S., market expectations for policy rates at the end of 2025 in most AFEs had shifted lower over the intermeeting period. The manager noted that this widening between U.S. and foreign interest rates appeared to be a major contributor to the increase in the trade-weighted U.S. dollar index observed over the intermeeting period. The manager then turned to money markets and Desk operations. Unsecured overnight rates had remained stable over the intermeeting period, and with the exception of temporary pressures around month-end and Treasury auction settlement dates, rates on overnight repurchase agreements (repo) were little changed. The manager noted that, on average, market participants appeared to be expecting upward pressure in repo markets around year-end comparable with that seen at the September quarter-end. Based on term and forward-settling repo volumes, market participants appeared to have been more proactive than in recent years in preparing for the year-end, which the manager judged could help mitigate somewhat the extent of upward pressure on repo rates during that time. Pricing in the federal funds market continued to be insensitive to day-to-day changes in the supply of reserves over the intermeeting period. The manager noted that this outcome was consistent with reserves remaining abundant and that various other indicators, as well as responses about banks’ desired reserve levels from the Federal Reserve’s Senior Financial Officer Survey, pointed to the same conclusion. Looking ahead, the manager raised the possibility that the potential reinstatement of the debt limit in 2025 could result in substantial shifts in Federal Reserve liabilities that could pose challenges in assessing reserve conditions. Usage of the overnight reverse repurchase agreement (ON RRP) facility continued its decline over the intermeeting period. The recent decrease in ON RRP usage was attributable in part to increases in net Treasury bill issuance, which made Treasury bill rates more attractive. In the near term, the manager judged that ON RRP volumes were likely to rise because of an expected decline in net Treasury bill issuance and typical year-end dynamics. The manager also noted that the potential reinstatement of the debt limit could keep ON RRP balances elevated for some time in 2025. The manager discussed market expectations regarding a technical adjustment that would lower the ON RRP offering rate to the bottom of the target range for the federal funds rate. Based on the Desk surveys and market outreach, most market participants expected such an adjustment at this meeting. Market participants’ views varied on how much downward pressure this adjustment would put on money market rates, but repo rates were generally expected to fall more than the federal funds rate. Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee 3 The manager concluded by noting that the Desk was planning to add a second standing repo facility (SRF) auction on each day of the week spanning year-end. The manager viewed these additional auctions as technical exercises that could improve the Federal Reserve’s understanding of how SRF auction times can support effective policy implementation and market functioning during periods of expected money market pressures. By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk’s domestic transactions over the intermeeting period. There were no intervention operations in foreign currencies for the System’s account during the intermeeting period. Staff Review of the Economic Situation The information available at the time of the meeting indicated that real gross domestic product (GDP) had continued to expand at a solid pace in 2024. Labor market conditions had eased since early 2024, but the unemployment rate remained low. Consumer price inflation was below its year-earlier rate but was still somewhat elevated. Total consumer price inflation—as measured by the 12-month change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE)—was 2.3 percent in October, below the 3.0 percent rate seen a year earlier. Core PCE price inflation—which excludes changes in consumer energy prices and many consumer food prices—was 2.8 percent in October, lower than its 3.4 percent rate a year earlier. In November, the 12-month change in the consumer price index (CPI) was 2.7 percent, and core CPI inflation was 3.3 percent; both were below their year-earlier rates. Given both the CPI and producer price index data, the staff estimated that total PCE price inflation would be reported as 2.5 percent over the 12 months ending in November and that core PCE price inflation would be 2.8 percent. Recent data suggested that labor market conditions had eased slightly further but remained solid. Average monthly nonfarm payroll gains over October and November were a little below their pace in the third quarter. The staff estimated that job gains were held down by the effects of labor strikes and hurricanes in October and were boosted by a similar amount in November after those effects unwound. The unemployment rate ticked up to 4.2 percent in November, and both the labor force participation rate and the employment-to-population ratio moved down a bit further. The unemployment rates for African Americans and for Hispanics also moved up, and both rates were above those for Asians and for Whites. The ratio of job vacancies to unemployment held steady at 1.1 in November, slightly lower than its level just before the pandemic. Average hourly earnings for all employees rose 4 percent over the 12 months ending in November—the same rate as in the previous month. Real GDP posted a solid gain in the third quarter that was similar to its second-quarter pace. Real private domestic final purchases (PDFP)—which comprises PCE and private fixed investment and 4 December 17–18, 2024 which often provides a better signal than GDP of underlying economic momentum—rose faster than real GDP in the third quarter. Exports rose briskly in the third quarter; import growth was even faster. In the fourth quarter, available economic indicators suggested that real GDP growth remained solid, with growth of real PDFP still outpacing that of real GDP. Imports fell more than exports in October, with real imports of capital goods dropping back after brisk growth earlier in the year. Foreign economic growth picked up in the third quarter, notably in the euro area and in Mexico. Recent economic indicators, however, suggested much weaker momentum in foreign economies in the fourth quarter, with lackluster manufacturing activity and subdued private consumption spending. In China, growth in retail sales slowed, suggesting that domestic demand remained weak. Strength in high-tech goods production continued abroad, mainly in Asia excluding China, supported by buoyant U.S. demand. Inflation in foreign economies continued to ease. In most AFEs, headline inflation slowed to near or below target levels, mainly reflecting the pass-through of lower energy prices earlier in the year. Services inflation, however, remained high in some of those economies. In China, inflation remained close to zero, in part due to falling food prices. By contrast, in some Latin American countries, most notably Brazil, inflation continued to increase, partly because of currency depreciation. Staff Review of the Financial Situation The market-implied path of the federal funds rate over the next year edged higher, on net, since the U.S. election, as investors assessed the implications of incoming inflation data and potential economic policy changes for the near-term economic outlook. Communications by Federal Reserve officials contributed to investors’ perceptions of a slower timeline for policy rate reductions. Nominal Treasury yields across the maturity spectrum initially increased but then reversed those increases, ending the intermeeting period little changed. Measures of near-term inflation compensation moved up, while those of longer-term inflation compensation were little changed. Broad equity prices rose, with more pronounced increases in stock prices in cyclical sectors amid increased investor optimism for corporate profits, and high-yield bond spreads narrowed. The VIX—a forward-looking measure of near-term equity market volatility—fell notably and remained well below pre-election levels. Foreign financial market pricing reflected weaker-than-expected foreign data releases, expectations of further policy easing by foreign central banks, and potential changes in U.S. trade policy. Accordingly, foreign bond yields generally declined relative to their U.S. counterparts, contributing to dollar appreciation against most foreign currencies. Foreign equities generally underperformed U.S. equities, in part reflecting investors’ expectations of economic growth diverging further between the U.S. and the rest of the world. Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee 5 Many foreign central banks eased their policy rates during the intermeeting period, including the Bank of Canada, the European Central Bank, and the Swiss National Bank, among the AFEs, and the central banks of Hong Kong, India, Korea, and Mexico, among the emerging market economies. An exception was the Central Bank of Brazil, which increased its policy rate 100 basis points and signaled further hikes in the face of inflationary pressures. Conditions in U.S. short-term funding markets remained generally stable over the intermeeting period, with the lowering of the target range for the federal funds rate in November fully passing through to both secured and unsecured reference rates. Money market funds’ (MMFs) usage of the ON RRP facility was lower, on average, than in the previous intermeeting period, reflecting increased holdings of Treasury bills amid sizable net bill issuance. Overall, MMF assets under management stayed near record highs. Spreads of unsecured commercial paper maturing over year-end remained within typical ranges, and global offshore dollar funding markets continued to be stable. In domestic markets, borrowing costs for households, businesses, and municipalities remained elevated despite small declines in most credit segments. Rates on 30-year fixed-rate conforming residential mortgages declined but stayed elevated. Interest rates on credit cards and new auto loans continued to be at historical highs, although interest rates on new auto loans decreased further. Borrowing costs for leveraged loan borrowers declined slightly. Interest rates on newly originated commercial and industrial (C&I) loans ticked down in the third quarter, and interest rates on short- term loans to small businesses remained unchanged. Yields on an array of fixed-income securities, including investment- and speculative-grade corporate bonds and commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS), decreased slightly but remained elevated. Financing in capital markets continued to be broadly available for large-to-midsize businesses and municipalities. For small businesses, however, credit availability remained relatively tight, and loan originations stayed subdued in October. C&I loans by banks increased moderately in October and were flat through November after modest growth in the third quarter. After stalling in the third quarter, commercial real estate (CRE) loan growth picked up moderately in October and remained subdued through late November. Meanwhile, agency CMBS issuance continued to be weak in October, while non-agency CMBS issuance was strong in October and in the first three weeks of November, reflecting a high volume of refinancing activity. Credit continued to be generally available for most households. Even so, auto loans were little changed in the third quarter, and growth of revolving credit was weak into November. Credit in the residential mortgage market continued to be readily available for high-credit-score borrowers, while credit availability for low-credit-score borrowers improved, on net, over the six months through October. 6 December 17–18, 2024 Credit quality remained solid for large-to-midsize firms, municipalities, and most home mortgage borrowers. The credit performance of corporate bonds and leveraged loans was generally stable. At banks, delinquency rates on C&I loans were stable and remained within the range observed over the past decade. Delinquency rates on small business loans continued to increase through October, as did delinquencies on small business credit cards through September. In CRE markets, credit performance deteriorated further as aggregate CMBS delinquency rates rose through October, driven by delinquencies on office loans. At banks, delinquency rates on CRE loans ticked up through September from already elevated levels. Regarding household credit quality, delinquency rates on most residential mortgages were largely unchanged and stood near historical lows. However, the delinquency rate on Federal Housing Administration mortgages, which are disproportionately used by borrowers with lower credit scores and smaller down payments, remained above pre-pandemic levels. Delinquency rates on credit cards continued to increase, albeit at a slower pace than earlier in the year, while delinquency rates on auto loans were unchanged. Staff Economic Outlook The staff projection at the December meeting was for economic conditions to stay solid. Given the elevated uncertainty regarding specifics about the scope and timing of potential changes to trade, immigration, fiscal, and regulatory policies and their potential effects on the economy, the staff highlighted the difficulty of selecting and assessing the importance of such factors for the baseline projection and featured a number of alternative scenarios. After incorporating the recent data and preliminary placeholder assumptions about potential policy changes, real GDP growth was projected to be slightly slower than in the previous baseline forecast, and the unemployment rate was expected to be a bit higher but to remain near the staff’s estimate of its natural rate. In the staff’s baseline projection, the inflation forecast for 2024 was slightly higher than the one prepared for the previous meeting, reflecting upside surprises in some recent data. Inflation in 2025 was expected to remain at about the same rate as in 2024, as the effects of the staff’s placeholder trade policy assumptions held inflation up. Thereafter, inflation was forecast to decline to 2 percent by 2027, the same as in the projection at the November meeting. The staff continued to view the uncertainty around the baseline projection as within the range seen over the past 20 years, a period that encompassed a number of episodes during which uncertainty about the economy and federal policy changes was elevated. The staff judged that the risks around the baseline forecasts for employment and real GDP growth were balanced, as concerns about downside risks from a marked cooling in labor market conditions had eased in recent months. The risks around the inflation forecast were seen as tilted to the upside, as core inflation had not come Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee 7 down as much as expected in 2024 and the effects of trade policy changes could be larger than the staff had assumed. Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, participants submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation for each year from 2024 through 2027 and over the longer run. These projections were based on participants’ individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy, including their projections of the federal funds rate. The longer-run projections represented each participant’s assessment of the rate to which each variable would tend to converge under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy. The Summary of Economic Projections was released to the public after the meeting. In their discussion of inflation developments, participants noted that although inflation had eased substantially from its peak in 2022, it remained somewhat elevated. Participants commented that the overall pace of disinflation had slowed over 2024 and that some recent monthly price readings had been higher than anticipated. Nevertheless, most remarked that disinflationary progress continued to be apparent across a broad range of core goods and services prices. Notably, some participants observed that in the core goods and market-based core services categories, excluding housing, prices were increasing at rates close to those seen during earlier periods of price stability. Many participants noted that the slowing in these components of inflation corroborated reports received from their business contacts that firms were more reluctant to increase prices, as consumers appeared to be more price sensitive and were increasingly seeking discounts. With respect to core services prices, a majority of participants remarked that increases in some components had exceeded expectations over recent months; many noted, however, that the increases were concentrated largely in non-market- based price categories and that price movements in such categories typically have not provided reliable signals about resource pressures or the future trajectory of inflation. Most participants also remarked that increases in housing services prices remained somewhat elevated, though they continued to slow gradually, as the pace of rent increases for new tenants continued to moderate and would eventually be reflected further in housing services prices. With regard to the outlook for inflation, participants expected that inflation would continue to move toward 2 percent, although they noted that recent higher-than-expected readings on inflation, and the effects of potential changes in trade and immigration policy, suggested that the process could take longer than previously anticipated. Several observed that the disinflationary process may have stalled temporarily or noted the risk that it could. A couple of participants judged that positive sentiment in financial markets and momentum in economic activity could continue to put upward pressure on inflation. All participants judged that uncertainty about the scope, timing, and economic effects of 8 December 17–18, 2024 potential changes in policies affecting foreign trade and immigration was elevated. Reflecting that uncertainty, participants took varied approaches in accounting for these effects. A number of participants indicated that they incorporated placeholder assumptions to one degree or another into their projections. Other participants indicated that they did not incorporate such assumptions, and a few participants did not indicate whether they incorporated such assumptions. Several participants remarked that insofar as recent solid increases in real GDP reflected favorable supply developments, the strength of economic activity was unlikely to be a source of upward inflation pressures. Participants cited various factors as being likely to put continuing downward pressure on inflation, including waning business pricing power, the Committee’s still-restrictive monetary policy stance, and well-anchored longer-term inflation expectations. Some participants noted that nominal wage growth had continued to move down. Further, several observed that, with supply and demand in the labor market being roughly in balance and in light of recent productivity gains, labor market conditions were unlikely to be a source of inflationary pressure in the near future. However, several remarked that nominal wage growth remained slightly above the pace likely to be consistent over time with 2 percent inflation. In discussing labor market developments, participants viewed recent readings on a range of indicators as consistent with an ongoing gradual easing in labor market conditions even as the unemployment rate remained low. Participants cited declines in job vacancies, the quits rate, the rate at which the unemployed were obtaining jobs, and turnover as consistent with a gradual easing in labor demand. Participants generally noted, however, that there were no signs of rapid deterioration in labor market conditions, as layoffs remained low. Participants generally judged that current labor market conditions were broadly consistent with the Committee’s longer-run goal of maximum employment. With regard to the outlook for the labor market, participants anticipated that under appropriate monetary policy, conditions in the labor market would likely remain solid. Participants generally noted that labor market indicators merited close monitoring. Several participants observed that the evaluation of underlying trends in labor market developments had continued to be challenging and that assessments of the outlook for the labor market were associated with considerable uncertainty. Some participants noted that the labor market could soften further, as the recent pace of payroll growth had been below the rate that would likely keep the unemployment rate constant, given a stable labor force participation rate. Participants observed that economic activity had continued to expand at a solid pace and that recent data on economic activity and consumer spending in particular were, on balance, stronger than anticipated. Participants remarked that consumption had been supported by a solid labor market, rising real wages, and elevated household net worth. Several participants cautioned that low- and moderate-income households continued to experience financial strains, which could damp their Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee 9 spending. A couple of participants cited continued increases in rates of delinquencies on credit card borrowing and automobile loans as signs of such strains. With regard to the business sector, several participants noted that favorable aggregate supply developments—including increases in labor supply, business investment, and productivity—continued to support a solid expansion of business activity. A majority of participants remarked that the behavior of equity markets reflected positive sentiment on the part of investors. Many participants also remarked that District contacts generally reported greater optimism about the economic outlook, stemming in part from an expectation of an easing in government regulations and changes in tax policies. In contrast, some participants noted that contacts reported increased uncertainty regarding potential changes in federal government policies. A couple of participants remarked that the agricultural sector continued to face significant strains stemming from low crop prices and high input costs. In their evaluation of the risks and uncertainties associated with the economic outlook, the vast majority of participants judged the risks to the attainment of the Committee’s dual-mandate objectives of maximum employment and price stability to be roughly in balance. In particular, participants saw two-sided risks to achieving those goals. Almost all participants judged that upside risks to the inflation outlook had increased. As reasons for this judgment, participants cited recent stronger-than- expected readings on inflation and the likely effects of potential changes in trade and immigration policy. Other reasons mentioned included possible disruptions in global supply chains due to geopolitical developments, a larger-than-anticipated easing in financial conditions, stronger-than- expected household spending, and more persistent shelter price increases. A few participants remarked that, in the period ahead, it might be difficult to distinguish more persistent influences on inflation from potentially temporary ones, such as those stemming from changes in trade policy that could lead to shifts in the level of prices. Most participants noted that risks to the achievement of the Committee’s maximum-employment goal appeared to be roughly balanced, though some saw risks to the labor market as tilted to the downside. Participants pointed to various risks to economic activity and employment, including downside risks associated with weaker output growth abroad, increased financial vulnerabilities stemming from overvaluation of risky assets, or an unexpected weakening of the labor market, and upside risks associated with increased optimism and continued strength in domestic spending as upside factors. In their consideration of monetary policy at this meeting, participants generally noted that inflation had made progress toward the Committee’s objective but remained somewhat elevated. Participants also observed that recent indicators suggested that economic activity had continued to expand at a solid pace, labor market conditions had generally eased since earlier in the year, and the unemployment rate had moved up but remained low. The vast majority of participants viewed it as appropriate to 10 December 17–18, 2024 lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 4¼ to 4½ percent. They assessed that such a further lowering of the target range for the policy rate would help maintain the strength in the economy and the labor market while continuing to enable further progress on inflation. A majority of participants noted that their judgments about this meeting’s appropriate policy action had been finely balanced. Some participants stated that there was merit in keeping the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged. These participants suggested that the risk of persistently elevated inflation had increased in recent months, and several of these participants stressed the need for monetary policy to help foster financial conditions that would be consistent with inflation returning sustainably to 2 percent. Participants judged that it was appropriate to continue the process of reducing the Federal Reserve’s securities holdings. In discussing the outlook for monetary policy, participants indicated that the Committee was at or near the point at which it would be appropriate to slow the pace of policy easing. They also indicated that if the data came in about as expected, with inflation continuing to move down sustainably to 2 percent and the economy remaining near maximum employment, it would be appropriate to continue to move gradually toward a more neutral stance of policy over time. Some participants observed that, with the target range for the federal funds rate having been lowered a total of 100 basis points with this meeting’s decision, the policy rate was now significantly closer to its neutral value than when the Committee commenced policy easing in September. In addition, many participants suggested that a variety of factors underlined the need for a careful approach to monetary policy decisions over coming quarters. These factors included recent elevated inflation readings, the continuing strength of spending, reduced downside risks to the outlook for the labor market and economic activity, and increased upside risks to the outlook for inflation. A substantial majority of participants observed that, at the current juncture, with its policy stance still meaningfully restrictive, the Committee was well positioned to take time to assess the evolving outlook for economic activity and inflation, including the economy’s responses to the Committee’s earlier policy actions. Participants noted that monetary policy decisions were not on a preset course and were conditional on the evolution of the economy, the economic outlook, and the balance of risks. In discussing risk-management considerations that could bear on the outlook for monetary policy, the vast majority of participants agreed that risks to achieving the Committee’s employment and inflation goals remained roughly in balance. Many participants observed that the current high degree of uncertainty made it appropriate for the Committee to take a gradual approach as it moved toward a neutral policy stance. Participants noted that although inflation was on course to return sustainably to 2 percent over the next few years and the Committee was determined to restore and maintain price stability, the likelihood that elevated inflation could be more persistent had increased. Most participants remarked that, with the stance of monetary policy now significantly less restrictive, the Committee could take a careful approach in considering adjustments to the stance of monetary policy. Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee 11 Many participants noted that the Committee could hold the policy rate at a restrictive level, or ease policy more slowly, if inflation remained elevated, and several remarked that policy easing could take place more rapidly if labor market conditions deteriorated, economic activity faltered, or inflation returned to 2 percent more quickly than anticipated. Committee Policy Actions In their discussions of monetary policy for this meeting, members agreed that recent indicators suggested that economic activity had continued to expand at a solid pace. Labor market conditions had generally eased since earlier in the year, and the unemployment rate had moved up but remained low. Members concurred that inflation had made progress toward the Committee’s 2 percent objective but remained somewhat elevated. Almost all members agreed that the risks to achieving the Committee’s employment and inflation goals were roughly in balance. Members viewed the economic outlook as uncertain and agreed that they were attentive to the risks to both sides of the Committee’s dual mandate. In support of its goals, the Committee agreed to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 4¼ to 4½ percent. One member voted against that decision, preferring to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 4½ to 4¾ percent. In light of their judgment that, after this meeting, the Committee would likely slow the pace of further adjustments to the stance of monetary policy, members agreed to indicate that, in considering the extent and timing of additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee would carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. Members agreed to continue to reduce the Federal Reserve’s holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities. Members also judged that it was appropriate to make a technical adjustment to the rate offered at the ON RRP facility by setting it equal to the bottom of the target range for the federal funds rate, thereby bringing the rate back into an alignment that had existed when the facility was established as a monetary policy tool. All members agreed that the postmeeting statement should affirm their strong commitment both to supporting maximum employment and to returning inflation to the Committee’s 2 percent objective. Members agreed that, in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee would continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. They would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerged that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals. Members also agreed that their assessments would take into account a wide range of information, including readings on labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments. 12 December 17–18, 2024 At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Open Market Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive, for release at 2:00 p.m.: “Effective December 19, 2024, the Federal Open Market Committee directs the Desk to: • Undertake open market operations as necessary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of 4¼ to 4½ percent. • Conduct standing overnight repurchase agreement operations with a minimum bid rate of 4.5 percent and with an aggregate operation limit of $500 billion. • Conduct standing overnight reverse repurchase agreement operations at an offering rate of 4.25 percent and with a per-counterparty limit of $160 billion per day. Setting this rate at the bottom of the target range for the federal funds rate is intended to support effective monetary policy implementation and the smooth functioning of short-term funding markets. • Roll over at auction the amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of Treasury securities maturing in each calendar month that exceeds a cap of $25 billion per month. Redeem Treasury coupon securities up to this monthly cap and Treasury bills to the extent that coupon principal payments are less than the monthly cap. • Reinvest the amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) received in each calendar month that exceeds a cap of $35 billion per month into Treasury securities to roughly match the maturity composition of Treasury securities outstanding. • Allow modest deviations from stated amounts for reinvestments, if needed for operational reasons. • Engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal Reserve’s agency MBS transactions.” The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below for release at 2:00 p.m.: “Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace. Since earlier in the year, labor market conditions have generally eased, and the unemployment rate has moved up but remains low. Inflation has made progress toward the Committee’s 2 percent objective but remains somewhat elevated. The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. The Committee judges that the risks to achieving its employment and Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee 13 inflation goals are roughly in balance. The economic outlook is uncertain, and the Committee is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate. In support of its goals, the Committee decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by ¼ percentage point to 4¼ to 4½ percent. In considering the extent and timing of additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. The Committee will continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities. The Committee is strongly committed to supporting maximum employment and returning inflation to its 2 percent objective. In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals. The Committee’s assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.” Voting for this action: Jerome H. Powell, John C. Williams, Thomas I. Barkin, Michael S. Barr, Raphael W. Bostic, Michelle W. Bowman, Lisa D. Cook, Mary C. Daly, Philip N. Jefferson, Adriana D. Kugler, and Christopher J. Waller. Voting against this action: Beth M. Hammack. President Hammack dissented because she preferred to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 4½ to 4¾ percent, in light of uneven progress in returning inflation to 2 percent, the strength of the economy and the labor market, and the state of financial conditions. In her view, with the current federal funds rate not far from neutral, holding the funds rate at a modestly restrictive stance for a time was appropriate to ensure that inflation returns to 2 percent in a timely fashion. Consistent with the Committee's decision to lower the target range for the federal funds rate to 4¼ to 4½ percent, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted unanimously to lower the interest rate paid on reserve balances to 4.4 percent, effective December 19, 2024. The Board of 14 December 17–18, 2024 Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted unanimously to approve a ¼ percentage point decrease in the primary credit rate to 4.5 percent, effective December 19, 2024.2 It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Tuesday–Wednesday, January 28–29, 2025. The meeting adjourned at 10:10 a.m. on December 18, 2024. Notation Vote By notation vote completed on November 25, 2024, the Committee unanimously approved the minutes of the Committee meeting held on November 6–7, 2024. Attendance Jerome H.

The vote also encompassed approval by the Board of Governors of the establishment of a 4.5 percent primary credit rate by the remaining Federal Reserve Banks, effective on December 19, 2024, or the date such Reserve Banks inform the Secretary of the Board of such a request. (Secretary’s note: Subsequently, the Federal Reserve Banks of St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas were informed of the Board’s approval of their establishment of a primary credit rate of 4.5 percent, effective December 19, 2024.)

Hirtle Anna Paulson Andrea Raffo Chiara Scotti4 William Wascher Associate Economists By unanimous vote, the Committee selected the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to execute transactions for the System Open Market Account (SOMA). By unanimous vote, the Committee selected Patricia Zo- bel to serve at the pleasure of the Committee as deputy manager of the SOMA through February 20, 2023, and Roberto Perli and Julie Ann Remache to serve at the pleasure of the Committee as manager and deputy man- ager of the SOMA, respectively, effective February 21, 2023, on the understanding that these selections were subject to being satisfactory to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Secretary’s note: The Federal Reserve Bank of New York subsequently sent advice that the se- lections indicated previously were satisfactory. 4 Chiara Scotti’s selection was set to be effective upon her em- ployment with the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Minutes of the Meeting of January 31–February 1, 2023 Page 3 As part of the annual review of the Committee’s govern- ance documents for open market operations and foreign currency transactions, the Committee unanimously ap- proved a new governance document titled “FOMC Au- thorizations and Continuing Directives for Open Market Operations.”3 The new document includes (1) authori- zations previously in the Committee’s Authorization for Foreign Currency Operations and Authorization for Domestic Open Market Operations; (2) a new “Contin- uing Directive for Domestic Open Market Operations,” which combines direction to the Desk in the Standing Repurchase Agreement Facility and FIMA Repurchase Agreement Facility resolutions with direction to the Desk to continue to carry out other ongoing activities; (3) the Foreign Currency Directive; and (4) two other existing documents related to contingency arrange- ments. The new unified document improves clarity and transparency in the governance of Desk activities but does not make substantive changes to governance. The domestic policy directive released after each FOMC meeting will have modest conforming changes going forward. Ahead of the vote on policies relating to information se- curity, external communications, and investment and trading, the Chair commented on the critical importance of maintaining the public’s trust and confidence in the Federal Reserve as an institution and indicated that these policies were very important in that regard. All partici- pants indicated support for, and agreed to abide by the requirements of, the Program for Security of FOMC In- formation (Program), the FOMC Policy on External Communications of Committee Participants, the FOMC Policy on External Communications of Federal Reserve System Staff, and the Investment and Trading Policy for FOMC Officials. The Committee voted unanimously to reaffirm all four policies without revision.3 As part of the Committee’s annual organizational review process, all participants indicated support for the State- ment on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strat- egy, and the Committee voted unanimously to reaffirm it without revision.3 Developments in Financial Markets and Open Market Operations The manager pro tem turned first to a review of U.S. financial market developments. Market participants generally expected U.S. economic growth to moderate this year, although there was a wide dispersion in views about the extent of a potential slowdown. Market par- ticipants interpreted incoming data as pointing to mod- erating inflation risks. Against this backdrop, market participants judged that the FOMC would likely slow the pace of rate increases further at the current meeting, and respondents to the Desk’s Survey of Primary Dealers and Survey of Market Participants widely expected the Committee to implement a ¼ percentage point increase in the target range for the federal funds rate. Survey re- spondents assessed that uncertainty around the likely peak level of the policy rate narrowed relative to the comparable results from the December surveys and, on average, placed significant probability on a target federal funds rate range close to 5 percent. A significant share of survey respondents anticipated that the Committee would hold the policy rate stable for much of 2023. Moderating inflation in the United States and improving global growth prospects lifted market sentiment. While most Desk survey respondents expected subdued growth or a mild recession in 2023, market participants continued to see notable uncertainties ahead, including prospects for a deeper downturn or the potential for more persistent inflation. Regarding the international outlook, signs of a faster re- opening in China and a less severe downturn in Europe eased concerns about global growth, contributing to a depreciation in the exchange value of the dollar and sup- porting optimism about emerging market economies. Narrowing interest rate differentials between the United States and other advanced foreign economies also con- tributed to dollar depreciation, as some foreign central bank communications suggested a need for further mon- etary policy tightening to address inflation pressures. In addition, the Bank of Japan unexpectedly widened its yield curve control band at its December meeting to ad- dress market functioning issues in the market for Japa- nese government bonds. Over the period, some other central banks communicated that they were at or near a point where it would be appropriate to pause policy rate increases and assess the effects of cumulative policy tightening. The manager pro tem turned next to a discussion of money markets and Federal Reserve operations. Money market rates were stable over the period, with the year- end passing smoothly. As expected, balances in the overnight reverse repurchase agreement (ON RRP) fa- cility increased at year-end but quickly retraced. Market participants generally expected usage of the ON RRP fa- cility to continue a downward trend in 2023, moderating the decline in reserve balances as the Federal Reserve’s holdings of securities continue to run off. Should tran- sitory pressures occur in money markets over the course of the year, the manager pro tem noted that the standing Page 4 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ repurchase agreement (repo) facility and discount win- dow would be available to help support effective mone- tary policy implementation. The manager noted that, over coming months, develop- ments affecting the Treasury General Account (TGA) and Treasury financing could influence money market conditions. An increase in TGA balances associated with April individual tax receipts could result in a tem- porary decline in reserve balances. In subsequent months, uncertainties associated with the debt limit could also be important. In particular, the Treasury could increase bill issuance to rebuild TGA balances once the debt limit is lifted, reducing reserves and po- tentially lifting money market rates. The manager pro tem noted that in recent months, investors in the ON RRP facility had responded to small increases in money market rates by shifting balances into private in- vestments, and that reductions in ON RRP volumes may help smooth adjustments in money markets. By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk’s domestic transactions over the intermeeting period. There were no intervention operations in foreign currencies for the System’s account during the intermeeting period. Staff Review of the Economic Situation The information available at the time of the January 31– February 1 meeting indicated that labor market condi- tions remained tight in December, with the unemploy- ment rate at a historical low. Consumer price inflation— as measured by the 12-month percent change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE)—continued to step down in November and De- cember but was still elevated. Real gross domestic prod- uct (GDP) increased at a solid pace in the fourth quarter of last year. Total nonfarm payroll employment increased solidly in December, although at a slower pace than in the previ- ous two months. The unemployment rate moved back down to 3.5 percent in December. The unemployment rate for African Americans was unchanged, and the un- employment rate for Hispanics ticked up; the unemploy- ment rates for both groups remained above the aggre- gate measure. The aggregate measures of both the labor force participation rate and the employment-to-popula- tion ratio edged up. The private-sector job openings rate, as measured by the Job Openings and Labor Turn- over Survey, was flat in November and remained high. Measures of nominal wage growth slowed at the end of last year but continued to be elevated. The three-month change in the employment cost index (ECI) of hourly compensation in the private sector slowed to a 4.0 per- cent annual rate in December, while the three-month change measure of average hourly earnings (AHE) for all employees eased to an annual rate of 4.1 percent. Over the 12 months ending in December, the ECI in- creased 5.1 percent, and AHE rose 4.6 percent. Consumer price inflation eased in November and De- cember but remained elevated. Total PCE price infla- tion was 5.0 percent over the 12 months ending in De- cember, 1.1 percentage points lower than the October figure. Core PCE price inflation, which excludes changes in consumer energy prices and many consumer food prices, was 4.4 percent over the 12 months ending in December, down 0.7 percentage point from its Octo- ber reading. The trimmed mean measure of 12-month PCE price inflation constructed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas was 4.4 percent in December, 0.3 per- centage point lower than in October. The latest survey- based readings on longer-term inflation expectations from the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s Survey of Consumer Expectations remained within the range of their values reported in recent months, while near-term measures of inflation expectations from these surveys moved down along with actual inflation. Although real GDP expanded at an annual rate of 2.9 percent in the fourth quarter, real private domestic final purchases (PDFP)—which includes PCE, residen- tial investment, and business fixed investment—in- creased at a subdued annual rate of 0.2 percent. Real GDP growth was bolstered especially by a large gain in inventory investment and a notable contribution from net exports, as imports fell more than exports. Both in- ventories and net exports are volatile categories in aggre- gate spending. Regarding production, U.S. manufactur- ing output declined sizably in both November and De- cember. Foreign economic growth slowed in the fourth quarter, weighed down by the COVID-19-related slowdown in China and repercussions of Russia’s war against Ukraine. Weaker global demand and a rebalancing from goods to services also resulted in a pronounced slowdown in manufacturing, which weighed on activity in emerging Asia. In China, the pivot away from its zero-COVID policy appears to have resulted in a rapid surge in virus cases late in the year, but also in a rebound in activity as restrictions were rapidly removed. In Europe, the slow- down in economic growth was tempered by mild winter weather, which also prompted further declines in energy _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Minutes of the Meeting of January 31–February 1, 2023 Page 5 prices. A decline in retail energy as well as food prices contributed to an easing in headline consumer price in- flation in many foreign economies. With core inflation remaining elevated amid tight labor markets, however, many central banks continued to tighten monetary pol- icy. Staff Review of the Financial Situation Over the intermeeting period, the market-implied fed- eral funds rate path was little changed for 2023 but mod- erately moved down further out. Nominal Treasury yields were little changed, while swaps-based inflation compensation measures fell notably. Stock market in- dexes were slightly higher, and market volatility declined but remained slightly elevated. Businesses and house- holds continued to face elevated borrowing costs. Credit quality remained strong overall, although there were some signs of deterioration for consumer loans. The market-implied federal funds rate path for 2023 was little changed, on net, during the intermeeting period but fell moderately beyond mid-2024. On net, nominal Treasury yields were roughly unchanged, and swaps- market-implied inflation compensation measures fell notably. Broad stock price indexes ended the intermeeting period only slightly higher despite sizable fluctuations. Equity prices fell sharply following the December FOMC state- ment but recovered over the remainder of the period in response to data releases. The VIX—the one-month option-implied volatility on the S&P 500—decreased somewhat but remained slightly above the median range of its historical distribution. Spreads on investment- grade and high-yield corporate bonds narrowed some- what, on net, over the intermeeting period, while spreads on municipal bonds narrowed substantially. Conditions in short-term funding markets remained sta- ble over the intermeeting period, with the December in- crease in the target range for the federal funds rate and the associated increases in the Federal Reserve’s admin- istered rates passing through quickly to overnight money market rates. In secured markets, repo rates were roughly the same as the ON RRP offering rate but con- tinued to occasionally print slightly higher around days with Treasury bill and coupon settlements. Daily take- up in the ON RRP facility remained elevated, reflecting continued elevated assets under management (AUM) for money market mutual funds (MMFs), ongoing uncer- tainty around the policy path, and limited supply of al- ternative investments such as Treasury bills. Net yields on MMFs rose further over the intermeeting period, mostly passing through the increase in administered rates. Bank deposit rates gradually increased but contin- ued to lag cumulative increases in the federal funds rate. Over the intermeeting period, investor perceptions of an improved economic outlook in China and Europe con- tributed to increases in foreign risky asset prices and weighed on the exchange value of the dollar. Global eq- uity indexes rose, supported in part by lower European natural gas prices and China’s decision to abandon its zero-COVID policy. Sovereign yields increased notably in the euro area and Japan, reflecting more-restrictive- than-expected communications from the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan’s decision to widen its yield curve control target band, respectively. In con- trast, yields in other major advanced foreign economies were little changed on net. The staff’s broad dollar index declined over the intermeeting period, with larger de- clines against emerging market economy (EME) curren- cies amid significant inflows into EME-focused invest- ment funds in January on improved investor sentiment. Narrowing yield differentials between the United States and some advanced foreign economies also contributed to the depreciation of the dollar. In domestic credit markets, businesses and households continued to face elevated borrowing costs. Yields for corporate bonds declined, while borrowing costs for lev- eraged loans were little changed at elevated levels. Bank interest rates for commercial and industrial (C&I) loans continued to trend upward in the fourth quarter. Yields on municipal bonds declined during the intermeeting pe- riod but remained above their historical average. Resi- dential mortgage rates were little changed over the inter- meeting period and remained well above their levels in the previous tightening cycle, notwithstanding the de- cline from their peak in early November. Interest rates on existing credit cards continued to increase in recent months, and interest rates on new auto loans also rose through mid-January. Credit remained broadly available for businesses and households with strong credit quality but remained tight for lower-rated borrowers. Lending standards tightened further for bank-dependent borrowers. Issuance of cor- porate bonds was subdued in December before picking up somewhat in January. New launches of leveraged loans were notably subdued in December and January, likely reflecting soft investor demand and higher refer- ence rates on floating-rate loans. In the January Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices (SLOOS), banks reported hav- ing tightened C&I and commercial real estate (CRE) Page 6 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ lending standards over the previous three months. Al- though C&I loans at banks continued to expand through December, they decelerated relative to earlier in the year, in line with tighter lending standards and weaker demand for C&I loans over the fourth quarter. CRE loan growth on domestic banks’ balance sheets remained robust in the fourth quarter. Meanwhile, issuance of commercial mortgage-backed securities remained slow in November and December, amid high base interest rates and spreads. Some tightening in lending conditions was also evident for small businesses, with the share of small firms reporting that it was more difficult to obtain credit compared with three months earlier continuing to trend up through December. Credit was broadly available in the residential mortgage market for high-credit-score borrowers who met stand- ard conforming loan criteria. Credit availability for households with lower credit scores was considerably tighter, though comparable to levels prevailing before the pandemic. Purchase mortgage applications and re- finance applications were both little changed over the in- termeeting period. Home equity line of credit (HELOC) balances at banks continued to grow through the fourth quarter, on net, potentially reflecting homeowners using HELOCs as a preferred way of extracting home equity in the presence of high current mortgage rates. In the January SLOOS, banks reported tighter standards for all consumer loans. Even so, total credit card balances in- creased at a solid pace in November, while auto loans grew modestly. Overall, credit quality remained strong, although there was some deterioration for credit card and auto loan borrowers and some predictors of future credit quality worsened a bit further. The volume of corporate bond rating downgrades outpaced upgrades in December, al- though the level of downgrades remained moderate. Leveraged loans experienced notable net rating down- grades in December, but the pace moderated in January. Default rates on corporate bonds and leveraged loans remained low. Measures of expected default probabili- ties for corporate bonds and leveraged loans remained elevated relative to their historical distributions. The credit quality of businesses that borrow from banks re- mained sound, on balance, although, in the January SLOOS, banks reported expecting a deterioration in the quality of business loans in their portfolio over 2023. Delinquencies on small business loans continued to edge up in November but remained low relative to historical levels. The credit quality of households also remained strong, on balance, despite some signs of deterioration. Delin- quencies for Federal Housing Administration mortgages increased slightly, but overall mortgage delinquency rates were still near pre-pandemic lows. Delinquency rates for credit cards and auto loans continued to rise during the third quarter. While delinquency rates on credit cards were still relatively low, those on auto loans rose above pre-pandemic levels. In the January SLOOS, banks reported expecting a further deterioration in the quality of household loans in 2023, especially for con- sumer loans. The staff provided an update on its assessment of the stability of the financial system and, on balance, charac- terized the financial vulnerabilities of the U.S. financial system as moderate. The staff judged that asset valua- tion pressures remained notable. In particular, the staff noted that measures of valuations in both residential and commercial property markets remained high, and that the potential for large declines in property prices re- mained greater than usual. In addition, the forward price-to-earnings ratio for S&P 500 firms remained above its median value despite the decline in equity prices over the past year. The staff assessed that valua- tion pressures had eased for corporate bonds and lever- aged loans, as spreads in both markets had increased from recent lows. The staff assessed that vulnerabilities associated with household and business leverage remained moderate, noting that although measures of business leverage were at or near a historically high level, the ability of firms to service their debt has kept pace with rising debt loads and interest rates. Household borrowing rose for bor- rowers with prime credit scores but declined for house- holds with lower credit scores. Vulnerabilities associated with financial leverage also remained moderate. In par- ticular, risk-based capital ratios for banks increased slightly, a staff measure of leverage at life insurance com- panies remained relatively flat in recent quarters, and lev- erage among private credit funds has remained steady for several years. While measures of hedge fund leverage have decreased since the pandemic shock, the staff noted that leverage among the largest funds was on track to return to 2019 levels. Vulnerabilities associated with funding risks were char- acterized as moderate. The rising rate environment has prompted inflows into prime retail MMFs, while AUM at prime institutional funds, which have proved more sensitive to turmoil in the past, have grown much less. Assets in open-end mutual funds that invest in less liquid _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Minutes of the Meeting of January 31–February 1, 2023 Page 7 instruments like bank loans or high-yield corporate bonds have declined notably over the past year. In re- sponse to vulnerabilities at MMFs and open-end mutual funds, the Securities and Exchange Commission has proposed rules to make these funds more resilient. Staff Economic Outlook The forecast for the U.S. economy prepared by the staff for this FOMC meeting had a somewhat higher path for the level of real GDP and a modestly lower path for the unemployment rate than in the December projection, re- flecting both the recent data and a small additional boost to output from a lower projected path for the dollar. Al- though recent data indicated that real GDP growth in the fourth quarter of 2022 was stronger than expected, real PDFP growth was weaker than previously forecast, and the large, unexpected boost to GDP growth from inventory investment was not projected to persist. In part reflecting the lagged effects of previous monetary policy tightening, the staff still projected real GDP growth to slow markedly this year and the labor market to soften. The staff forecast continued to include a pickup in real GDP growth starting next year, although projected output growth in 2024 and 2025 remains be- low the staff’s estimate of potential output growth. The level of real output was expected to move down to the staff’s estimate of potential near the end of 2025. Like- wise, the unemployment rate was projected to gradually move up to the staff’s estimate of its natural rate at the end of 2025. On a four-quarter change basis, total PCE price inflation was forecast to be 2.8 percent in 2023, and core inflation was expected to be 3.2 percent, both lower than in the December projection. With the effects of supply–de- mand imbalances in goods markets expected to further unwind and labor and product markets projected to be- come less tight, the staff continued to forecast that infla- tion would decline further over 2024 and 2025. On a four-quarter change basis, core goods inflation was pro- jected to move down further this year and then remain subdued, housing services inflation was expected to peak later this year and then move down, and core nonhous- ing services inflation was forecast to slow as nominal wage growth eased. With steep declines in consumer energy prices and a substantial moderation in food price inflation expected for this year, total inflation was pro- jected to step down markedly this year and then to track core inflation over the following two years. In 2025, both total and core PCE price inflation were expected to be near 2 percent. The sluggish growth in real private domestic spending expected this year and the persistently tight financial conditions were seen as tilting the risks to the downside around the baseline projection for real economic activ- ity, and the staff still viewed the possibility of a recession sometime this year as a plausible alternative to the base- line. Moreover, with core PCE price inflation having slowed in recent months, along with the cumulative up- ward revisions to the core inflation projection over the past year and the expected softening in economic growth, the staff now viewed the risks around the base- line forecast for inflation this year as balanced. For be- yond this year, the staff continued to view the risks around the inflation projection as skewed to the upside, reflecting concerns about the potential persistence of in- flation. Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook In their discussion of current economic conditions, par- ticipants noted that recent indicators pointed to modest growth in spending and production. Nonetheless, job gains had been robust in recent months, and the unem- ployment rate remained low. Inflation had eased some- what but remained elevated. Participants recognized that Russia’s war against Ukraine was causing tremen- dous human and economic hardship and was contrib- uting to elevated global uncertainty. Against this back- ground, participants continued to be highly attentive to inflation risks. Participants agreed that cumulative policy firming to date had reduced demand in the most interest-rate-sen- sitive sectors of the economy, particularly housing. Par- ticipants observed that growth in economic activity in 2022 had been below its longer-run trend and expected that real GDP growth would slow further in 2023. While real GDP growth had rebounded in the second half of 2022, several participants noted that growth in PDFP had nearly stalled in the fourth quarter. With inflation remaining unacceptably high, participants expected that a period of below-trend growth in real GDP would be needed to bring aggregate demand into better balance with aggregate supply and thereby reduce inflationary pressures. Some participants judged that recent eco- nomic data signaled a somewhat higher chance of con- tinued subdued economic growth, with inflation falling over time to the Committee’s longer-run goal of 2 per- cent, although some participants noted that the proba- bility of the economy entering a recession in 2023 re- mained elevated. Page 8 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ In their discussion of the household sector, participants observed that real consumer spending had declined in November and December—in part reflecting the tight- ening in financial conditions over the past year—and an- ticipated that consumption would likely grow at a sub- dued rate in 2023. Participants noted that excess savings accumulated during the pandemic had continued to sup- port consumption, although several participants re- marked that the importance of this factor would likely wane over time as excess savings continued to be drawn down or eroded by inflation. A couple of participants observed that some consumers were shifting their spending to less expensive alternatives. A few partici- pants noted the effects of higher interest costs in re- straining consumption or inhibiting the ability of some households to repay their loans, while a couple of par- ticipants noted that inflation was eroding households’ purchasing power. However, a couple of participants noted that some states could return part of their sizable budget surpluses to households through tax cuts or re- bates, which would provide support to consumption. Participants agreed that activity in the housing market had continued to weaken, largely reflecting the increase in mortgage rates over the past year. Regarding the business sector, participants observed that growth in business fixed investment spending had been subdued in the fourth quarter and was being restrained by past interest rate increases. A number of participants commented that supply bottlenecks continued to ease, although supply chain issues remained a challenge in some sectors. Several participants remarked that the re- cent strong growth in inventory investment will likely slow; a couple of those participants noted that busi- nesses appeared more confident that significant supply bottlenecks would not reemerge and might therefore choose to hold smaller inventories. Some participants commented that the easing of COVID-related lockdown restrictions in China or stronger-than-expected growth in economic activity in the euro area could provide sup- port to final demand in the United States. Participants agreed that the labor market remained very tight and assessed that labor demand substantially ex- ceeded the supply of available workers. Participants noted that the unemployment rate had returned to a his- torically low level in December, job vacancies remained high, and wage growth remained elevated. Several par- ticipants noted that recent reductions in the workforces of some large technology businesses followed much larger increases over the previous few years and judged that these reductions did not appear to reflect wide- spread weakness in the demand for labor. A few partic- ipants remarked that some business contacts appeared keen to retain workers even in the face of slowing de- mand for output because of their recent experiences of labor shortages and hiring challenges. Participants agreed that labor supply remained constrained by struc- tural factors such as the effects from the pandemic, in- cluding those on early retirements, and the reduced avail- ability and increased cost of childcare. Nevertheless, participants noted tentative signs that imbalances be- tween demand and supply in the labor market were im- proving, with job vacancies and payroll gains declining somewhat from high levels, the average number of hours worked falling, and growth in wages and employ- ment costs slowing. Some participants commented on the recent reduction in temporary employment, which previously had often preceded more widespread reduc- tions in labor demand. Under appropriate monetary policy, participants expected labor market demand and supply to come into better balance over time, easing up- ward pressure on nominal wages and prices. A number of participants commented on the importance of recog- nizing that, to the extent national unemployment in- creases, historical evidence indicates that even larger in- creases in the unemployment rate for some demographic groups—particularly African Americans and Hispan- ics—would be likely to occur. With inflation still well above the Committee’s longer- run goal of 2 percent, participants agreed that inflation was unacceptably high. A number of participants com- mented that the costs of elevated inflation are particu- larly high for lower-income households. Participants noted that inflation data received over the past three months showed a welcome reduction in the monthly pace of price increases but stressed that substantially more evidence of progress across a broader range of prices would be required to be confident that inflation was on a sustained downward path. Participants noted that core goods prices had declined notably over the pre- vious few months as supply bottlenecks had eased but anticipated that price declines for this component would dissipate as the downward pressure on goods prices from resolving supply bottlenecks fades. Participants judged that housing services inflation would likely begin to fall later this year, reflecting continued smaller in- creases, or potentially declines, in rents on new leases. Participants agreed that they had observed less evidence of a slowdown in the rate of increase of prices for core services excluding housing, a category that accounts for more than half of the core PCE price index. Participants judged that as long as the labor market remained very _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Minutes of the Meeting of January 31–February 1, 2023 Page 9 tight, wage growth in excess of 2 percent inflation and trend productivity growth would likely continue to put upward pressure on some prices in this component. A couple of participants observed that changes in wages tend to lag changes in prices, which can complicate the assessment of inflation pressures. A couple of partici- pants remarked that the poor performance of labor productivity growth last year was restraining aggregate supply, which was contributing to imbalances between aggregate demand and aggregate supply and therefore to upward pressure on inflation. Several participants noted the possibility that as consumers become more price sensitive, businesses might accept lower profit margins in an effort to maintain market share, which could re- duce inflation temporarily. Participants observed that indicators of short-term inflation expectations from sur- veys of households and businesses as well as from finan- cial markets had come down and that longer-term infla- tion expectations remained well anchored. A number of participants noted the importance of longer-term infla- tion expectations remaining anchored and remarked that the longer inflation remained elevated, the greater the risk of inflation expectations becoming unanchored. In that adverse scenario, it would be more costly to bring inflation down to achieve the Committee’s statutory ob- jectives of maximum employment and price stability. Participants observed that financial conditions remained much tighter than in early 2022. However, several par- ticipants observed that some measures of financial con- ditions had eased over the past few months. A few par- ticipants noted that increased confidence among market participants that inflation would fall quickly appeared to contribute to declines in market expectations of the fed- eral funds rate path beyond the near term. Participants noted that it was important that overall financial condi- tions be consistent with the degree of policy restraint that the Committee is putting into place in order to bring inflation back to the 2 percent goal. Participants observed that the uncertainty associated with their outlooks for economic activity, the labor mar- ket, and inflation was high. Regarding upside risks to inflation, participants cited a variety of factors, including the possibility that price pressures could prove to be more persistent than anticipated due to, for example, the labor market staying tight for longer than anticipated. Participants also saw a number of upside risks surround- ing the outlook for inflation stemming from factors abroad, such as China’s relaxation of its zero-COVID policies and Russia’s continuing war against Ukraine. However, a few participants remarked that the risks to their inflation outlook had become more balanced. Par- ticipants agreed that the risks to the outlook for eco- nomic activity were weighted to the downside. Partici- pants noted that sources of such risks included the pro- spect of unexpected negative shocks tipping the econ- omy into a recession in an environment of subdued growth, the effects of synchronous policy firming by ma- jor central banks, and disruptions in the financial system and broader economy associated with concerns that the statutory debt limit might not be raised in a timely man- ner. In their discussion of issues related to financial stability, several participants discussed vulnerabilities in the finan- cial system associated with higher interest rates, includ- ing the elevated valuations for some categories of assets, particularly in the CRE sector; the susceptibility of some nonbank financial institutions to runs; and the effect of large, unrealized losses on some banks’ securities port- folios. A few participants commented that international stresses had the potential to transmit to the U.S. financial system. A number of participants noted the importance of orderly functioning of the market for U.S. Treasury securities and stressed the importance of the appropriate authorities continuing to address issues related to the re- silience of the market. Although several participants noted that the Federal Reserve’s standing liquidity facil- ities could be helpful in addressing significant pressures in funding markets, should they arise, several partici- pants also noted the challenges of addressing potential disruptions in U.S. core market functioning. A few par- ticipants remarked that recent failures of companies in- volved in crypto finance have had a limited effect on the broader financial system. These participants indicated that this limited effect reflected the minimal extent of the crypto market’s connections to the banking system thus far, consistent with the risks associated with many of these activities. Several participants discussed the value of the Federal Reserve taking additional steps to understand the potential risks associated with climate change or to assess the materiality of such risks in the context of carrying out its responsibilities to evaluate risks in the banking system and broader financial system. A number of participants stressed that a drawn-out pe- riod of negotiations to raise the federal debt limit could pose significant risks to the financial system and the broader economy. In their consideration of appropriate monetary policy ac- tions at this meeting, participants concurred that the Committee had made significant progress over the past year in moving toward a sufficiently restrictive stance of monetary policy. Even so, participants agreed that, Page 10 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ while there were recent signs that the cumulative effect of the Committee’s tightening of the stance of monetary policy had begun to moderate inflationary pressures, in- flation remained well above the Committee’s longer-run goal of 2 percent and the labor market remained very tight, contributing to continuing upward pressures on wages and prices. Against this backdrop, and in consid- eration of the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, almost all participants agreed that it was appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate 25 basis points at this meeting. Many of these participants observed that a further slow- ing in the pace of rate increases would better allow them to assess the economy’s progress toward the Commit- tee’s goals of maximum employment and price stability as they determine the extent of future policy tightening that will be required to attain a stance that is sufficiently restrictive to achieve these goals. A few participants stated that they favored raising the target range for the federal funds rate 50 basis points at this meeting or that they could have supported raising the target by that amount. The participants favoring a 50-basis point in- crease noted that a larger increase would more quickly bring the target range close to the levels they believed would achieve a sufficiently restrictive stance, taking into account their views of the risks to achieving price stabil- ity in a timely way. All participants agreed that it was appropriate to continue the process of reducing the Fed- eral Reserve’s securities holdings, as described in its pre- viously announced Plans for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve’s Balance Sheet. In discussing the policy outlook, with inflation still well above the Committee’s 2 percent goal and the labor market remaining very tight, all participants continued to anticipate that ongoing increases in the target range for the federal funds rate would be appropriate to achieve the Committee’s objectives. Participants affirmed their strong commitment to returning inflation to the Com- mittee’s 2 percent objective. In determining the extent of future increases in the target range, participants judged that it would be appropriate to take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments. Participants observed that a restrictive policy stance would need to be maintained until the incoming data provided confidence that inflation was on a sustained downward path to 2 percent, which was likely to take some time. Participants discussed the heightened uncertainty re- garding the economic outlook and a number of factors that could affect inflation and real economic activity. Participants generally noted that the Committee’s future decisions regarding policy would continue to be in- formed by the incoming data and their implications for the outlook for economic activity and inflation. A num- ber of participants observed that financial conditions had eased in recent months, which some noted could necessitate a tighter stance of monetary policy. Participants also discussed a number of risk-manage- ment considerations related to the conduct of monetary policy. Almost all participants observed that slowing the pace of rate increases at the current juncture would allow for appropriate risk management as the Committee as- sessed the extent of further tightening needed to meet the Committee’s goals. Several of those participants ob- served that risks to the economic outlook were becom- ing more balanced. With inflation still well above the Committee’s longer-run goal, participants generally noted that upside risks to the inflation outlook remained a key factor shaping the policy outlook, and that main- taining a restrictive policy stance until inflation is clearly on a path toward 2 percent is appropriate from a risk- management perspective. A number of participants ob- served that a policy stance that proved to be insuffi- ciently restrictive could halt recent progress in moderat- ing inflationary pressures, leading inflation to remain above the Committee’s 2 percent objective for a longer period, and pose a risk of inflation expectations becom- ing unanchored. Participants noted that the runoff of the balance sheet had been proceeding smoothly. A few participants ob- served that money markets could experience some tem- porary pressures as reserves declined if use of the Fed- eral Reserve’s ON RRP facility continued to remain high. They noted, however, that such pressures, should they occur, would likely cause an upward re-pricing of private money-market rates that could encourage market participants to reduce their use of the facility. Committee Policy Actions In their discussion of monetary policy for this meeting, members agreed that recent indicators pointed to mod- est growth in spending and production. Members also concurred that job gains had been robust in recent months, and the unemployment rate had remained low. Members agreed that inflation had eased somewhat but remained elevated. Members concurred that Russia’s war against Ukraine was causing tremendous human and economic hardship and was contributing to elevated global uncertainty. Members also concurred that they remained highly attentive to inflation risks. _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Minutes of the Meeting of January 31–February 1, 2023 Page 11 Members agreed that the Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 per- cent over the longer run. In support of these goals, members agreed to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 4½ to 4¾ percent. Members anticipated that ongoing increases in the target range would be ap- propriate in order to attain a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 per- cent over time. Members concurred that, in determining the extent of future increases in the target range, they would take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy af- fects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments. In addition, members agreed that they would continue reducing the Federal Reserve’s holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities, as described in its previously announced plans. The Committee remained strongly committed to returning inflation to its 2 percent objective. Members agreed that, in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, they would continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. They would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals. Mem- bers agreed that their assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation ex- pectations, and financial and international develop- ments. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the following domestic policy directive, for release at 2:00 p.m.: “Effective February 2, 2023, the Federal Open Market Committee directs the Desk to: • Undertake open market operations as nec- essary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of 4½ to 4¾ percent. • Conduct overnight repurchase agreement operations with a minimum bid rate of 4.75 percent and with an aggregate opera- tion limit of $500 billion; the aggregate op- eration limit can be temporarily increased at the discretion of the Chair. • Conduct overnight reverse repurchase agreement operations at an offering rate of 4.55 percent and with a per-counterparty limit of $160 billion per day; the per-coun- terparty limit can be temporarily increased at the discretion of the Chair. • Roll over at auction the amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s hold- ings of Treasury securities maturing in each calendar month that exceeds a cap of $60 billion per month. Redeem Treasury coupon securities up to this monthly cap and Treasury bills to the extent that coupon principal payments are less than the monthly cap. • Reinvest into agency mortgage-backed se- curities (MBS) the amount of principal pay- ments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of agency debt and agency MBS received in each calendar month that exceeds a cap of $35 billion per month. • Allow modest deviations from stated amounts for reinvestments, if needed for operational reasons. • Engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settle- ment of the Federal Reserve’s agency MBS transactions.” The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below for release at 2:00 p.m.: “Recent indicators point to modest growth in spending and production. Job gains have been robust in recent months, and the unemploy- ment rate has remained low. Inflation has eased somewhat but remains elevated. Russia’s war against Ukraine is causing tremen- dous human and economic hardship and is con- tributing to elevated global uncertainty. The Committee is highly attentive to inflation risks. The Committee seeks to achieve maximum em- ployment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. In support of these goals, the Committee decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 4½ to 4¾ percent. The Committee anticipates that ongoing in- creases in the target range will be appropriate in order to attain a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to Page 12 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ 2 percent over time. In determining the extent of future increases in the target range, the Com- mittee will take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial devel- opments. In addition, the Committee will con- tinue reducing its holdings of Treasury securi- ties and agency debt and agency mortgage- backed securities, as described in its previously announced plans. The Committee is strongly committed to returning inflation to its 2 percent objective. In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals. The Committee’s assessments will take into account a wide range of information, in- cluding readings on labor market conditions, in- flation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.” Voting for this action: Jerome H.

The Vice Chair for Supervision described the developments, in- cluding those at Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank, and Page 2 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Credit Suisse. He also described actions taken by the Federal Reserve and other regulatory agencies in re- sponse. He noted that the U.S. banking system is sound and resilient. He also noted that he will be leading a re- view of the supervision and regulation of Silicon Valley Bank, and that the Federal Reserve System will apply what is learned from the review to strengthen its super- visory and regulatory practices as appropriate. Developments in Financial Markets and Open Market Operations The manager turned first to a review of U.S. financial market developments over the intermeeting period. Early in the period, firmer-than-expected data and policy communications pushed interest rates higher and equity prices lower. Developments in the banking sector later in the period were met with sharp reductions in Treasury yields, particularly at shorter tenors. Treasury market li- quidity was poor and implied volatility was high, but the market remained functional amid substantial trading ac- tivity. Higher Treasury market volatility contributed to wider spreads for household and business borrowing. Financial conditions tightened considerably over the in- termeeting period as a whole. Market contacts observed that the recent developments in the banking system will likely result in a pullback in bank lending, which would not be reflected in most common financial conditions indexes. Following the banking-sector developments, equity prices for large U.S. banks underperformed the broad market; equity prices for U.S. regional banks gen- erally underperformed by relatively more. Regarding the outlook for inflation in the United States, market-based measures of inflation compensation over shorter horizons rose over the period, although com- pensation retraced a good portion of its increase later in the period as markets reacted to the developments in the banking sector. Forward inflation compensation measures continued to indicate that longer-term infla- tion expectations remained well anchored. Measures of inflation expectations from the Open Market Desk’s Survey of Primary Dealers and Survey of Market Partic- ipants moved higher at shorter horizons and were little changed at longer horizons. Regarding the outlook for monetary policy, market- based measures of policy expectations suggested that the federal funds rate would reach a peak in May 2023 and that the target range would then move lower. However, the medians of respondents’ modal expectations of the federal funds rate from the Desk surveys did not show any declines in the target range through the end of 2023. Risk and liquidity premiums embedded in market prices may have driven a good part of the difference between survey and market measures. The median respondent expected the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) projections for the federal funds rate at the end of 2023 and 2024 to shift 25 basis points higher. However, in- formation gathered after the Desk surveys closed sug- gests that those expectations had declined some, to a level comparable with the December SEP. Survey re- sponses suggested only modest changes in expectations for balance sheet policy. The manager turned next to a discussion of operations and money markets. Federal funds volumes fell sharply for a few days late in the period as Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLBs) sought to maintain liquidity in order to meet increased demand for advances by member banks. Money market rates remained broadly stable, and se- cured and unsecured money market rates, including the effective fed funds rate, traded well within the target range. Use of U.S. dollar liquidity swap lines with for- eign central banks had been minimal, indicating that market participants did not face significant difficulties in obtaining dollar funding from private sources. Borrowing from the new Bank Term Funding Program had been small relative to discount window borrowing, which had increased to record levels. Use of the over- night reverse repurchase agreement (ON RRP) facility fell, especially for money market mutual funds (MMFs), as the supply of short-term securities at attractive rates increased. By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk’s domestic transactions over the intermeeting period. There were no intervention operations in foreign curren- cies for the System’s account during the intermeeting pe- riod. Staff Review of the Economic Situation The information available at the time of the March 21– 22 meeting indicated that labor market conditions re- mained tight in January and February, with robust job gains and the unemployment rate near a historical low. Consumer price inflation—as measured by the 12-month percent change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE)—was still elevated in January. Real gross domestic product (GDP) appeared to be expanding at a modest pace in the first quarter. Although financial market data had shown reactions to developments in the banking sector late in the intermeet- ing period, there were essentially no economic data avail- able that covered this period. Minutes of the Meeting of March 21–22, 2023 Page 3 _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Total nonfarm payroll employment increased at a faster monthly pace in January and February than in the fourth quarter of last year. The unemployment rate was little changed and stood at 3.6 percent in February. Over the past two months, the unemployment rate for African Americans was unchanged, on net, and the unemploy- ment rate for Hispanics moved up; the unemployment rates for both groups remained above the aggregate measure. The aggregate measures of both the labor force participation rate and the employment-to- population ratio increased slightly. The private-sector job openings rate in January—as measured by the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey—was little changed, on balance, since November and remained high. Recent indicators of nominal wage growth had slowed but continued to be elevated. In February, the 3-month change in average hourly earnings for all employees was at an annual rate of 3.6 percent, slower than its 12-month pace of 4.6 percent. Over the four quarters of 2022, total labor compensation per hour in the business sector—as measured by the Productivity and Costs data—increased 4.5 percent, below its pace in the previous year. Consumer price inflation remained elevated early in the year. Total PCE price inflation was 5.4 percent over the 12 months ending in January, and core PCE price infla- tion—which excludes changes in consumer energy prices and many consumer food prices—was 4.7 per- cent. The trimmed mean measure of 12-month PCE price inflation constructed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas was 4.6 percent in January. In February, the 12-month change in the consumer price index (CPI) was 6.0 percent, and core CPI inflation was 5.5 percent. The CPI, along with data from the producer price index, pointed to some slowing in PCE price inflation in Feb- ruary. The latest survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations from the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers, the Survey of Professional Fore- casters, and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s Survey of Consumer Expectations remained within the range of their values reported in recent months, while near-term measures of inflation expectations from these surveys moved down. Real GDP growth seemed to be expanding at a modest pace in the first quarter. Gains in consumer spending had picked up in recent months, but growth in business fixed investment was slowing and residential investment was continuing to decline. After contracting over the second half of last year, manufacturing output expanded moderately, on average, over January and February, but near-term indicators—such as national and regional in- dexes for new orders—pointed to softening factory out- put in the coming months. The nominal U.S. international trade deficit registered a record high in 2022. The trade deficit had been narrow- ing since March of last year but resumed widening in De- cember and January. Real goods imports rose in Decem- ber and January, led by increases in imports of consumer goods and automotive products. Real goods exports also increased, but by less than imports. Indicators suggested that foreign economic growth re- bounded in the first quarter of 2023 as China reopened rapidly from its COVID-19-related shutdowns and Eu- rope’s economy proved to be resilient to the energy price shock stemming from Russia’s war against Ukraine and benefited from a mild winter that reduced energy de- mand. Manufacturing activity in emerging Asia showed signs of a turnaround from its pronounced slowdown since mid-2022. The recent developments in the bank- ing sector led to some tightening of financial conditions abroad. Oil prices edged down despite China’s rapid re- opening and the implementation of the European Un- ion’s embargo on Russian refined oil products. Retail energy inflation continued to slow, contributing to an easing of headline consumer price inflation in many ad- vanced foreign economies (AFEs). In contrast, core in- flation has shown little sign of easing in most foreign economies amid tight labor markets. In response, many foreign central banks continued their monetary policy tightening, although some have either paused or indi- cated that a pause soon was possible, citing the im- portance of assessing the cumulative effects of past pol- icy rate increases. Staff Review of the Financial Situation Over the first several weeks of the intermeeting period, incoming economic data and FOMC communications appeared to refocus market participants on upside risks to inflation and policy rates, with the market-implied policy rate path steepening, nominal Treasury yields ris- ing, near-term inflation compensation measures increas- ing, and broad stock market price indexes declining. Fi- nancing conditions for businesses, households, and mu- nicipalities had tightened during this period and were moderately restrictive overall, as borrowing costs in- creased notably with the expected path of policy rates and Treasury yields and as some lenders appeared to tighten nonprice borrowing terms. Nonetheless, lending volumes were generally solid. Credit quality was strong Page 4 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ overall, although it had worsened a bit for some borrow- ers. Expectations for future credit quality continued to deteriorate in some markets. Pricing in financial markets changed notably in the latter part of the intermeeting period, amid developments in the banking sector. Treasury yields and policy rate ex- pectations moved down significantly, while broad stock price indexes rose somewhat. The market-implied pol- icy rate path shifted down sizably, with the federal funds rate expected to peak in May before decreasing after- ward. Further out, OIS (overnight index swap) quotes at the end of the intermeeting period indicated that the expected federal funds rate at year-end 2024 was 3.28 percent, about 50 basis points lower than before the closures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank but somewhat higher than at the time of the February FOMC meeting. Treasury yields declined, especially at shorter maturities, reflecting downward revisions in pol- icy rate expectations and the effects of flight to safety. Inflation compensation declined, especially at short ma- turities, likely reflecting, in part, a relatively larger decline in risk premiums on nominal Treasury securities relative to Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities due to strong safe-haven demands. Late in the intermeeting period, U.S. bank stock prices declined notably. Regional banks with unusually large reliance on uninsured deposits and holdings of securities with significant unrealized mark-to-market losses expe- rienced larger declines in stock prices. Broad equity prices rose somewhat after the closures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, reportedly driven by inves- tors’ reassessment of the outlook for interest rates, and after the announcement that UBS had agreed to buy Credit Suisse. The VIX—the one-month option- implied volatility on the S&P 500—increased to about 26.5 percent following the closures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, but it subsequently declined to 21 percent—around the 70th percentile of its histori- cal distribution. Swaption-implied volatilities of short- term interest rates increased notably during this period, reflecting increased uncertainty about the interest rate outlook. Some of the pricing moves in asset markets may have been amplified by impaired liquidity condi- tions. Despite deteriorating liquidity conditions in Treasury, bond, and equity markets, market functioning remained orderly. Over the intermeeting period, foreign financial markets were volatile as investors’ focus shifted from resilience in economic activity and stubbornly high core inflation across advanced economies earlier in the period to stresses in the global banking sector more recently. Ear- lier in the period, yields and market-based measures of inflation expectations in the AFEs increased notably, driven by spillovers from U.S. Treasury yields as well as upside surprises in economic and inflation data for AFEs. Later in the period, developments in the banking sector led to large declines in advanced-economy yields, and, on net, AFE yields declined slightly. Additionally, for the intermeeting period overall, the staff’s dollar in- dex rose moderately, corporate and emerging market economy sovereign credit spreads widened, and foreign equity indexes generally moved lower, with bank equities falling notably. U.S. unsecured funding markets showed some signs of pressure later in the intermeeting period. Issuance of commercial paper (CP) and negotiable certificates of de- posit (NCDs) dropped a touch over the entire period, and the fraction of CP issuance with overnight maturi- ties increased but remained within normal ranges. Spreads of term CP and NCDs widened some, and spreads for issuers with lower credit ratings rose more, but other unsecured spreads remained within normal ranges. Prime MMFs experienced outflows, while gov- ernment MMFs had inflows. The effective federal funds rate was little changed after the closures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. Amid these developments, federal funds volumes ini- tially declined sharply as the FHLBs reduced their activ- ity in the federal funds market in order to meet increased demand for advances by member banks; market volume subsequently rebounded partially. Activity in the repur- chase agreement market was robust, and trading volume remained within recent ranges. ON RRP take-up re- mained within recent ranges as well. Borrowing costs for businesses, households, and munic- ipalities rose notably in the early part of the intermeeting period, mostly in line with increases in the federal funds rate and Treasury yields. Since the closures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, spreads on corporate bonds, municipal bonds, and leveraged loans rose, with speculative-grade corporate bond spreads registering the largest moves; spreads remained at moderate levels rela- tive to their historical distributions. Investment-grade corporate yields and municipal yields were down mod- erately, whereas speculative-grade corporate yields and leveraged loan yields were up modestly. Mortgage rates were unchanged amid an increase in mortgage-backed securities (MBS) spreads. Based on data that do not cover the period following the closures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, Minutes of the Meeting of March 21–22, 2023 Page 5 _____________________________________________________________________________________________ nonprice terms and standards appeared to tighten some- what in a number of markets. Nevertheless, generally solid funding flows suggest that most firms and house- holds had remained broadly able to access funding. Data on credit conditions following the developments in the banking sector were limited. After the two bank clo- sures, issuance of municipal bond and leveraged loans was sluggish, and gross issuance of corporate bonds fell to near zero. Mortgage loans to households remained available. The credit quality of businesses and households was largely stable over the intermeeting period. However, measures of credit performance showed some signs of weakening. Leveraged loan credit quality deteriorated somewhat after the closures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. Credit quality for residential mortgages remained unchanged. Staff Economic Outlook For some time, the forecast for the U.S. economy pre- pared by the staff had featured subdued real GDP growth for this year and some softening in the labor market. Given their assessment of the potential eco- nomic effects of the recent banking-sector develop- ments, the staff’s projection at the time of the March meeting included a mild recession starting later this year, with a recovery over the subsequent two years. Real GDP growth in 2024 was projected to remain below the staff’s estimate of potential output growth, and then GDP growth in 2025 was expected to be above that of potential. Resource utilization in both product and labor markets was forecast to be much less tight than in the January projection. The level of real output was pro- jected to move below the staff’s estimate of potential output in early 2024, more than a year sooner than in the previous projection. Likewise, the unemployment rate was projected to rise above the staff’s estimate of its nat- ural rate early next year. On a four-quarter change basis, total PCE price inflation was forecast to be 2.8 percent this year, with core infla- tion at 3.5 percent. Core goods inflation was projected to move down further this year and then remain sub- dued; housing services inflation was expected to peak later this year and then move down, while core nonhous- ing services inflation was forecast to slow gradually as nominal wage growth eased further. Reflecting the ef- fects of less projected tightness in product and labor markets, core inflation was forecast to slow sharply next year. With steep declines in consumer energy prices and a substantial moderation in food price inflation expected for this year, total inflation was projected to step down markedly this year and then to track core inflation over the following two years. In 2024 and 2025, both total and core PCE price inflation were expected to be near 2 percent. The staff judged that the uncertainty around the baseline projection was much greater than at the time of the pre- vious forecast. In particular, the staff viewed the risks around the baseline projection as determined im- portantly by banking conditions and the implications for financial conditions. If the effects of the recent devel- opments in the banking sector on macroeconomic con- ditions were to abate quickly, then the risks around the baseline would be tilted to the upside for both economic activity and inflation. If banking and financial condi- tions and their effects on macroeconomic conditions were to deteriorate more than assumed in the baseline, then the risks around the baseline would be skewed to the downside for both economic activity and inflation, particularly because historical recessions related to finan- cial market problems tend to be more severe and persis- tent than average recessions. Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, participants submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and infla- tion for each year from 2023 through 2025 and over the longer run. The projections were based on their individ- ual assessments of appropriate monetary policy, includ- ing the path of the federal funds rate. The longer-run projections represented each participant’s assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy. An SEP was released to the public following the conclu- sion of the meeting. In their discussion of current economic conditions, par- ticipants noted that recent indicators pointed to modest growth in spending and production. At the same time, though, participants noted that job gains had picked up in recent months and were running at a robust pace; the unemployment rate had remained low. Inflation re- mained elevated. Participants agreed that the U.S. bank- ing system remained sound and resilient. They com- mented that recent developments in the banking sector were likely to result in tighter credit conditions for households and businesses and to weigh on economic activity, hiring, and inflation. Participants agreed that the extent of these effects was uncertain. Against this Page 6 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ background, participants continued to be highly atten- tive to inflation risks. In assessing the economic outlook, participants noted that since they met in February, data on inflation, em- ployment, and economic activity generally came in stronger than expected. They also noted, however, that the developments in the banking sector that had oc- curred late in the intermeeting period affected their views of the economic and policy outlook and the un- certainty surrounding that outlook. Based on incoming economic data, participants’ assessments of the effects of cumulative policy firming, and their initial views on the likely economic effect of the recent banking-sector developments, participants generally expected real GDP to grow this year at a pace well below its long-run trend rate. With inflation remaining unacceptably high, partic- ipants expected that a period of below-trend growth in real GDP would be needed to bring aggregate demand into better balance with aggregate supply and thereby re- duce inflationary pressures. Many participants remarked that the incoming data before the onset of the banking- sector stresses had led them to see the appropriate path for the federal funds rate as somewhat higher than their assessment at the time of the December meeting. After incorporating the banking-sector developments, partici- pants indicated that their policy rate projections were now about unchanged from December. Participants agreed that the actions taken so far by the Federal Reserve in coordination with other government agencies, as well as actions taken by foreign authorities to address banking and financial stresses outside the U.S., had helped calm conditions in the banking sector. Even with the actions, participants recognized that there was significant uncertainty as to how those conditions would evolve. Participants assessed that the develop- ments so far would likely lead to some weakening of credit conditions, as some banks were likely to tighten lending standards amid rising funding costs and in- creased concerns about liquidity. Participants noted that it was too early to assess with confidence the magnitude of the effect of a credit tightening on economic activity and inflation, and that it was important to continue to closely monitor developments and update assessments of the actual and expected effects of credit tightening. Several participants noted that regional and community banks, a small number of which had come under signif- icant stress, were important in small business and mid- dle-market lending and were providing critical and unique financial services to many communities and in- dustries. In their discussion of the household sector, participants noted that incoming data on real consumer expenditures showed a pickup in spending in January and February. They attributed the pickup to strong job gains, rising real disposable income, and households continuing to run down excess savings accumulated during the pandemic. They also noted that an atypically warm start to this year, along with challenges in seasonally adjusting data, likely contributed to the pickup in the reported data. A few participants observed that credit card delinquencies, par- ticularly for lower-income households, had risen in the face of elevated inflation and higher nominal interest rates. Participants noted that recent developments in the banking sector and the associated rise in uncertainty would likely weigh on consumer sentiment and that in- creased caution on the part of consumers could restrain spending. A couple of participants observed that high- frequency measures of consumer sentiment had not yet shown a significant change following the recent devel- opments in the banking sector, although they also acknowledged that the situation was fluid. Regarding the business sector, participants observed that growth in business fixed investment was being re- strained by tighter financial conditions that reflected cu- mulative policy firming to date. Participants expected the likely tightening of credit conditions due to the re- cent developments in the banking sector to further weigh on investment spending. In addition, the bank- ing-sector developments could damp business confi- dence and increase firms’ caution, reducing their willing- ness to hire new workers. However, a few participants mentioned that their nonbank business contacts re- ported that the banking-sector developments so far had not resulted in significant changes in their hiring and capital spending plans or sales expectations, though their contacts also acknowledged increased uncertainties around their outlooks. Participants agreed that the labor market remained very tight. Job gains had picked up to a robust pace in Janu- ary and February, and the unemployment rate remained low. Participants noted some signs of improvement in the imbalances between demand and supply in the labor market, including further declines in the quits rate as well as an increase in the overall labor force participation rate and the return of the prime-age participation rate to pre- pandemic levels. Furthermore, participants observed that wage growth appeared to be slowing gradually amid this apparent easing in labor demand and increase in la- bor supply. However, participants assessed that labor demand continued to substantially exceed labor supply, and several participants pointed out that wage growth Minutes of the Meeting of March 21–22, 2023 Page 7 _____________________________________________________________________________________________ was still well above the rates that would be consistent over the longer run with the 2 percent inflation objec- tive, given current estimates of trend productivity growth. Participants expected that, under appropriate monetary policy, supply and demand conditions in the labor market will come into better balance over time, easing upward pressures on wages and prices. With inflation still well above the Committee’s longer- run goal of 2 percent, participants agreed that inflation was unacceptably high. Participants commented that re- cent inflation data indicated slower-than-expected pro- gress on disinflation. In particular, they noted that revi- sions to the price data had indicated less disinflation at the end of last year than had been previously reported and that inflation was still quite elevated. Participants noted that, on a 12-month basis, core goods price infla- tion declined as supply chains continued to improve, but the pace of the decline had slowed, highlighting the still uncertain nature of the disinflationary process. Partici- pants expected that housing services inflation would likely begin to slow in coming months, reflecting contin- ued smaller increases, or potentially declines, in rents on new leases. Regarding prices for core services excluding housing, participants agreed that there was little evidence pointing to disinflation in this component. Participants generally judged that some more easing in labor market tightness and slowing in nominal wage growth would be necessary for sustained disinflation. Additionally, partic- ipants observed that indicators of short-term inflation expectations from surveys of households and businesses had come down further, while longer-term inflation ex- pectations remained well anchored. Participants also discussed the potential effect on inflation of the devel- opments in the banking sector. They noted that a tight- ening of credit conditions was likely to weigh on aggre- gate demand, which in turn could help reduce inflation- ary pressures. However, participants observed that the size of such an effect was highly uncertain. Participants generally observed that the recent develop- ments in the banking sector had further increased the already-high level of uncertainty associated with their outlooks for economic activity, the labor market, and in- flation. Participants saw risks to economic activity as weighted to the downside. As a source of downside risk to activity, they noted the possibility that banks would reduce the supply of credit by more than expected, which could restrain economic activity significantly. Participants mentioned potential intensification of Rus- sia’s war against Ukraine as an additional source of downside risk to the economic outlook. Participants generally saw risks to inflation as weighted to the upside, though they also recognized some downside risks to in- flation. As a source of upside risk to inflation, partici- pants cited the possibility of more-persistent-than- anticipated price pressures, due to, for example, surpris- ingly resilient labor demand. As a source of downside risk to inflation, participants noted that if banks reduce the supply of credit by more than expected, the likely restraint on economic activity and hiring could put addi- tional downward pressure on inflation. In their consideration of appropriate monetary policy ac- tions at this meeting, participants concurred that infla- tion remained well above the Committee’s longer-run goal of 2 percent and that the recent data on inflation provided few signs that inflation pressures were abating at a pace sufficient to return inflation to 2 percent over time. Participants also noted that recent developments in the banking sector would likely result in tighter credit conditions for households and businesses and weigh on economic activity, hiring, and inflation, though the ex- tent of these effects was highly uncertain. Against this backdrop, all participants agreed that it was appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate 25 ba- sis points to 4¾ to 5 percent. All participants also agreed that it was appropriate to continue the process of reduc- ing the Federal Reserve’s securities holdings, as de- scribed in its previously announced Plans for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve’s Balance Sheet. Several participants noted that, in their policy delibera- tions, they considered whether it would be appropriate to hold the target range steady at this meeting. They noted that doing so would allow more time to assess the financial and economic effects of recent banking-sector developments and of the cumulative tightening of mon- etary policy. However, these participants also observed that the actions taken by the Federal Reserve in coordi- nation with other government agencies helped calm con- ditions in the banking sector and lessen the near-term risks to economic activity and inflation. Consequently, these participants judged it appropriate to increase the target range 25 basis points because of elevated inflation, the strength of the recent economic data, and their com- mitment to bring inflation down to the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run goal. Some participants noted that given persistently high in- flation and the strength of the recent economic data, they would have considered a 50 basis point increase in the target range to have been appropriate at this meeting in the absence of the recent developments in the banking sector. However, due to the potential for banking-sector developments to tighten financial conditions and to Page 8 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ weigh on economic activity and inflation, they judged it prudent to increase the target range by a smaller incre- ment at this meeting. These participants noted that do- ing so would also allow the Committee time to better assess the effects of banking-sector developments on credit conditions and the economy as the Committee moved toward a sufficiently restrictive stance of mone- tary policy. Participants observed that the actions taken by the Fed- eral Reserve in coordination with other government agencies in the days preceding the meeting had served to calm conditions in the banking sector. Participants noted that the most significant issues appeared to have been limited to a small number of banks with poor risk- management practices and that the banking system re- mained sound and resilient. Participants emphasized that the Federal Reserve should use its liquidity and lender-of-last-resort tools, as well as its microprudential and macroprudential regulatory and supervisory tools, to address stress in the banking sector and to mitigate fu- ture financial stability risks. Participants agreed that re- cent banking developments would factor into the Com- mittee’s monetary policy decisions to the extent that these developments affect the outlook for employment and inflation and the risks surrounding the outlook. Par- ticipants reaffirmed their strong commitment to return- ing inflation to the Committee’s 2 percent objective. In discussing the policy outlook, participants observed that inflation remained much too high and that the labor market remained tight; as a result, they anticipated that some additional policy firming may be appropriate to at- tain a sufficiently restrictive policy stance to return infla- tion to 2 percent over time. Many participants noted that the likely effects of recent banking-sector develop- ments on economic activity and inflation had led them to lower their assessments of the federal funds rate target range that would be sufficiently restrictive compared with assessments based solely on the recent economic data. In determining the extent of future increases in the target range, participants judged that it would be appro- priate to take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy af- fects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments. In light of the highly uncertain economic outlook, par- ticipants underscored the importance of closely moni- toring incoming information and assessing the implica- tions for future monetary policy decisions. Participants noted that it would be particularly important to review incoming information regarding changes in credit con- ditions and credit flows as well as broader changes in fi- nancial conditions and to assess the implications for eco- nomic activity, labor markets, and inflation. Several par- ticipants emphasized the need to retain flexibility and optionality in determining the appropriate stance of monetary policy given the highly uncertain economic outlook. Participants emphasized a number of risk-management considerations related to the conduct of monetary pol- icy. Some participants observed that downside risks to growth and upside risks to unemployment had increased because of the risk that banking-sector developments could lead to further tightening of credit conditions and weigh on economic activity. Some participants also noted that, with inflation still well above the Commit- tee’s longer-run goal and the recent economic data re- maining strong, upside risks to the inflation outlook re- mained a key factor shaping the policy outlook, and that maintaining a restrictive policy stance until inflation is clearly on a downward path toward 2 percent would be appropriate from a risk-management perspective. Sev- eral participants noted the importance of longer-term in- flation expectations remaining anchored and remarked that the longer inflation remained elevated, the greater the risk of inflation expectations becoming unanchored. Participants generally agreed on the importance of closely monitoring incoming information and its impli- cations for the economic outlook, and that they were prepared to adjust their views on the appropriate stance of monetary policy in response to the incoming data and emerging risks to the economic outlook. Committee Policy Actions In their discussion of monetary policy for this meeting, members agreed that recent indicators pointed to mod- est growth in spending and production. They also con- curred that job gains had picked up in recent months and were running at a robust pace, that the unemployment rate had remained low, and that inflation remains ele- vated. Members concurred that the U.S. banking system is sound and resilient. They also agreed that recent de- velopments were likely to result in tighter credit condi- tions for households and businesses and to weigh on economic activity, hiring, and inflation, but that the ex- tent of these effects was uncertain. Members also con- curred that they remained highly attentive to inflation risks. Members agreed that the Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 per- cent over the longer run. In support of these goals, Minutes of the Meeting of March 21–22, 2023 Page 9 _____________________________________________________________________________________________ members agreed to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 4¾ to 5 percent. Members agreed that they would closely monitor incoming information and assess the implications for monetary policy. Given recent de- velopments, members anticipated that some additional policy firming may be appropriate in order to attain a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent over time. Members con- curred that, in determining the extent of future increases in the target range, they would take into account the cu- mulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and in- flation, and economic and financial developments. In addition, members agreed that they would continue re- ducing the Federal Reserve’s holdings of Treasury secu- rities and agency debt and agency MBS, as described in its previously announced plans. All members affirmed that they remained strongly committed to returning in- flation to its 2 percent objective. Members agreed that, in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, they would continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. They would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals. Mem- bers agreed that their assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation ex- pectations, and financial and international develop- ments. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Open Market Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive, for release at 2:00 p.m.: “Effective March 23, 2023, the Federal Open Market Committee directs the Desk to: • Undertake open market operations as nec- essary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of 4¾ to 5 percent. • Conduct standing overnight repurchase agreement operations with a minimum bid rate of 5 percent and with an aggregate op- eration limit of $500 billion. • Conduct standing overnight reverse repur- chase agreement operations at an offering rate of 4.8 percent and with a per-counter- party limit of $160 billion per day. • Roll over at auction the amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s hold- ings of Treasury securities maturing in each calendar month that exceeds a cap of $60 billion per month. Redeem Treasury coupon securities up to this monthly cap and Treasury bills to the extent that coupon principal payments are less than the monthly cap. • Reinvest into agency mortgage-backed se- curities (MBS) the amount of principal pay- ments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of agency debt and agency MBS received in each calendar month that exceeds a cap of $35 billion per month. • Allow modest deviations from stated amounts for reinvestments, if needed for operational reasons. • Engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settle- ment of the Federal Reserve’s agency MBS transactions.” The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below for release at 2:00 p.m.: “Recent indicators point to modest growth in spending and production. Job gains have picked up in recent months and are running at a robust pace; the unemployment rate has re- mained low. Inflation remains elevated. The U.S. banking system is sound and resilient. Recent developments are likely to result in tighter credit conditions for households and businesses and to weigh on economic activity, hiring, and inflation. The extent of these effects is uncertain. The Committee remains highly at- tentive to inflation risks. The Committee seeks to achieve maximum em- ployment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. In support of these goals, the Committee decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 4¾ to 5 percent. The Committee will closely monitor incoming information and assess the implications for monetary policy. The Committee anticipates that some additional policy firming may be ap- propriate in order to attain a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to return in- flation to 2 percent over time. In determining Page 10 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ the extent of future increases in the target range, the Committee will take into account the cumu- lative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and finan- cial developments. In addition, the Committee will continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mort- gage-backed securities, as described in its previ- ously announced plans. The Committee is strongly committed to returning inflation to its 2 percent objective. In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals. The Committee’s assessments will take into account a wide range of information, in- cluding readings on labor market conditions, in- flation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.” Voting for this action: Jerome H. Powell, John C. Williams, Michael S. Barr, Michelle W. Bowman, Lisa D. Cook, Austan D. Goolsbee, Patrick Harker, Philip N. Jefferson, Neel Kashkari, Lorie K. Logan, and Christopher J. Waller.

Wood, Special Adviser to the Board, Division of Board Members, Board Rebecca Zarutskie, Special Adviser to the Board, Division of Board Members, Board Developments in Financial Markets and Open Market Operations The manager turned first to a review of developments in financial markets. Asset prices were less volatile and financial market conditions eased somewhat over the intermeeting period as investor sentiment around the banking system stabilized. On net, nominal Treasury yields declined, equities appreciated, credit spreads tightened, and the trade-weighted value of the dollar de- preciated. Measures of implied volatility declined across markets. Policy-sensitive rates, however, fluctu- ated a fair amount over the period, particularly in re- sponse to economic data but also because of market perceptions of risk and liquidity conditions. Treasury market liquidity improved somewhat over the period but remained challenged. Treasury cash and futures markets continued to function in an orderly manner de- spite the lower-than-normal liquidity. Regarding developments late in the intermeeting pe- riod, the closure and acquisition of First Republic Bank were seen as orderly, though investors remained fo- cused on stresses in the banking sector. In addition, the U.S. Treasury Department announced it may not be able to fully satisfy the federal government’s obligations as early as June 1 if the debt limit is not raised or sus- pended, but that the actual date this event would occur might come a number of weeks later. Yields on Treas- ury bills and coupon securities maturing in the first half of June increased notably amid significant volatility. Deposit outflows from small and mid-sized banks largely stopped in late March and April. Although eq- uity prices for regional banks fell further over the pe- riod, for the vast majority of banks these declines ap- peared primarily to reflect expectations for lower prof- itability rather than solvency concerns. Market partici- pants remained alert to the possibility of another inten- sification of banking stress. Responses to the Open Market Desk’s Survey of Pri- mary Dealers and Survey of Market Participants suggest that investors’ macroeconomic outlooks were little changed from March despite ongoing focus on the im- plications of the expected tightening of credit. Re- spondents saw upside inflation risks, albeit less than in March. Market participants broadly expected a 25 basis point rate increase at the May meeting and saw the resulting rate as the likely peak for the current tightening cycle. Survey respondents assigned a much higher probability to the peak federal funds rate being between 5 and 5.25 percent than they did in March. However, re- spondents still assigned a substantial probability that the peak rate may turn out to be above 5.25 percent. Re- spondents expected the peak rate to be maintained through the January 2024 FOMC meeting. Regarding the balance sheet and money markets, bal- ance sheet runoff continued to proceed smoothly and overnight secured and unsecured rates continued to trade well within the target range for the federal funds rate. Respondents to the Desk’s surveys generally ex- pected that overnight reverse repurchase agreement (ON RRP) balances will remain elevated in the near term before declining later this year. The ON RRP fa- cility continued to support effective policy implementa- tion and control over the federal funds rate, providing a strong floor for money market rates. Balances at the ON RRP facility remained within their recent range, in- dicating that use of the facility was not an important factor driving outflows of deposits from the banking system. Use of the ON RRP facility declined at times over the intermeeting period in response to increases in rates on overnight secured money market instruments and on short-term Federal Home Loan Bank debt. The Committee voted unanimously to renew the reciprocal currency arrangements with the Bank of Canada and the Bank of Mexico; these arrangements are associated with the Federal Reserve’s participation in the North American Framework Agreement of 1994. In addition, the Committee voted unanimously to renew the dollar and foreign currency liquidity swap arrangements with the Bank of Canada, the Bank of England, the Bank of Japan, the European Central Bank, and the Swiss National Bank. The votes to renew the Federal Reserve’s participation in these standing arrangements occur annually at the April or May FOMC meeting. By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk’s domestic transactions over the intermeeting period. Minutes of the Meeting of May 2–3, 2023 Page 3 _____________________________________________________________________________________________ There were no intervention operations in foreign currencies for the System’s account during the intermeeting period. Staff Review of the Economic Situation The information available at the time of the May 2–3 meeting indicated that real gross domestic product (GDP) had expanded at a modest pace in the first quarter. Labor market conditions remained tight in March, as job gains were robust and the unemploy- ment rate was low. Consumer price inflation—as meas- ured by the 12-month percent change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE)—con- tinued to be elevated in March. Limited data were avail- able on economic activity during the period after the onset of banking-sector stress in mid-March, although several recent surveys—such as the Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices (SLOOS) in April, the National Federation of Independent Busi- ness’s survey in March, and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s Survey of Consumer Expectations in March—indicated that bank credit conditions were tightening further. The pace of increases in total nonfarm payroll employ- ment slowed in March but was still robust, and the un- employment rate ticked down to 3.5 percent. The un- employment rate for African Americans fell to 5.0 per- cent, and the jobless rate for Hispanics dropped to 4.6 percent. The aggregate measures of both the labor force participation rate and the employment-to-popula- tion ratio edged up. The private-sector job openings rate—as measured by the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey—moved down markedly during Feb- ruary and March but remained high. Recent measures of nominal wage growth continued to ease from their peaks recorded last year but were still elevated. Over the 12 months ending in March, average hourly earnings for all employees rose 4.2 percent, well below its peak of 5.9 percent a year earlier. Over the year ending in March, the employment cost index (ECI) for private-sector workers increased 4.8 percent, down from its peak of 5.5 percent over the year ending in June of last year. Consumer price inflation remained elevated in March but continued to slow. Total PCE price inflation was 4.2 percent over the 12 months ending in March, and core PCE price inflation—which excludes changes in consumer energy prices and many consumer food prices—was 4.6 percent; the total inflation measure was down markedly from its level in January, while the core measure was only slightly lower. The trimmed mean measure of 12-month PCE price inflation constructed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas was 4.7 percent in March. The latest survey-based measures of longer- term inflation expectations from the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers in April and the Fed- eral Reserve Bank of New York’s Survey of Consumer Expectations in March remained within the range of their values reported in recent months; near-term measures of inflation expectations from these surveys moved up but were still below their peaks seen last year. Real GDP growth was modest in the first quarter, led by an increase in PCE. Gains in consumer spending picked up for the quarter as a whole, driven by a surge in January that was followed by a small net decline over February and March. Light motor vehicle sales, how- ever, picked up notably in April. Growth in business fixed investment slowed further in the first quarter, and new orders for nondefense capital goods excluding air- craft continued to decline in March, pointing to weak- ness in capital goods shipments in the near term. Resi- dential investment declined further in the first quarter but at a slower pace than last year. Net exports made a small positive contribution to GDP growth in the first quarter, as exports rebounded more strongly than im- ports from their fourth-quarter declines. U.S. manufac- turing output fell in March, and near-term indicators— such as national and regional indexes for new orders— pointed to more softening in factory output in the com- ing months. Foreign economic activity rebounded in the first quar- ter, reflecting the reopening of China’s economy from its COVID-19-related shutdowns, a pickup in the econ- omies of Canada and Mexico, and the resilience of Eu- rope’s economy to the energy price shock from Russia’s war on Ukraine; a mild winter also helped reduce energy demand in Europe. In contrast, economic growth else- where in emerging Asia was weak in the first quarter mainly due to a pronounced tech-cycle slowdown. Oil prices edged down amid concerns about the global economic outlook. A slowing of retail energy inflation continued to contribute to an easing of headline con- sumer price inflation in many advanced foreign econo- mies (AFEs). Core inflation showed signs of easing in some foreign economies but remained persistently ele- vated amid tight labor markets. Accordingly, many for- eign central banks continued their monetary policy tightening. That said, some central banks paused their policy rate increases or altered their forward guidance amid uncertainty about the global economic outlook Page 4 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ and the recent banking-sector stress. Some also sig- naled a shift toward a more data-dependent approach in future decisions. Staff Review of the Financial Situation Market sentiment improved over the intermeeting pe- riod, with concerns about a sharp near-term decelera- tion in economic activity appearing to recede as stress in the banking sector declined. The market-implied path for the federal funds rate in 2023 increased mod- estly over the period. Broad equity price indexes in- creased, although equity prices of some regional banks were lower, and equity market volatility declined. Fi- nancing conditions continued to be restrictive, and bor- rowing costs remained elevated. Over the intermeeting period, the market-implied path for the federal funds rate in 2023 rose modestly, par- tially unwinding the sharp decline observed in early March due to the banking-sector stress. For 2024 and 2025, the implied policy path based on overnight index swaps fluctuated amid mixed economic data releases, and declined slightly on net. Yields on nominal Treas- ury securities with maturities greater than one year moved lower, and inflation compensation at medium- and long-term horizons edged down slightly. Measures of uncertainty about the path of interest rates declined modestly but remained substantially elevated by histor- ical standards. Broad stock price indexes increased moderately, and the VIX—the one-month option-implied volatility on the S&P 500—decreased notably over the intermeeting pe- riod. However, market participants remained attentive to developments at regional banks. Equity prices at such banks broadly declined over the intermeeting pe- riod in part because of higher funding costs, as well as concerns about profitability and a possible deterioration in the performance of commercial real estate (CRE) loans. Risk sentiment in foreign financial markets also im- proved, on net, over the intermeeting period amid re- duced investor concerns about the banking sector, lead- ing to moderate increases in broad equity indexes and declines in option-implied measures of equity volatility. That said, equity prices for euro-area banks declined somewhat, on net, and remained significantly lower than their levels before the onset of banking stresses in early March. Market expectations of policy rates and sovereign yields were little changed in most AFEs but rose notably in the U.K., in part because of higher-than- expected wage and inflation data. The dollar continued its earlier depreciation as differentials between U.S. and AFE sovereign yields narrowed and global risk senti- ment improved. Outflows from funds dedicated to emerging markets slowed to near zero over the inter- meeting period, while sovereign credit spreads for emerging market economies were little changed on net. U.S. markets for commercial paper (CP) and negotiable certificates of deposit (NCDs) stabilized over the inter- meeting period. Spreads for lower-rated nonfinancial CP, which spiked following Silicon Valley Bank’s clo- sure, narrowed significantly. Outstanding levels of CP and NCDs increased modestly over the intermeeting period, while the share of short-maturity unsecured is- suance of CP and NCDs fell to normal levels, reflecting a net easing of stress associated with regional banks. Conditions in overnight bank funding and repurchase agreement markets remained stable over the intermeet- ing period, and the increase of 25 basis points in the Federal Reserve’s administered rates following the March FOMC meeting fully passed through to over- night money market rates. The effective federal funds rate printed at 4.83 percent every day during the period, while the Secured Overnight Financing Rate averaged 4.81 percent—slightly above the offering rate at the ON RRP facility. Daily take-up in the ON RRP facility remained elevated, reflecting continued significant us- age by money market mutual funds, ongoing uncer- tainty around the policy path, and limited supply of al- ternative investments such as Treasury bills. In domestic credit markets, borrowing costs for busi- nesses and households eased modestly in some markets but remained at elevated levels. Over the intermeeting period, yields on corporate bonds declined moderately, and yields on agency residential mortgage-backed secu- rities and 30-year conforming residential mortgage rates moved a little lower. However, interest rates on short- term small business loans continued to rise through March and reached their highest levels since the Global Financial Crisis. Credit flows for businesses and households slowed moderately, as high borrowing costs and market volatil- ity amid stress in the banking sector appeared to weigh on financing volumes in some markets. While issuance of nonfinancial corporate bonds and leveraged loans slowed notably in mid-March amid stress in the banking sector, issuance normalized over the intermeeting pe- riod as that stress abated later in the month and broader market sentiment rebounded. In April, speculative- grade nonfinancial bond issuance was solid, while in- vestment-grade nonfinancial bond issuance was sub- Minutes of the Meeting of May 2–3, 2023 Page 5 _____________________________________________________________________________________________ dued, in part due to seasonal factors. Growth in com- mercial and industrial (C&I) loans on banks’ books was weak in the first quarter of 2023 relative to its pace in 2022. In the April SLOOS, banks reported further tightening of standards for most loan categories over the past three months, following widespread tightening in pre- vious quarters. Banks of all sizes expected their lending standards to tighten further for the rest of 2023. The most cited reason for tightening C&I standards and terms was a less favorable or more uncertain economic outlook. Mid-sized banks—those that have total con- solidated assets in the range of $50 billion to $250 bil- lion—tightened C&I standards more than other banks and additionally reported that a deterioration in their current or expected liquidity position was an important reason for their tightening. Such banks account for a bit over one-fourth of C&I lending. Banks of all sizes expected to tighten C&I standards further over the re- mainder of the year, with small and mid-sized banks more widely reporting this expectation. Although CRE loan growth on banks’ balance sheets remained robust in the first quarter, the April SLOOS indicated that loan standards across all CRE loan cate- gories tightened further in the first quarter. The re- ported tightening in standards over the first quarter was particularly widespread for mid-sized banks. Banks also reported that they expected to tighten CRE standards further over the remainder of the year, with mid-sized banks very broadly reporting this expectation. Mean- while, commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) issuance was very slow in February and March, amid higher spreads and volatility as well as tighter lending standards. Credit remained broadly available in the residential mortgage market for high-credit-score borrowers who met standard conforming loan criteria, but credit avail- ability for households with lower credit scores remained tight. In the April SLOOS, the net percentages of banks reporting tighter standards for all consumer loan categories during the first quarter were elevated relative to their historical range, and respondents expected that standards would continue to tighten over the remainder of 2023. Even so, consumer loans grew at a robust pace in the first quarter, with a continued strong expansion in revolving credit balances. Overall, the credit quality of most businesses and households remained solid but deteriorated somewhat for businesses with lower credit ratings and for house- holds with lower credit scores. The credit quality of C&I and CRE loans on banks’ balance sheets remained sound as of the end of the fourth quarter of last year. However, in the April SLOOS, banks frequently cited concerns about a deterioration in the quality of their loan portfolios as a reason for expecting to tighten standards over the remainder of the year. The staff provided an update on its assessment of the stability of the financial system. The staff judged that the banking system was sound and resilient despite con- cerns about profitability at some banks. The staff judged that asset valuation pressures remained moder- ate. In particular, the staff noted that the equity risk premium and corporate bond spreads declined over the past few months but remained near historical medians. Valuations in both residential and commercial property markets remained elevated. Rising borrowing costs had contributed to a moderation of price pressures in hous- ing markets, and year-over-year house price increases had decelerated. The staff noted that the CRE sector remained vulnerable to large price declines. This possi- bility seemed particularly salient for office and down- town retail properties given the shift toward telework in many industries. The staff also noted analysis that found that while losses to CRE debt holders could be moderate in aggregate, some banks and the CMBS mar- ket could experience stress should prices of these prop- erties decline significantly. The staff assessed that vulnerabilities associated with household leverage remained at moderate levels. For nonfinancial businesses, debt relative to nominal GDP declined some but continued to be near a historically high level. The ability of nonfinancial firms to service their debt kept pace with rising debt loads and interest rates. In terms of financial-sector leverage, going into the pe- riod of recent bank stress, banks of all sizes appeared strong, with substantial loss-absorbing capacity as measured by regulatory capital ratios well above levels that prevailed before the Great Recession. However, the ratio of tangible common equity to total tangible as- sets at banks—excluding global systemically important banks—had fallen sharply in recent quarters, partly be- cause of a substantial drop in the value of securities held in their portfolios. The majority of the banking system had been able to effectively manage this interest rate risk exposure. However, the failure of three banks re- sulting from poor interest rate risk and liquidity risk management had put stress on some additional banks. For the nonbank sector, leverage at large hedge funds remained somewhat elevated in the third quarter of Page 6 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ 2022, and more recent data from the Senior Credit Of- ficer Opinion Survey on Dealer Financing Terms sug- gested this fact had not changed. With regard to vulnerabilities associated with funding risks, the staff assessed that although funding strains had been notable for some banks, such strains remained low for the banking system as a whole, especially in light of official interventions by the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the U.S. Department of Treasury to support bank depositors. Outflows of funds from bank deposits in mid-March, which were concentrated at a limited number of banks, had slowed. Staff Economic Outlook The economic forecast prepared by the staff for the May FOMC meeting continued to assume that the ef- fects of the expected further tightening in bank credit conditions, amid already tight financial conditions, would lead to a mild recession starting later this year, followed by a moderately paced recovery. Real GDP was projected to decelerate over the next two quarters before declining modestly in both the fourth quarter of this year and the first quarter of next year. Real GDP growth over 2024 and 2025 was projected to be below the staff’s estimate of potential output growth. The un- employment rate was forecast to increase this year, to peak next year, and then to start declining gradually in 2025. Resource utilization in both product and labor markets was forecast to loosen, with the level of real output moving below the staff’s estimate of potential output in early 2024 and the unemployment rate rising above the staff’s estimate of its natural rate at that time. The staff’s core inflation forecast was revised up a little relative to the previous projection. Recent data for core PCE goods prices and the ECI measure of wage growth—the latter of which importantly influences the staff’s projection of core nonhousing services infla- tion—came in above expectations, and the staff judged that supply–demand imbalances in both goods markets and labor markets were easing a bit more slowly than anticipated. On a four-quarter change basis, total PCE price inflation was projected to be 3.1 percent this year, with core inflation at 3.8 percent. Core goods inflation was projected to move down further this year and then remain subdued, housing services inflation was ex- pected to have about peaked in the first quarter and to move down over the rest of the year, and core nonhous- ing services inflation was forecast to slow gradually as nominal wage growth eased further. Reflecting the pro- jected effects of less tightness in resource utilization, core inflation was forecast to slow through next year but remain moderately above 2 percent. With expected declines in consumer energy prices and a substantial moderation in food price inflation, total inflation was projected to run below core inflation this year and next. In 2025, both total and core PCE price inflation were expected to be at about 2 percent. The staff continued to judge that uncertainty around the baseline projection was considerable and still viewed risks as being determined importantly by the im- plications for macroeconomic conditions of develop- ments in the banking sector. If banking-sector stress were to abate more quickly or have less of an effect on macroeconomic conditions than assumed in the base- line, then the risks would be tilted to the upside for eco- nomic activity and inflation, a scenario that the staff viewed as only a little less likely than the baseline. If banking and financial conditions and their effects on macroeconomic conditions were to deteriorate more than assumed in the baseline, then the risks around the baseline would be skewed to the downside for eco- nomic activity and inflation. On balance, the staff saw the risks around the baseline inflation forecast as tilted to the upside, as an upside economic scenario with higher inflation appeared more likely than a downside scenario with lower inflation, and because inflation could continue to be more persistent than expected and inflation expectations could become unanchored after a long period of elevated inflation. Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook In their discussion of current economic conditions, par- ticipants noted that economic activity had expanded at a modest pace in the first quarter. Nonetheless, job gains had been robust in recent months, and the unem- ployment rate had remained low. Inflation remained elevated. Participants agreed that the U.S. banking sys- tem was sound and resilient. They commented that tighter credit conditions for households and businesses were likely to weigh on economic activity, hiring, and inflation. However, participants agreed that the extent of these effects remained uncertain. Against this back- ground, participants concurred that they remained highly attentive to inflation risks. In assessing the economic outlook, participants noted that the growth rate of real GDP in the first quarter of this year was modest despite a pickup in consumer spending, as inventory investment—a volatile cate- gory—declined substantially. Participants generally ex- pected real GDP to grow at a pace below its longer-run Minutes of the Meeting of May 2–3, 2023 Page 7 _____________________________________________________________________________________________ trend rate in 2023, reflecting the effects of restrictive financial conditions. Participants assessed that the cu- mulative tightening of monetary policy over the past year had contributed significantly to more restrictive fi- nancial conditions. They also judged that banking-sec- tor stress would likely weigh further on economic activ- ity, but the extent to which that would be the case re- mained highly uncertain. With inflation well above the Committee’s longer-run 2 percent objective, and core inflation showing only some signs of moderation, par- ticipants expected that a period of below-trend growth in real GDP and some softening in labor market condi- tions would be needed to bring aggregate supply and aggregate demand into better balance and reduce infla- tionary pressures over time. Participants generally noted that the actions taken by the Federal Reserve and other government agencies in response to developments in the banking sector had been effective in largely reducing stress. They noted that conditions in the banking sector had broadly im- proved since early March, with the initial deposit out- flows experienced by some regional and smaller banks moderating substantially over subsequent weeks. Many participants commented that the recent developments in the banking sector had contributed to some tighten- ing of lending standards beyond that which had oc- curred during previous quarters, especially among small and mid-sized banks. Some participants noted that small businesses tend to rely on small and mid-sized banks as primary sources of credit and therefore may disproportionally bear the effects of tighter lending conditions. Some participants mentioned that access to credit had not yet appeared to have declined signifi- cantly since the recent onset of stress in the banking sector. Participants judged that stress in the banking sector would, in coming quarters, likely induce banks to tighten lending standards by more than they would have in response to higher interest rates alone. However, participants generally noted that it was too early to as- sess with confidence the magnitude and persistence of these effects on economic activity. In their discussion of the household sector, participants noted that consumer spending showed strength in the first quarter, supported by gains in personal disposable income. They also remarked that the quarterly strength was driven mainly by very strong spending growth in January, while real spending fell modestly over February and March. Consistent with that slowing, participants anticipated that consumer spending would likely grow at a subdued rate over the remainder of 2023, reflecting in large part the effects of the tightening in financial conditions over the past year. Participants remarked that higher interest rates would continue to restrain in- terest-sensitive expenditures by households, such as those on housing and durable goods. Participants also noted that the rise in uncertainty associated with recent developments in the banking sector could weigh on consumer sentiment and spending. However, several participants observed that high-frequency measures of consumer sentiment had not yet shown significant changes following the banking-sector developments. A few participants remarked that there had been some on- going reduction in consumers’ discretionary expendi- tures in the face of elevated inflation and higher bor- rowing rates, especially among lower- and middle-in- come households; some of those declines were report- edly driven by shifts in purchases toward lower-cost op- tions. Regarding the business sector, participants observed that growth in business fixed investment was subdued in the first quarter, reflecting relatively high borrowing costs, weak growth of business-sector output, and busi- nesses’ increasing concerns about the general economic outlook. Participants expected the tightening of bank lending standards to weigh further on firms’ capital ex- penditures. Several participants noted that, based on reports from their District contacts, concerns related to banking-sector stress could add more uncertainty to an already soft economic outlook, increasing firms’ cau- tion, especially at smaller and mid-sized firms that rely heavily on bank credit to finance their operations. However, some other participants mentioned that de- velopments in the banking sector appeared to have had only a modest effect so far on credit availability for firms. Participants noted that the labor market remained very tight, with robust payroll gains in March and an unem- ployment rate near historically low levels. Nevertheless, they noted some signs that the imbalance of supply and demand in the labor market was easing, with prime-age labor force participation returning to its pre-pandemic level and further reductions in the rates of job openings and quits. In addition, some participants noted that their District contacts reported less difficulty in hiring, lower turnover rates, and some layoffs. Participants an- ticipated that employment growth would likely slow further, reflecting a moderation in aggregate demand coming partly from tighter credit conditions. Partici- pants remarked that although nominal wage growth ap- peared to be slowing gradually, it was still running at a pace that, given current estimates of trend productivity growth, was well above what would be consistent over Page 8 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ the longer run with the Committee’s 2 percent inflation objective. Participants generally anticipated that under appropriate monetary policy, imbalances in the labor market would gradually diminish, easing pressures on wages and prices. Participants agreed that inflation was unacceptably high. They commented that data through March indi- cated that declines in inflation, particularly for measures of core inflation, had been slower than they had ex- pected. Participants observed that although core goods inflation had moderated since the middle of last year, it had decelerated less rapidly than expected in recent months, despite reports from several business contacts of supply chain constraints continuing to ease. Addi- tionally, participants emphasized that core nonhousing services inflation had shown few signs of slowing in the past few months. Some participants remarked that a further easing in labor market conditions would be needed to help bring down inflation in this component. Regarding housing services inflation, participants ob- served that soft readings on rents for leases signed by new tenants were starting to feed into measured infla- tion. They expected that this process would continue and would help lead to a decline in housing services in- flation over this year. In discussing the likely effects on inflation of recent banking-sector developments, sev- eral participants remarked that tighter credit conditions may not put much downward pressure on inflation in part because lower credit availability could restrain ag- gregate supply as well as aggregate demand. Several participants noted that longer-term measures of infla- tion expectations from surveys of households and busi- nesses remained well anchored. Participants empha- sized that with appropriate firming of monetary policy, well-anchored longer-term inflation expectations would support a return of inflation to the Committee’s 2 per- cent longer-run goal. Participants noted that risks associated with the recent banking stress had led them to raise their already high assessment of uncertainty around their economic out- looks. Participants judged that risks to the outlook for economic activity were weighted to the downside, al- though a few noted the risks were two sided. In dis- cussing sources of downside risk to economic activity, participants referenced the possibility that the cumula- tive tightening of monetary policy could affect eco- nomic activity more than expected, and that further strains in the banking sector could prove more substan- tial than anticipated. Some participants also noted con- cerns that the statutory limit on federal debt might not be raised in a timely manner, threatening significant dis- ruptions to the financial system and tighter financial conditions that weaken the economy. Regarding risks to inflation, participants cited the possibility that price pressures could prove more persistent than anticipated because of, for example, stronger-than-expected con- sumer spending and a tight labor market, especially if the effect of bank stress on economic activity proved modest. However, a few participants cited the possibil- ity that further tightening of credit conditions could slow household spending and reduce business invest- ment and hiring, all of which would support the ongo- ing rebalancing of supply and demand in product and labor markets and reduce inflation pressures. In their discussion of financial stability, various partici- pants commented on recent developments in the bank- ing sector. These participants noted that the banking system was sound and resilient, that actions taken by the Federal Reserve in coordination with other govern- ment agencies had served to calm conditions in that sec- tor, but that stresses remained. A number of partici- pants noted that the banking sector was well capitalized overall, and that the most significant issues in the bank- ing system appeared to be limited to a small number of banks with poor risk-management practices or substan- tial exposure to specific vulnerabilities. These vulnera- bilities included significant unrealized losses on assets resulting from rising interest rates, heavy reliance on un- insured deposits, or strained profitability amid higher funding costs. Some participants additionally noted that, because of weak fundamentals for CRE such as high vacancy rates in the office segment, high exposure to such assets was a vulnerability for some banks. Par- ticipants also commented on the susceptibility of some nonbank financial institutions to runs or instability. These included money market funds, which had re- cently experienced large cash inflows; hedge funds, which tend to use substantial leverage and may hold concentrated positions in some assets with low or zero margin; thinly capitalized nonbank mortgage servicers; and digital asset entities. Many participants mentioned that it is essential that the debt limit be raised in a timely manner to avoid the risk of severely adverse disloca- tions in the financial system and the broader economy. A few participants noted the importance of orderly functioning of the market for U.S. Treasury securities or stressed the importance of the appropriate authori- ties continuing to address issues related to the resilience of the market. A number of participants emphasized that the Federal Reserve should maintain readiness to use its liquidity tools, as well as its microprudential and Minutes of the Meeting of May 2–3, 2023 Page 9 _____________________________________________________________________________________________ macroprudential regulatory and supervisory tools, to mitigate future financial stability risks. In their consideration of appropriate monetary policy actions at this meeting, participants concurred that in- flation remained substantially elevated relative to the Committee’s longer-run goal of 2 percent. Economic activity had expanded at a modest pace in the first quar- ter. The labor market continued to be tight, with robust job gains in recent months, and the unemployment rate remained low. Participants also noted that recent de- velopments in the banking sector would likely result in tighter credit conditions for households and businesses, which would weigh on economic activity, hiring, and inflation. However, the extent of these effects re- mained uncertain. Against this backdrop, all partici- pants agreed that it was appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate 25 basis points to 5 per- cent to 5¼ percent. All participants agreed that it was also appropriate to continue the process of reducing the Federal Reserve’s securities holdings, as described in its previously announced Plans for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve’s Balance Sheet. In discussing the policy outlook, participants generally agreed that in light of the lagged effects of cumulative tightening in monetary policy and the potential effects on the economy of a further tightening in credit condi- tions, the extent to which additional increases in the tar- get range may be appropriate after this meeting had be- come less certain. Participants agreed that it would be important to closely monitor incoming information and assess the implications for monetary policy. In deter- mining the extent to which additional policy firming may be appropriate to return inflation to 2 percent over time, various participants noted specific factors that should bear on future decisions on policy actions. One such factor was the degree and timing with which cu- mulative policy tightening restrained economic activity and reduced inflation, with some participants com- menting that they saw evidence that the past years’ tightening was beginning to have its intended effect. Another factor was the degree to which tighter credit conditions for households and businesses resulting from events in the banking sector would weigh on ac- tivity and reduce inflation, which participants agreed was very uncertain. Additional factors included the progress toward returning inflation to the Committee’s longer-run goal of 2 percent, and the pace at which la- bor market conditions softened and economic growth slowed. Participants also discussed several risk-management considerations that could bear on future policy deci- sions. A few assessed that there were upside risks to economic growth. However, almost all participants commented that downside risks to growth and upside risks to unemployment had increased because of the possibility that banking-sector developments could lead to further tightening of credit conditions and weigh on economic activity. Almost all participants stated that, with inflation still well above the Committee’s longer- run goal and the labor market remaining tight, upside risks to the inflation outlook remained a key factor shaping the policy outlook. A few participants noted that they also saw some downside risks to inflation. Taking into account these various considerations, par- ticipants discussed their views on the extent to which further policy firming after the current meeting may be appropriate. Participants generally expressed uncer- tainty about how much more policy tightening may be appropriate. Many participants focused on the need to retain optionality after this meeting. Some participants commented that, based on their expectations that pro- gress in returning inflation to 2 percent could continue to be unacceptably slow, additional policy firming would likely be warranted at future meetings. Several participants noted that if the economy evolved along the lines of their current outlooks, then further policy firming after this meeting may not be necessary. In light of the prominent risks to the Committee’s objec- tives with respect to both maximum employment and price stability, participants generally noted the im- portance of closely monitoring incoming information and its implications for the economic outlook. Participants discussed the importance and various as- pects of clearly explaining monetary policy actions and strategy. All participants reaffirmed their strong com- mitment to returning inflation to the Committee’s 2 percent objective over time and remained highly at- tentive to inflation risks. A few participants com- mented that recent monetary policy actions and com- munications had helped keep inflation expectations well anchored, which they saw as important for the attain- ment of the Committee’s goals. Participants empha- sized the importance of communicating to the public the data-dependent approach of policymakers, and the vast majority of participants commented that the ad- justed language in the postmeeting statement was help- ful in that respect. Some participants stressed that it was crucial to communicate that the language in the postmeeting statement should not be interpreted as sig- naling either that decreases in the target range are likely Page 10 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ this year or that further increases in the target range had been ruled out. Committee Policy Actions In their discussion of monetary policy for this meeting, members agreed that economic activity had expanded at a modest pace in the first quarter. They also con- curred that job gains had been robust in recent months, and the unemployment rate had remained low. Infla- tion had remained elevated. Members concurred that the U.S. banking system was sound and resilient. They also agreed that tighter credit conditions for households and businesses were likely to weigh on economic activity, hiring, and inflation, but that the extent of these effects was uncertain. Members also concurred that they remained highly attentive to in- flation risks. Members agreed that the Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. In support of these goals, the members agreed to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 5 to 5¼ percent. Members agreed to closely monitor incoming information and as- sess the implications for monetary policy. In determin- ing the extent to which additional policy firming may be appropriate to return inflation to 2 percent over time, members concurred that they will take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and in- flation, and economic and financial developments. In addition, members agreed that they will continue reduc- ing the Federal Reserve’s holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securi- ties, as described in its previously announced plans. All members affirmed that they are strongly committed to returning inflation to their 2 percent objective. Members agreed that, in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, they would continue to mon- itor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. They would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Com- mittee’s goals. Members also agreed that their assess- ments will take into account a wide range of infor- mation, including readings on labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and fi- nancial and international developments. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Open Market Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive, for release at 2:00 p.m.: “Effective May 4, 2023, the Federal Open Market Committee directs the Desk to: • Undertake open market operations as nec- essary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of 5 to 5¼ percent. • Conduct standing overnight repurchase agreement operations with a minimum bid rate of 5.25 percent and with an aggregate operation limit of $500 billion. • Conduct standing overnight reverse repur- chase agreement operations at an offering rate of 5.05 percent and with a per-coun- terparty limit of $160 billion per day. • Roll over at auction the amount of princi- pal payments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of Treasury securities maturing in each calendar month that exceeds a cap of $60 billion per month. Redeem Treasury coupon securities up to this monthly cap and Treasury bills to the extent that cou- pon principal payments are less than the monthly cap. • Reinvest into agency mortgage-backed se- curities (MBS) the amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s hold- ings of agency debt and agency MBS re- ceived in each calendar month that exceeds a cap of $35 billion per month. • Allow modest deviations from stated amounts for reinvestments, if needed for operational reasons. • Engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settle- ment of the Federal Reserve’s agency MBS transactions.” The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below for release at 2:00 p.m.: “Economic activity expanded at a modest pace in the first quarter. Job gains have been robust in recent months, and the unemployment rate has remained low. Inflation remains elevated. The U.S. banking system is sound and resilient. Tighter credit conditions for households and Minutes of the Meeting of May 2–3, 2023 Page 11 _____________________________________________________________________________________________ businesses are likely to weigh on economic ac- tivity, hiring, and inflation. The extent of these effects remains uncertain. The Committee re- mains highly attentive to inflation risks. The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 per- cent over the longer run. In support of these goals, the Committee decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 5 to 5¼ per- cent. The Committee will closely monitor in- coming information and assess the implica- tions for monetary policy. In determining the extent to which additional policy firming may be appropriate to return inflation to 2 percent over time, the Committee will take into ac- count the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy af- fects economic activity and inflation, and eco- nomic and financial developments. In addi- tion, the Committee will continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities, as de- scribed in its previously announced plans. The Committee is strongly committed to returning inflation to its 2 percent objective. In assessing the appropriate stance of mone- tary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming infor- mation for the economic outlook. The Com- mittee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals. The Committee’s assess- ments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on labor mar- ket conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.” Voting for this action: Jerome H.

Page 2 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Developments in Financial Markets and Open Market Operations The manager turned first to a review of developments in financial markets. Policy-sensitive rates increased over the intermeeting period, reflecting indications of contin- ued resilience in the economy, persistently elevated core inflation, and reduced downside tail risks following the resolution of the debt limit. The shift in policy expecta- tions contributed significantly to higher Treasury yields. The increase in nominal yields primarily reflected higher real rates rather than inflation compensation. Broad eq- uity prices rose, although the outperformance was con- centrated in a handful of companies with a large market capitalization. Cyclical sectors fared better than sectors that tend to appreciate in a downturn, suggesting some reduced investor concern about downside risks to growth. Investor sentiment about the banking sector improved as perceived tail risks regarding regional banks appeared to have receded. Equity prices for regional banks rose over the intermeeting period but were still well below early March levels. Financial conditions in- dexes were roughly unchanged, as higher rates and a stronger dollar were offset by higher equity prices and narrower credit spreads. The vast majority of respondents to the Open Market Desk’s Surveys of Primary Dealers and Market Partici- pants expected no rate change at this meeting. While the median path from the surveys pointed to no rate changes through early 2024, there was significant dispersion across respondents, and respondents saw a clear proba- bility of additional tightening at coming meetings. Re- spondents’ average probability distribution for the level of the peak policy rate shifted higher since the May meet- ing and respondents on average assigned about 60 per- cent probability to the peak being above the current tar- get range. The market-implied path for the policy rate continued to show some decline this year but less so than it had in recent months. Measures of uncertainty about the path of the policy rate derived from options remained very elevated, though they came down some over the intermeeting period. Desk survey respondents still saw a recession occurring in the near term as quite likely, but the expected timing was again pushed later, as economic data pointed to the continued resilience of economic activity. Overall, re- spondents generally continued to expect that any down- turn would be neither deep nor prolonged. With regard to inflation expectations, respondents marked up their projections for quarterly core personal consumption ex- penditures (PCE) inflation in the second and third quar- ters of this year, while projections for later quarters were little changed. The manager then turned to money market develop- ments and policy implementation. The median respond- ent to the Desk surveys expected the three-month bill yield to increase slightly relative to the similar-maturity overnight index swap (OIS) rate and to remain above it into the fourth quarter. This expectation likely reflected a combination of rising net supply of bills as part of the Treasury Department’s plan to rebuild the Treasury General Account (TGA) following the resolution of the debt limit and expectations for healthy investor demand for bills. The overnight reverse repurchase agreement (ON RRP) facility, which continued to support effective policy implementation and control over the federal funds rate, saw somewhat lower participation since the resolution of the debt limit, consistent with the historical experience that ON RRP participation is typically re- sponsive to changes in money market conditions. The median respondent to the Desk’s Survey of Primary Dealers expected ON RRP participation to trend lower over the rest of this year. The staff assessed that the replenishment of the TGA and the ongoing balance sheet runoff, among other factors, were likely to subtract from reserves more than the decline in ON RRP partic- ipation would add to them. On net, the staff judged that reserves at the end of the year were likely to remain abundant. Uncertainty surrounding the outlooks for both reserves and ON RRP participation was substan- tial. By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk’s domestic transactions over the intermeeting period. There were no intervention operations in foreign curren- cies for the System’s account during the intermeeting pe- riod. Staff Review of the Economic Situation The information available at the time of the June 13–14 meeting suggested that real gross domestic product (GDP) was expanding at a modest pace in the second quarter. Labor market conditions remained tight in re- cent months, as job gains were robust and the unem- ployment rate was low. Consumer price inflation—as measured by the 12-month percent change in the price index for PCE—continued to be elevated in April. Labor market conditions remained tight in April and May. Total nonfarm payroll employment increased at a robust pace during those two months. The unemploy- ment rate edged up, on net, but was still at a low level of 3.7 percent in May. On balance, the unemployment rate Minutes of the Meeting of June 13–14, 2023 Page 3 _____________________________________________________________________________________________ for African Americans moved up to 5.6 percent, while the jobless rate for Hispanics moved down to 4.0 per- cent. In aggregate, the labor force participation rate held steady in April and May, and the employment-to- population ratio ticked down. The private-sector job openings rate in April—as measured by the Job Open- ings and Labor Turnover Survey—was unchanged from its relatively high first-quarter average, though it was lower than a year earlier. Recent measures of nominal wage growth continued to be elevated, although lower than their highs last year. Over the 12 months ending in May, average hourly earn- ings for all employees increased 4.3 percent, below its peak of 5.9 percent early last year. Over the year ending in the first quarter, compensation per hour in the busi- ness sector increased 3.2 percent, down from 5.5 percent a year earlier. Consumer price inflation remained elevated. Total PCE price inflation had eased since the middle of last year, reflecting declines in consumer energy prices and soften- ing consumer food price inflation, but recent readings for core PCE price inflation—which excludes changes in consumer energy prices and most consumer food prices and usually provides a better signal about future inflation than the more volatile total inflation measure— were little changed. Total PCE price inflation was 4.4 percent over the 12 months ending in April, and core PCE price inflation was 4.7 percent—the same as the 12-month percent change recorded in January. In May, the 12-month change in the consumer price index (CPI) was 4.0 percent, and core CPI inflation was 5.3 per- cent—only slightly below its January reading. The trimmed mean measure of 12-month PCE price infla- tion constructed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas was 4.8 percent in April. Survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations in May from the Uni- versity of Michigan Surveys of Consumers and the Fed- eral Reserve Bank of New York’s Survey of Consumer Expectations remained within the range of their values reported in the decade before the pandemic; near-term measures of inflation expectations from these surveys moved down in May and continued to be below their peaks seen last year. Real GDP appeared to be increasing modestly in the sec- ond quarter following its stronger first-quarter gain. Pri- vate domestic final purchases (PDFP)—which includes PCE, residential investment, and business fixed invest- ment and often provides a better signal of underlying economic momentum than GDP—looked to be ex- panding more slowly in the second quarter than its ro- bust first-quarter pace. For the first half as a whole, PDFP growth seemed to be more resilient than in the second half of last year. The annual revisions to international trade statistics sug- gested that net exports contributed positively to U.S. real GDP growth in the first quarter, with real exports re- bounding more strongly than real imports following their fourth-quarter declines. In April, however, the nominal trade deficit widened notably, as nominal ex- ports decreased and nominal imports rose further. Foreign economic growth rebounded in the first quarter, reflecting in part the reopening of China’s economy from its COVID-19-related shutdowns and strong services-sector activity in other Asian countries, Canada, and Mexico. In the euro area, however, real GDP con- tracted modestly for a second consecutive quarter amid a pullback in consumer spending. Indicators pointed to a step-down in the pace of foreign economic growth in the second quarter, with the impetus from China’s reo- pening dissipating and global manufacturing activity re- maining weak. Global prices for energy and agricultural commodities were little changed, on net, over the intermeeting period, while prices for metals fell further. Declines in retail en- ergy prices since the beginning of the year contributed to a notable easing in headline consumer price inflation in the foreign economies. By contrast, core inflation had yet to materially decline from its recent highs in many economies. In this context, and with tight labor market conditions, foreign central banks underscored the need to raise policy rates further or hold them at sufficiently restrictive levels to bring inflation back to their respec- tive targets and be well positioned in case inflation failed to decline as expected. Staff Review of the Financial Situation Over the intermeeting period, market participants ap- peared to interpret incoming data as signaling, on bal- ance, more resilience in economic activity than previ- ously assumed and viewed communications from FOMC participants overall as pointing to a tighter path for policy than expected. As a result, Treasury yields and the expected future path for the federal funds rate shifted upward significantly. Meanwhile, broad equity prices also increased notably. Financing conditions re- mained moderately restrictive, but credit availability gen- erally remained solid. The expected path of the policy rate implied by market quotes moved up notably over the intermeeting period. Page 4 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ A straight read of federal funds futures rates suggested that market participants expected that the federal funds rate would be roughly flat over the course of the rest of this year. The year-end expected rate was about 70 basis points higher than the year-end expectation before the May FOMC meeting. Beyond this year, the policy rate path implied by OIS quotes also moved up, to about 3.7 percent by the end of 2024. Similarly, nominal Treasury yields rose significantly. The rise in nominal yields mostly reflected an increase in real yields, as measures of inflation compensation were little changed, on net, amid somewhat mixed news on inflation. Measures of uncertainty about the path of interest rates remained very elevated by historical standards. The S&P 500 stock price index increased sizably, on net, over the intermeeting period, led by technology-related stocks. The VIX—the one-month option-implied vola- tility on the S&P 500 index—edged down, on balance, and ended the period near the 30th percentile of its his- torical distribution. Bank equity price indexes moved up notably, on net, over the intermeeting period. Stock prices for large banks were only somewhat below their levels before the failure of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), while those for regional banks remained below their lev- els in early March. Market-based policy rate expectations rose notably in most advanced foreign economies, as core inflation data surprised to the upside in some countries and central bank communications were perceived as pointing to more restrictive policy than expected. Notwithstanding the rise in global yields, foreign equity prices, credit spreads, and risk sentiment in foreign markets were little changed over the intermeeting period. The staff’s trade- weighted broad dollar index was also little changed, on net, but the exchange value of the dollar appreciated sig- nificantly against the Chinese renminbi amid increased investor concerns over China’s economic growth pro- spects. Conditions in overnight bank funding and repurchase agreement markets remained generally stable over the in- termeeting period. The 25 basis point increase in admin- istered rates at the May FOMC meeting fully passed through to overnight money market rates. Spreads and issuance volumes in unsecured short-term funding mar- kets stayed within their typical ranges. In May, yields of Treasury bills maturing in June and thus potentially af- fected by the federal debt limit rose sharply before largely retracing those increases after an agreement was reached to suspend the debt limit. In domestic credit markets, borrowing costs for busi- nesses, households, and municipalities increased notably over the intermeeting period. Interest rates on newly originated bank loans to businesses and households in the first quarter rose further above their peaks from the previous tightening cycle, and yields on leveraged loans also rose, reaching levels close to their peak at the onset of the pandemic. Rates also moved up on a broad array of fixed-income securities, including investment- and speculative-grade corporate bonds, municipal bonds, both agency and non-agency commercial mortgage- backed securities (CMBS), and agency residential mortgage-backed securities. The increases in yields on these instruments over the intermeeting period were generally in line with, or less than, the changes in their Treasury benchmarks. Small businesses and households saw continued increases in their borrowing costs. Rates on 30-year conforming residential mortgages stepped up, broadly in line with increases in comparable-duration Treasury yields. Interest rates on credit card offers con- tinued to rise through April, and auto loan interest rates moved sideways during the intermeeting period. Both credit card and auto loan interest rates stood at, or near, their highest levels since the Global Financial Crisis. Banks’ ability to fund loans to businesses and consumers appeared to have stabilized in recent weeks but remained somewhat strained relative to before the closure of SVB in March. Although banks continued to experience out- flows of core deposits, the pace of those outflows mod- erated substantially relative to March, suggesting some easing of bank funding pressures. Banks also continued to attract inflows of large time deposits, reflecting higher interest rates on new certificates of deposit. Total bank assets were little changed, on net, over the intermeeting period. In capital markets, funding had generally been resilient. Issuance of nonfinancial investment-grade corporate bonds rose at a robust pace in May after slowing in April, partly due to the “earnings blackout” period. Specula- tive-grade issuance increased in late April and in May but remained subdued by historical standards. Gross issu- ance of municipal bonds was solid in April and May. Conditions in the leveraged loan and CMBS markets were somewhat more strained. Leveraged loan issuance remained subdued, reflecting weak investor demand amid concerns over the credit worthiness of borrowers. Both agency and non-agency CMBS issuance volumes were low in May relative to pre-pandemic levels. In ad- dition, for small businesses, credit availability continued to show signs of tightening. Minutes of the Meeting of June 13–14, 2023 Page 5 _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Credit remained easily available in the residential mort- gage market for high credit score borrowers who met standard conforming loan criteria. For borrowers with lower scores, credit availability tightened slightly in April but remained close to pre-pandemic levels. In consumer credit markets, conditions stayed generally accommoda- tive, with credit available for most borrowers. The credit quality of most businesses and households re- mained solid, although market participants appeared to expect some deterioration in the coming quarters, which could weaken lender balance sheets and possibly weigh on credit availability. A measure of the May CMBS de- linquency rate showed about a 50 basis point increase, driven by a sharp rise in the delinquency rate for office buildings. Staff Economic Outlook The economic forecast prepared by the staff for the June FOMC meeting continued to assume that the effects of the expected further tightening in bank credit condi- tions, amid already tight financial conditions, would lead to a mild recession starting later this year, followed by a moderately paced recovery. Real GDP was projected to decelerate in the current quarter and the next one before declining modestly in both the fourth quarter of this year and first quarter of next year. Real GDP growth over 2024 and 2025 was projected to be below the staff’s es- timate of potential output growth. The unemployment rate was forecast to increase this year, peak next year, and remain near that level through 2025. Current tight resource utilization in both product and labor markets was forecast to ease, with the level of real output moving below the staff’s estimate of potential output in 2025 and the unemployment rate rising above the staff’s estimate of its natural rate at that time. The staff’s inflation forecast was little revised relative to the previous projection, and supply–demand imbalances in both goods markets and labor markets were still judged to be easing only slowly. On a four-quarter change basis, total PCE price inflation was projected to be 3.0 percent this year, with core inflation at 3.7 per- cent. Core goods inflation was forecast to move down further this year and then remain subdued. Housing ser- vices inflation was considered to have about peaked and was expected to move down over the rest of the year. Core nonhousing services inflation was projected to slow gradually as nominal wage growth eased further. Reflecting the effects of the easing in resource utilization over the projection, core inflation was forecast to slow through next year but remain moderately above 2 per- cent. With expected declines in consumer energy prices and further moderation in food price inflation, total in- flation was projected to run below core inflation this year and the next. In 2025, both total and core PCE price inflation were expected to be close to 2 percent. The staff continued to judge that uncertainty around the baseline projection was considerable and still viewed the risks as being influenced importantly by the potential macroeconomic implications of banking-sector develop- ments, which could end up being more, or less, negative than assumed in the baseline. Given the continued strength in labor market conditions and the resilience of consumer spending, however, the staff saw the possibil- ity of the economy continuing to grow slowly and avoid- ing a downturn as almost as likely as the mild-recession baseline. On balance, the staff saw the risks around the baseline inflation forecast as tilted to the upside, as eco- nomic scenarios with higher inflation appeared more likely than scenarios with lower inflation and because in- flation could continue to be more persistent than ex- pected and inflation expectations could become unan- chored after a long period of elevated inflation. Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, participants submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and infla- tion for each year from 2023 through 2025 and over the longer run. The projections were based on their individ- ual assessments of appropriate monetary policy, includ- ing the path of the federal funds rate. The longer-run projections represented each participant’s assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy. A Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) was released to the public following the conclusion of the meeting. In their discussion of current economic conditions, par- ticipants noted that economic activity had continued to expand at a modest pace. Nonetheless, job gains had been robust in recent months, and the unemployment rate had remained low. Inflation remained elevated. Participants agreed that the U.S. banking system was sound and resilient. They commented that tighter credit conditions for households and businesses were likely to weigh on economic activity, hiring, and inflation. How- ever, participants agreed that the extent of these effects remained uncertain. Against this background, partici- pants concurred that they remained highly attentive to inflation risks. Page 6 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ In assessing the economic outlook, most participants noted that real GDP growth had been resilient in recent quarters. Participants generally judged that growth would be subdued over the remainder of this year. They assessed that the cumulative tightening of monetary pol- icy over the past year had contributed significantly to more restrictive financial conditions and lower demand in the most interest rate sensitive sectors of the econ- omy, especially housing and business investment. Par- ticipants also acknowledged uncertainty about the lags with which monetary policy affects the economy and discussed the extent to which the full effects of mone- tary tightening on the economy had been realized. While total inflation had moderated over the past year, core in- flation had not shown a sustained easing since the begin- ning of the year. With inflation well above the Commit- tee’s longer-run 2 percent objective, participants ex- pected that a period of below-trend growth in real GDP and some softening in labor market conditions would be needed to bring aggregate supply and aggregate demand into better balance and reduce inflationary pressures suf- ficiently to return inflation to 2 percent over time. Participants generally noted that banking stresses had re- ceded and conditions in the banking sector were much improved since early March. Participants generally con- tinued to judge that a tightening in credit conditions spurred by banking-sector stress earlier in the year would likely weigh further on economic activity, but the extent remained uncertain. Several participants mentioned that credit conditions had not appeared to have tightened sig- nificantly beyond what would be expected in response to the monetary policy actions taken since early last year. Some participants judged that it was still too early to as- sess with confidence the eventual effects of tighter bank credit conditions on economic activity and noted that it would be important to monitor closely the potential ef- fects of banking-sector developments on credit condi- tions and economic activity. In their discussion of the household sector, participants generally noted that consumer spending so far this year had been stronger than expected. Several participants noted that aggregate household wealth remained high, as equity and home prices had not declined much from their recent highs. A few participants mentioned that while, overall, the household sector still retained much of the excess savings it had accumulated during the pan- demic, there were signs that consumers were facing in- creasingly tighter budget constraints, given high inflation and, especially for low-income households, depleted sav- ings. Regarding the business sector, various participants said that reports from their contacts were mixed, with some pointing to softening economic conditions and others indicating greater-than-expected strength. Many partic- ipants noted that developments in the banking sector ap- peared to have had only a modest effect so far on credit availability for firms. Some participants remarked that the effect of high interest rates on the housing sector ap- peared to be bottoming out, with home sales, builder sentiment, and new construction all having improved a little since the start of the year. In their discussion of economic activity, several partici- pants pointed out that recent GDP readings had been stronger than expected earlier in the year, while gross domestic income (GDI) readings had been weak. Of those who noted the discrepancy between GDP and GDI, most suggested that economic momentum may not be as strong as indicated by the GDP readings. In discussing that possibility, a couple of these participants also cited the recent subdued growth in aggregate hours worked. Participants noted that labor market conditions re- mained very tight, with robust payroll gains and the un- employment rate still near historically low levels. Nev- ertheless, they noted some signs that supply and demand in the labor market were coming into better balance, with the prime-age labor force participation rate moving up in recent months and further reductions in rates of job openings and quits, and declines in average weekly hours. A couple of participants conveyed that they heard at a recent Fed Listens event that, in various parts of the country, the lack of affordable housing in the area was preventing some lower-income workers from relo- cating to accept jobs. Similarly, a few participants noted that their District contacts reported less difficulty in hir- ing and retaining workers, lower turnover rates, and some layoffs. Some participants pointed out that payroll gains had remained robust but noted that some other measures of employment—such as those based on the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ household survey, the Quar- terly Census of Employment and Wages, or the Board staff’s measure of private employment using data from the payroll processing firm ADP—suggested that job growth may have been weaker than indicated by payroll employment. Participants anticipated that employment growth would likely slow further, consistent with their projections of below-trend economic growth. Partici- pants noted that nominal wage growth had shown signs of easing but observed that it was still running at a pace that, given current estimates of trend productivity growth, was above what would be consistent over the Minutes of the Meeting of June 13–14, 2023 Page 7 _____________________________________________________________________________________________ longer run with the Committee’s 2 percent inflation ob- jective. Participants expected supply and demand con- ditions in the labor market to come into better balance over time, easing pressures on wages and prices. Participants agreed that inflation was unacceptably high and noted that the data, including the CPI for May, indi- cated that declines in inflation had been slower than they had expected. Participants observed that although core goods inflation had moderated since the middle of last year, it had slowed less rapidly than expected in recent months, despite data and reports from business contacts indicating that supply chain constraints had continued to ease. Some participants noted the recent moderation in housing services inflation and expected this trend to continue. However, a few participants pointed to upside risks to the outlook for housing services inflation asso- ciated with near-record low inventories of homes for sale, solid housing demand, and less-than-expected de- celeration recently in measures of rents for leases signed by new tenants. Additionally, some participants re- marked that core nonhousing services inflation had shown few signs of slowing in the past few months. Sev- eral participants noted that longer-term measures of in- flation expectations from surveys of households and businesses remained well anchored. Participants empha- sized that, with appropriate firming of monetary policy, well-anchored longer-term inflation expectations would support a return of inflation to the Committee’s 2 per- cent longer-run goal over time. Participants generally noted a high degree of uncertainty regarding the cumulative effects on the economy from both already-enacted monetary policy tightening and the potential additional tightening in credit conditions stem- ming from recent banking-sector developments. Partic- ipants noted that the full effects of monetary tightening had likely yet to be observed, though several highlighted the possibility that much of the effect of past monetary policy tightening may have already been realized. Re- garding downside risks to economic activity, participants noted the possibility that the cumulative and rapid tight- ening of monetary policy would eventually affect eco- nomic activity more than expected, and that the addi- tional effects of the tightening of bank credit conditions could prove more substantial than anticipated. Regard- ing risks to inflation, with inflation remaining well above the Committee’s longer-run goal, some participants mentioned the possibility that longer-term inflation ex- pectations could become unanchored, particularly in light of stronger-than-expected consumer demand and a still-tight labor market. Several participants cited the possibility of delayed effects of tighter credit conditions potentially contributing to a slowdown in economic ac- tivity that reduces inflationary pressures. In their consideration of appropriate monetary policy ac- tions at this meeting, participants concurred that while inflation had moderated since the middle of 2022, it re- mained well above the Committee’s longer-run goal of 2 percent. Economic activity had continued to expand at a modest pace. The labor market remained very tight, with robust job gains in recent months and the unem- ployment rate still low, but there were some signs that supply and demand in the labor market were coming into better balance. The economy was facing headwinds from tighter credit conditions, including higher interest rates, for households and businesses, which would likely weigh on economic activity, hiring, and inflation, al- though the extent of these effect remained uncertain. Against this backdrop, and in consideration of the sig- nificant cumulative tightening in the stance of monetary policy and the lags with which policy affects economic activity and inflation, almost all participants judged it ap- propriate or acceptable to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 5 to 5¼ percent at this meeting. Most of these participants observed that leaving the tar- get range unchanged at this meeting would allow them more time to assess the economy’s progress toward the Committee’s goals of maximum employment and price stability. Some participants indicated that they favored raising the target range for the federal funds rate 25 basis points at this meeting or that they could have supported such a proposal. The participants favoring a 25 basis point increase noted that the labor market remained very tight, momentum in economic activity had been stronger than earlier anticipated, and there were few clear signs that inflation was on a path to return to the Committee’s 2 percent objective over time. All participants agreed that it was appropriate to continue the process of reduc- ing the Federal Reserve’s securities holdings, as de- scribed in its previously announced Plans for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve’s Balance Sheet. In discussing the policy outlook, all participants contin- ued to anticipate that, with inflation still well above the Committee’s 2 percent goal and the labor market re- maining very tight, maintaining a restrictive stance for monetary policy would be appropriate to achieve the Committee’s objectives. Almost all participants noted that in their economic projections that they judged that additional increases in the target federal funds rate dur- ing 2023 would be appropriate. Most participants ob- served that uncertainty about the outlook for the econ- omy and inflation remained elevated and that additional Page 8 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ information would be valuable for considering the ap- propriate stance of monetary policy. Many also noted that, after rapidly tightening the stance of monetary pol- icy last year, the Committee had slowed the pace of tight- ening and that a further moderation in the pace of policy firming was appropriate in order to provide additional time to observe the effects of cumulative tightening and assess their implications for policy. Participants agreed that their policy decisions at every meeting would con- tinue to be based on the totality of incoming information and its implications for the economic outlook as well as the balance of risks. They also emphasized the im- portance of communicating to the public their data- dependent approach. Most participants observed that postmeeting communications, including the SEP, would help clarify their assessment regarding the stance of monetary policy that is likely to be appropriate to bring inflation down to 2 percent over time. Participants also discussed several risk-management considerations that could bear on future policy deci- sions. Almost all participants stated that, with inflation still well above the Committee’s longer-run goal and the labor market remaining tight, upside risks to the inflation outlook or the possibility that persistently high inflation might cause inflation expectations to become unan- chored remained key factors shaping the policy outlook. Even though economic activity had been resilient re- cently and that the labor market remained strong, some participants commented that there continued to be downside risks to economic growth and upside risks to unemployment. Despite the receding of the stresses in the banking sector, some participants commented that it would be important to monitor whether developments in the banking sector lead to further tightening of credit conditions and weigh on economic activity. Some par- ticipants noted concerns about the potential risks stem- ming from weakness in commercial real estate. A number of participants observed that the resolution of the federal government debt limit had removed one source of significant uncertainty for the economic out- look. A few participants noted that there could be some upward pressure on money market rates in the near term as the Treasury issued more bills to meet expenditures and return the balance in the TGA to the Treasury’s pre- ferred level. Those participants observed that upward pressure on money market rates relative to the rate of- fered on the ON RRP facility could lead to a decline in usage of the facility. Committee Policy Actions In their discussion of monetary policy for this meeting, members agreed that economic activity had continued to expand at a modest pace. They also concurred that job gains had been robust in recent months, and the unem- ployment rate had remained low. Inflation had remained elevated. Members concurred that the U.S. banking system was sound and resilient. They also agreed that tighter credit conditions for households and businesses were likely to weigh on economic activity, hiring, and inflation, but that the extent of these effects was uncertain. Members also concurred that they remained highly attentive to in- flation risks. Members agreed that the Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 per- cent over the longer run. In support of these goals, the members agreed to maintain the target range for the fed- eral funds rate at 5 to 5¼ percent. Members agreed that holding the target range steady at this meeting allowed the Committee to assess additional information and its implications for monetary policy. In determining the ex- tent of additional policy firming that may be appropriate to return inflation to 2 percent over time, members con- curred that they will take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which mon- etary policy affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments. In addition, members agreed that the Committee will continue to re- duce the Federal Reserve’s holdings of Treasury securi- ties and agency debt and agency mortgage-backed secu- rities, as described in its previously announced plans. All members affirmed that they are strongly committed to returning inflation to their 2 percent objective. Members agreed that, in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, they would continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. They would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals. Mem- bers also agreed that their assessments will take into ac- count a wide range of information, including readings on labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international develop- ments. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Open Market Account in accordance with the Minutes of the Meeting of June 13–14, 2023 Page 9 _____________________________________________________________________________________________ following domestic policy directive, for release at 2:00 p.m.: “Effective June 15, 2023, the Federal Open Market Committee directs the Desk to: • Undertake open market operations as nec- essary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of 5 to 5¼ percent. • Conduct standing overnight repurchase agreement operations with a minimum bid rate of 5.25 percent and with an aggregate operation limit of $500 billion. • Conduct standing overnight reverse repur- chase agreement operations at an offering rate of 5.05 percent and with a per-counter- party limit of $160 billion per day. • Roll over at auction the amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s hold- ings of Treasury securities maturing in each calendar month that exceeds a cap of $60 billion per month. Redeem Treasury coupon securities up to this monthly cap and Treasury bills to the extent that coupon principal payments are less than the monthly cap. • Reinvest into agency mortgage-backed se- curities (MBS) the amount of principal pay- ments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of agency debt and agency MBS received in each calendar month that exceeds a cap of $35 billion per month. • Allow modest deviations from stated amounts for reinvestments, if needed for operational reasons. • Engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settle- ment of the Federal Reserve’s agency MBS transactions.” The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below for release at 2:00 p.m.: “Recent indicators suggest that economic activ- ity has continued to expand at a modest pace. Job gains have been robust in recent months, and the unemployment rate has remained low. Inflation remains elevated. The U.S. banking system is sound and resilient. Tighter credit conditions for households and businesses are likely to weigh on economic ac- tivity, hiring, and inflation. The extent of these effects remains uncertain. The Committee re- mains highly attentive to inflation risks. The Committee seeks to achieve maximum em- ployment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. In support of these goals, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 5 to 5¼ per- cent. Holding the target range steady at this meeting allows the Committee to assess addi- tional information and its implications for mon- etary policy. In determining the extent of addi- tional policy firming that may be appropriate to return inflation to 2 percent over time, the Committee will take into account the cumula- tive tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial devel- opments. In addition, the Committee will con- tinue reducing its holdings of Treasury securi- ties and agency debt and agency mortgage- backed securities, as described in its previously announced plans. The Committee is strongly committed to returning inflation to its 2 percent objective. In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals. The Committee’s assessments will take into account a wide range of information, in- cluding readings on labor market conditions, in- flation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.” Voting for this action: Jerome H. Powell, John C. Williams, Michael S. Barr, Michelle W. Bowman, Lisa D. Cook, Austan D. Goolsbee, Patrick Harker, Philip N. Jefferson, Neel Kashkari, Lorie K. Logan, and Christopher J. Waller.

Wood, Special Adviser to the Board, Division of Board Members, Board Rebecca Zarutskie, Special Adviser to the Board, Division of Board Members, Board Developments in Financial Markets and Open Market Operations The manager turned first to a review of developments in financial markets over the intermeeting period. Market participants interpreted data releases as generally demonstrating economic resilience and a further easing of inflation pressures. The market-implied peak for the federal funds rate rose in response to data pointing to a robust economy but retraced part of that move after the June consumer price index (CPI) release was interpreted by market participants as softer than anticipated. Even as market prices shifted to indicate a slightly more re- Page 2 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ strictive expected policy path, broader financial condi- tions eased a bit, reflecting in large part gains in equity prices and tighter credit spreads. Notably, share prices for bank equity also appreciated over the intermeeting period as concerns about the banking sector continued to dissipate. Spot and forward measures of inflation compensation based on Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities were little changed over the intermeeting pe- riod at levels broadly consistent with the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term survey- and market-based measures continued to point to inflation expectations being firmly anchored. Market-implied peak policy rates in most advanced foreign economies (AFEs) rose further this period, and the dollar depreci- ated modestly. Respondents to the Open Market Desk’s Survey of Pri- mary Dealers and Survey of Market Participants in July continued to place significant probability of a recession occurring by the end of 2024. However, the timing of a recession expected by survey respondents was again pushed later, and the probability of avoiding a recession through 2024 grew noticeably. Survey respondents an- ticipated that both headline and core personal consump- tion expenditures (PCE) inflation will decline to 2 per- cent by the end of 2025. There was a strong anticipation, evident in both market- based measures and responses to the Desk’s surveys, that the Committee would raise the target range 25 basis points at the July FOMC meeting. Most survey respond- ents had a modal expectation that a July rate hike would be the last of this tightening cycle, although most re- spondents also perceived that additional monetary pol- icy tightening after the July FOMC meeting was possible. As inferred from their responses, survey respondents ex- pected real rates to increase through the first half of 2024 and to remain above their expectations for the long-run neutral levels for a few years. The manager then turned to money market develop- ments and policy implementation. The overnight re- verse repurchase agreement (ON RRP) facility contin- ued to work as intended over the intermeeting period and had been instrumental in providing an effective floor under the federal funds rate and supporting other money market rates; those rates remained stable over the period. Following the suspension of the debt ceiling in early June, the Treasury Department issued securities, notably Treasury bills, to replenish the Treasury General Account (TGA). The resulting greater availability of Treasury bills, which were priced at rates slightly above the current and expected ON RRP rates, induced a net decline in ON RRP balances for the period. A further decline in ON RRP balances was deemed probable amid sustained projected Treasury bill issuance, further reduc- tions in the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet in accordance with the previously announced Plans for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve’s Balance Sheet, and a possible further reduction in policy uncer- tainty that could incentivize money funds to extend the duration of their portfolios. In the July Desk Survey of Primary Dealers, respondents expected lower ON RRP balances and higher bank reserves by the end of the year, compared with the June survey. By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk’s domestic transactions over the intermeeting period. There were no intervention operations in foreign curren- cies for the System’s account during the intermeeting pe- riod. Staff Review of the Economic Situation The information available at the time of the July 25–26 meeting suggested that real gross domestic product (GDP) rose at a moderate pace over the first half of the year. The labor market remained very tight, though the imbalance between demand and supply in the labor mar- ket was gradually diminishing. Consumer price infla- tion—as measured by the 12-month percent change in the price index for PCE—remained elevated in May, and available information suggested that inflation declined but remained elevated in June. In the second quarter, total nonfarm payroll employ- ment posted its slowest average monthly increase since the recovery began in mid-2020, though payroll gains re- mained robust compared with those seen before the pandemic. Similarly, the private-sector job openings rate, as measured by the Job Openings and Labor Turn- over Survey, fell in May to its lowest level since March 2021 but remained well above pre-pandemic levels. The unemployment rate edged down to 3.6 percent in June, while the labor force participation rate and the employ- ment-to-population ratio were both unchanged. The unemployment rates for African Americans and Hispan- ics, however, both rose and were well above the national average. Average hourly earnings rose 4.4 percent over the 12 months ending in June, compared with a year- earlier increase of 5.4 percent. Consumer price inflation continued to show signs of easing but remained elevated. Total PCE price inflation was 3.8 percent over the 12 months ending in May, and core PCE price inflation, which excludes changes in en- ergy prices and many consumer food prices, was 4.6 per- cent over the same period. The trimmed mean measure _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Minutes of the Meeting of July 25–26, 2023 Page 3 of 12-month PCE price inflation constructed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas was 4.6 percent in May. In June, the 12-month change in the CPI was 3.0 per- cent, while core CPI inflation was 4.8 percent over the same period. Measures of short-term inflation expecta- tions had moved down alongside actual inflation but re- mained above pre-pandemic levels. In contrast, measures of medium- to longer-term inflation expecta- tions were in the range seen in the decade before the pandemic. Available indicators suggested that real GDP rose in the second quarter at a pace similar to the one posted in the first quarter. However, private domestic final pur- chases—which includes PCE, residential investment, and business fixed investment and which often provides a better signal of underlying economic momentum than does GDP—appeared to have decelerated in the second quarter. Manufacturing output rose in the second quar- ter, supported by a robust increase in motor vehicle pro- duction. After falling sharply in April, real exports of goods picked up in May, led by higher exports of industrial sup- plies and automotive products. Real goods imports fell, as lower imports of consumer goods and industrial sup- plies more than offset higher imports of capital goods. The nominal U.S. international trade deficit narrowed, as a sharp decline in nominal imports of goods and services outpaced a decline in exports. The available data sug- gested that net exports subtracted from U.S. GDP growth in the second quarter. Indicators of economic activity, such as purchasing man- agers indexes (PMIs), pointed to a step-down in the pace of foreign growth in the second quarter, reflecting fading of the impetus from China’s reopening, continued ane- mic growth in Europe, some weakening of activity in Canada and Mexico, as well as weak external demand and the slump in the high-tech industry weighing on many Asian economies. Incoming data also indicated that global manufacturing activity remained weak during the intermeeting period. Foreign headline inflation continued to fall, reflecting, in part, the pass-through of previous declines in commod- ity prices to retail energy and food prices. Core inflation edged down in many countries but generally remained high. In this context, and amid tight labor market con- ditions, many AFE central banks raised policy rates and underscored the need to raise rates further, or hold them at sufficiently restrictive levels, to bring inflation in their countries back to their targets. In contrast, central banks of emerging market economies largely remained on hold, and some indicated that a rate cut is possible at their next meeting. Staff Review of the Financial Situation Over the intermeeting period, market participants inter- preted domestic economic data releases as indicating continued resilience of economic activity and some eas- ing of inflationary pressures, and they viewed monetary policy communications as pointing to somewhat more restrictive policy than expected. The market-implied path for the federal funds rate rose modestly, and nom- inal Treasury yields increased somewhat at shorter ma- turities. Meanwhile, broad equity prices increased, and spreads on investment- and speculative-grade corporate bonds narrowed moderately. Financing conditions con- tinued to be generally restrictive, and borrowing costs remained elevated. Over the intermeeting period, the market-implied path for the federal funds rate rose modestly, while the timing of the path’s slightly higher peak moved a little later, to just after the November meeting. Beyond this year, the policy rate path implied by overnight index swap (OIS) quotes ended the period modestly higher. Yields on Treasury securities increased modestly at shorter matur- ities but only a bit at longer maturities. Measures of in- flation compensation rose only slightly for near-term and longer maturities. Measures of uncertainty about the path of the policy rate derived from interest rate op- tions remained very elevated by historical standards. Broad stock price indexes increased and spreads on in- vestment- and speculative-grade corporate bonds nar- rowed moderately over the intermeeting period. The VIX—the one-month option-implied volatility on the S&P 500—edged down and ended the period near the 25th percentile of its historical distribution. Bank equity prices increased and outperformed the S&P 500 mod- estly. Stock prices for the largest banks fully recovered from their declines in the immediate wake of the failure of Silicon Valley Bank, while those for regional banks remained below the levels seen in early March. Short-term interest rates in the AFEs increased mod- estly, on net, over the intermeeting period as foreign cen- tral banks continued to raise policy rates and signal the potential for further tightening. Increases in yields were tempered, however, by downside surprises to both infla- tion and PMIs from some economies. Risk sentiment in foreign markets improved somewhat, with most foreign equity indexes increasing and foreign corporate and emerging market sovereign bond spreads narrowing. The staff’s trade-weighted broad dollar index declined moderately, with the largest moves following releases of Page 4 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ weaker-than-expected U.S. labor market data and lower- than-expected U.S. inflation data. Conditions in domestic short-term funding markets re- mained generally stable over the intermeeting period. Spreads in unsecured markets narrowed modestly amid slight increases in OIS rates. Following the suspension of the debt limit, the Treasury Department partly replen- ished the TGA via a large net increase in bill issuance. Auctions of Treasury bills were met with robust demand, as shorter-term bill yields increased relative to other money market rates. Money market funds increased their holdings of Treasury bills and reduced their invest- ments with the ON RRP facility. ON RRP take-up de- clined notably—about $390 billion—over the intermeet- ing period, reflecting more attractive rates on some al- ternatives to investing in the ON RRP facility. Despite reduced ON RRP take-up, money funds maintained rel- atively high asset allocations in overnight repurchase agreement investments amid still-elevated uncertainty about the future path of policy. In domestic credit markets, borrowing costs for busi- nesses, households, and municipalities were little changed over the intermeeting period and remained ele- vated by historical standards. Yields on agency commer- cial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) were little changed. The banking sector’s ability to fund loans to businesses and consumers was generally stable during the inter- meeting period. Core deposit volumes at both large and other domestic banks held steady at the levels that they reached in early May, after having declined sharply in March and April amid the banking-sector turmoil. Banks continued to attract inflows of large time depos- its, reflecting higher interest rates offered on new certif- icates of deposit. Meanwhile, wholesale borrowing— which primarily consists of advances from Federal Home Loan Banks, loans from the Bank Term Funding Program, and other credit extended by the Federal Re- serve—had fallen since May by domestic banks of all sizes, partially reversing the surge at the onset of the bank turmoil in March. Credit availability for businesses appeared to tighten somewhat in recent months. Credit from capital mar- kets was somewhat subdued but overall remained acces- sible for larger corporations. Issuance of leveraged loans remained limited, reflecting low levels of leveraged buy- out and merger and acquisition activity as well as weak investor demand. In the municipal bond market, gross issuance was solid in June, as both refundings and new capital issuance picked up from a somewhat subdued May. Commercial and industrial (C&I) loan balances contracted modestly in the second quarter, and commer- cial real estate (CRE) loan growth on banks’ books con- tinued to moderate. In the July Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices (SLOOS), banks reported having tightened standards and terms on C&I loans to firms of all sizes in the second quarter. The most cited reason for tightening C&I standards and terms continued to be concerns about the economic outlook. Banks also re- ported expecting to tighten C&I standards further over the remainder of the year. The July SLOOS also indicated that standards across all CRE loan categories tightened further in the second quarter and that banks expected to tighten CRE stand- ards further over the second half of the year. Meanwhile, CMBS issuance picked up a bit in May and then ticked down in June after recording low volumes earlier in the year. Credit in the residential mortgage market remained broadly available for high-credit-score borrowers who met standard conforming loan criteria. Only modest net percentages of banks in the July SLOOS reported tightening standards for mortgage loans eligible to be purchased by government-sponsored enterprises, while a moderate net percentage of banks reported expecting to tighten lending standards further for these loans over the second half of the year. Meanwhile, the availability of mortgage credit remained tighter for households with lower credit scores, at levels close to those prevailing be- fore the pandemic. Banks reported in the SLOOS that they had tightened standards for certain categories of residential real estate loans to be held on their balance sheets, such as jumbo loans and home equity lines of credit. In addition, banks reported expecting to tighten standards for jumbo loans during the remainder of 2023. Conditions remained generally accommodative in con- sumer credit markets, with credit available for most bor- rowers. Credit card balances increased in the second quarter, though at a somewhat slower pace than in pre- vious months. In the July SLOOS, banks reported ex- pecting to continue tightening lending standards for credit card loans. Overall, the credit quality of most businesses and house- holds remained solid. While there were signs of deteri- oration in credit quality in some sectors, such as the of- fice segment of CRE, delinquency rates generally re- mained near their pre-pandemic lows. The credit quality _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Minutes of the Meeting of July 25–26, 2023 Page 5 of C&I and CRE loans on banks’ balance sheets re- mained sound as of the end of the first quarter of 2023. However, in the July SLOOS, banks frequently cited concerns about the credit quality of both CRE and other loans as reasons for expecting to tighten their lending standards over the remainder of the year. Aggregate de- linquency rates on pools of commercial mortgages back- ing CMBS increased in May and June. The staff provided an update on its assessment of the stability of the financial system and, on balance, charac- terized the financial vulnerabilities of the U.S. financial system as notable. The staff judged that asset valuation pressures remained notable. In particular, measures of valuations in both residential and commercial property markets remained high relative to fundamentals. House prices, while having cooled earlier this year, started to rise again, and price-to-rent ratios remained at elevated levels and near those seen in the mid-2000s. Although commercial property prices moved down, developments in the CRE sector following the pandemic may have pro- duced a permanent shift away from traditional working patterns. If so, fundamentals in the sector could decline notably and contribute to a deterioration in credit qual- ity. The staff assessed that vulnerabilities associated with household and nonfinancial business leverage remained moderate overall. Aggregate household debt growth re- mained in line with income growth. While nonfinancial businesses remained highly leveraged and thus vulnera- ble to shocks, firms’ debt growth has been relatively sub- dued recently, and their ability to service that debt has been quite high, even among lower-rated firms. Lever- age in the financial sector was characterized as notable. In the banking sector, regulatory risk-based capital ratios showed the system remained well capitalized. However, while the overall banking system retained ample loss- bearing capacity, some banks experienced sizable de- clines in the fair value of their assets as a consequence of rising interest rates. Vulnerabilities associated with funding risks were also characterized as notable. Al- though a small number of banks saw notable outflows of deposits late in the first quarter and early in the second quarter, deposit flows later stabilized. Staff Economic Outlook The economic forecast prepared by the staff for the July FOMC meeting was stronger than the June projection. Since the emergence of stress in the banking sector in mid-March, indicators of spending and real activity had come in stronger than anticipated; as a result, the staff no longer judged that the economy would enter a mild recession toward the end of the year. However, the staff continued to expect that real GDP growth in 2024 and 2025 would run below their estimate of potential output growth, leading to a small increase in the unemployment rate relative to its current level. The staff continued to project that total and core PCE price inflation would move lower in coming years. Much of the step-down in core inflation was expected to occur over the second half of 2023, with forward-looking indi- cators pointing to a slowing in the rate of increase of housing services prices and with core nonhousing ser- vices prices and core goods prices expected to decelerate over the remainder of 2023. Inflation was anticipated to ease further over 2024 as demand–supply imbalances continued to resolve; by 2025, total PCE price inflation was expected to be 2.2 percent, and core inflation was expected to be 2.3 percent. The staff continued to judge that the risks to the baseline projection for real activity were tilted to the downside. Risks to the staff’s baseline inflation forecast were seen as skewed to the upside, given the possibility that infla- tion dynamics would prove to be more persistent than expected or that further adverse shocks to supply condi- tions might occur. Moreover, the additional monetary policy tightening that would be necessitated by higher or more persistent inflation represented a downside risk to the projection for real activity. Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook In their discussion of current economic conditions, par- ticipants noted that economic activity had been expand- ing at a moderate pace. Job gains had been robust in recent months, and the unemployment rate remained low. Inflation remained elevated. Participants agreed that the U.S. banking system was sound and resilient. They commented that tighter credit conditions for households and businesses were likely to weigh on eco- nomic activity, hiring, and inflation. However, partici- pants agreed that the extent of these effects remained uncertain. Against this background, the Committee re- mained highly attentive to inflation risks. In assessing the economic outlook, participants noted that real GDP growth had continued to exhibit resilience in the first half of the year and that the economy had been showing considerable momentum. A gradual slow- down in economic activity nevertheless appeared to be in progress, consistent with the restraint placed on de- mand by the cumulative tightening of monetary policy since early last year and the associated effects on finan- Page 6 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ cial conditions. Participants remarked on the uncer- tainty about the lags in the effects of monetary policy on the economy and discussed the extent to which the ef- fects on the economy stemming from the tightening that the Committee had undertaken had already materialized. Participants commented that monetary policy tightening appeared to be working broadly as intended and that a continued gradual slowing in real GDP growth would help reduce demand–supply imbalances in the economy. Participants assessed that the ongoing tightening of credit conditions in the banking sector, as evidenced in the most recent surveys of banks, also would likely weigh on economic activity in coming quarters. Participants noted the recent reduction in total and core inflation rates. However, they stressed that inflation remained unacceptably high and that further evidence would be required for them to be confident that inflation was clearly on a path toward the Committee’s 2 percent ob- jective. Participants continued to view a period of be- low-trend growth in real GDP and some softening in la- bor market conditions as needed to bring aggregate sup- ply and aggregate demand into better balance and reduce inflation pressures sufficiently to return inflation to 2 percent over time. Participants noted that consumer spending had recently exhibited considerable resilience, underpinned by, in ag- gregate, strong household balance sheets, robust job and income gains, a low unemployment rate, and rising con- sumer confidence. Nevertheless, tight financial condi- tions, primarily reflecting the cumulative effect of the Committee’s shift to a restrictive policy stance, were ex- pected to contribute to slower growth in consumption in the period ahead. Participants cited other factors that were likely leading to, or appeared consistent with, a slowdown in consumption, including the declining stock of excess savings, softening labor market conditions, and increased price sensitivity on the part of customers. Some participants observed that recent increases in home prices suggested that the housing sector’s re- sponse to monetary policy restraint may have peaked. In their discussion of the business sector, participants cited various improvements in firms’ cost structures. These included better-functioning supply chains, lower input costs, and an increased ability to hire and retain workers. Participants also discussed conditions that could lead to higher economic activity—such as leaner inventories and reduced expectations of a sharp eco- nomic slowdown—and factors that could lead to lower economic activity—such as continuing economic uncer- tainty, the vulnerabilities of the CRE market, and the on- going weakness of manufacturing output. Participants judged that, over coming quarters, firms would reduce the pace of their investment spending and hiring in re- sponse to tight financial conditions and the slowing of economic activity. Participants remarked that the labor market continued to be very tight but pointed to signs that demand and supply were coming into better balance. They noted ev- idence that labor demand was easing—including de- clines in job openings, lower quits rates, more part-time work, slower growth in hours worked, higher unemploy- ment insurance claims, and more moderate rates of nominal wage growth. In addition, they remarked on indications of increasing labor supply, including a fur- ther rise in the prime-age participation rate to a post- pandemic high. Participants also observed, however, that although growth in payrolls had slowed recently, it continued to exceed values consistent over time with an unchanged unemployment rate, and that nominal wages were still rising at rates above levels assessed to be con- sistent with the sustained achievement of the Commit- tee’s 2 percent inflation objective. Participants judged that further progress toward a balancing of demand and supply in the labor market was needed, and they ex- pected that additional softening in labor market condi- tions would take place over time. Participants cited a number of tentative signs that infla- tion pressures could be abating. These signs included some softening in core goods prices, lower online prices, evidence that firms were raising prices by smaller amounts than previously, slower increases in shelter prices, and recent declines in survey estimates of shorter- term inflation expectations and of inflation uncertainty. Various participants discussed the continued stability of longer-term inflation expectations at levels consistent with 2 percent inflation over time and the role that the Committee’s policy tightening had played in delivering this outcome. Nonetheless, several participants com- mented that significant disinflationary pressures had yet to become apparent in the prices of core services exclud- ing housing. Participants observed that, notwithstanding recent fa- vorable developments, inflation remained well above the Committee’s 2 percent longer-term objective and that el- evated inflation was continuing to harm businesses and households—low-income families in particular. Partici- pants stressed that the Committee would need to see more data on inflation and further signs that aggregate demand and aggregate supply were moving into better balance to be confident that inflation pressures were _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Minutes of the Meeting of July 25–26, 2023 Page 7 abating and that inflation was on course to return to 2 percent over time. Participants generally noted a high degree of uncertainty regarding the cumulative effects on the economy of past monetary policy tightening. Participants cited upside risks to inflation, including those associated with scenar- ios in which recent supply chain improvements and fa- vorable commodity price trends did not continue or in which aggregate demand failed to slow by an amount sufficient to restore price stability over time, possibly leading to more persistent elevated inflation or an unan- choring of inflation expectations. In discussing down- side risks to economic activity and inflation, participants considered the possibility that the cumulative tightening of monetary policy could lead to a sharper slowdown in the economy than expected, as well as the possibility that the effects of the tightening of bank credit conditions could prove more substantial than anticipated. In their discussion of financial stability, participants ob- served that the banking system was sound and resilient and that banking stress had calmed in recent months. Participants also noted that the most recent stress-test results indicated that large banks appeared to be well po- sitioned to withstand a severe recession. Various partic- ipants commented on risks that could affect some banks, including unrealized losses on assets resulting from ris- ing interest rates, significant reliance on uninsured de- posits, and increased funding costs. Participants also commented on risks associated with a potential sharp decline in CRE valuations that could adversely affect some banks and other financial institutions, such as in- surance companies, that are heavily exposed to CRE. Several participants noted the susceptibility of some nonbank financial institutions, such as money market funds or digital asset entities, to runs or instability. In addition, several participants emphasized the need for banks to establish readiness to use Federal Reserve li- quidity facilities and for the Federal Reserve to ensure its own readiness to provide liquidity during periods of stress. In their consideration of appropriate monetary policy ac- tions at this meeting, participants concurred that eco- nomic activity had been expanding at a moderate pace. The labor market remained very tight, with robust job gains in recent months and the unemployment rate still low, but there were continuing signs that supply and de- mand in the labor market were coming into better bal- ance. Participants also noted that tighter credit condi- tions facing households and businesses were a source of headwinds for the economy and would likely weigh on economic activity, hiring, and inflation. However, the extent of these effects remained uncertain. Although in- flation had moderated since the middle of last year, it remained well above the Committee’s longer-run goal of 2 percent, and participants remained resolute in their commitment to bring inflation down to the Committee’s 2 percent objective. Amid these economic conditions, almost all participants judged it appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 5¼ to 5½ per- cent at this meeting. Participants noted that this action would put the stance of monetary policy further into re- strictive territory, consistent with reducing demand–sup- ply imbalances in the economy and helping to restore price stability. A couple of participants indicated that they favored leaving the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged or that they could have supported such a proposal. They judged that maintaining the cur- rent degree of restrictiveness at this time would likely re- sult in further progress toward the Committee’s goals while allowing the Committee time to further evaluate this progress. All participants agreed that it was appro- priate to continue the process of reducing the Federal Reserve’s securities holdings, as described in its previ- ously announced Plans for Reducing the Size of the Fed- eral Reserve’s Balance Sheet. A number of participants noted that balance sheet runoff need not end when the Committee eventually begins to reduce the target range for the federal funds rate. In discussing the policy outlook, participants continued to judge that it was critical that the stance of monetary policy be sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to the Committee’s 2 percent objective over time. They noted that uncertainty about the economic outlook remained elevated and agreed that policy decisions at future meet- ings should depend on the totality of the incoming in- formation and its implications for the economic outlook and inflation as well as for the balance of risks. Partici- pants expected that the data arriving in coming months would help clarify the extent to which the disinflation process was continuing and product and labor markets were reaching a better balance between demand and sup- ply. This information would be valuable in determining the extent of additional policy firming that may be ap- propriate to return inflation to 2 percent over time. Par- ticipants also emphasized the importance of communi- cating as clearly as possible about the Committee’s data- dependent approach to policy and its firm commitment to bring inflation down to its 2 percent objective. Participants discussed several risk-management consid- erations that could bear on future policy decisions. With inflation still well above the Committee’s longer-run goal Page 8 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ and the labor market remaining tight, most participants continued to see significant upside risks to inflation, which could require further tightening of monetary pol- icy. Some participants commented that even though economic activity had been resilient and the labor mar- ket had remained strong, there continued to be down- side risks to economic activity and upside risks to the unemployment rate; these included the possibility that the macroeconomic effects of the tightening in financial conditions since the beginning of last year could prove more substantial than anticipated. A number of partici- pants judged that, with the stance of monetary policy in restrictive territory, risks to the achievement of the Com- mittee’s goals had become more two sided, and it was important that the Committee’s decisions balance the risk of an inadvertent overtightening of policy against the cost of an insufficient tightening. Committee Policy Actions In their discussion of monetary policy for this meeting, members agreed that economic activity had been ex- panding at a moderate pace. They also concurred that job gains had been robust in recent months, and the un- employment rate had remained low. Inflation had re- mained elevated. Members concurred that the U.S. banking system was sound and resilient. They also agreed that tighter credit conditions for households and businesses were likely to weigh on economic activity, hiring, and inflation but that the extent of these effects was uncertain. Members also concurred that they remained highly attentive to infla- tion risks. In support of the Committee’s objectives to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 per- cent over the longer run, members agreed to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 5¼ to 5½ per- cent. They also agreed that they would continue to as- sess additional information and its implications for mon- etary policy. In determining the extent of additional pol- icy firming that may be appropriate to return inflation to 2 percent over time, members concurred that they will take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects eco- nomic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments. In addition, members agreed to continue to reduce the Federal Reserve’s holdings of Treasury se- curities and agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities, as described in its previously announced plans. All members affirmed that they are strongly com- mitted to returning inflation to their 2 percent objective. Members agreed that, in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, they would continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. They would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals. Mem- bers also agreed that their assessments will take into ac- count a wide range of information, including readings on labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international develop- ments. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Open Market Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive, for release at 2:00 p.m.: “Effective July 27, 2023, the Federal Open Mar- ket Committee directs the Desk to: • Undertake open market operations as nec- essary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of 5¼ to 5½ percent. • Conduct standing overnight repurchase agreement operations with a minimum bid rate of 5.5 percent and with an aggregate operation limit of $500 billion. • Conduct standing overnight reverse repur- chase agreement operations at an offering rate of 5.3 percent and with a per-counter- party limit of $160 billion per day. • Roll over at auction the amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s hold- ings of Treasury securities maturing in each calendar month that exceeds a cap of $60 billion per month. Redeem Treasury coupon securities up to this monthly cap and Treasury bills to the extent that coupon principal payments are less than the monthly cap. • Reinvest into agency mortgage-backed se- curities (MBS) the amount of principal pay- ments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of agency debt and agency MBS received in each calendar month that exceeds a cap of $35 billion per month. • Allow modest deviations from stated amounts for reinvestments, if needed for operational reasons. _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Minutes of the Meeting of July 25–26, 2023 Page 9 • Engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settle- ment of the Federal Reserve’s agency MBS transactions.” The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below for release at 2:00 p.m.: “Recent indicators suggest that economic activ- ity has been expanding at a moderate pace. Job gains have been robust in recent months, and the unemployment rate has remained low. In- flation remains elevated. The U.S. banking system is sound and resilient. Tighter credit conditions for households and businesses are likely to weigh on economic ac- tivity, hiring, and inflation. The extent of these effects remains uncertain. The Committee re- mains highly attentive to inflation risks. The Committee seeks to achieve maximum em- ployment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. In support of these goals, the Committee decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 5¼ to 5½ percent. The Committee will continue to assess addi- tional information and its implications for mon- etary policy. In determining the extent of addi- tional policy firming that may be appropriate to return inflation to 2 percent over time, the Committee will take into account the cumula- tive tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial devel- opments. In addition, the Committee will con- tinue reducing its holdings of Treasury securi- ties and agency debt and agency mortgage- backed securities, as described in its previously announced plans. The Committee is strongly committed to returning inflation to its 2 percent objective. In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals. The Committee’s assessments will take into account a wide range of information, in- cluding readings on labor market conditions, in- flation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.” Voting for this action: Jerome H. Powell, John C. Williams, Michael S. Barr, Michelle W. Bowman, Lisa D. Cook, Austan D. Goolsbee, Patrick Harker, Philip N. Jefferson, Neel Kashkari, Lorie K. Logan, and Christopher J. Waller. Voting against this action: None. To support the Committee’s decision to raise the target range for the federal funds rate, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted unanimously to raise the interest rate paid on reserve balances to 5.4 per- cent, effective July 27, 2023. The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted unanimously to ap- prove a ¼ percentage point increase in the primary credit rate to 5.5 percent, effective July 27, 2023.6 It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Tuesday–Wednesday, September 19– 20, 2023. The meeting adjourned at 10:05 a.m. on July 26, 2023. Notation Vote By notation vote completed on July 3, 2023, the Com- mittee unanimously approved the minutes of the Com- mittee meeting held on June 13–14, 2023. _______________________ Joshua Gallin Secretary 6 In taking this action, the Board approved requests to estab- lish that rate submitted by the Boards of Directors of the Fed- eral Reserve Banks of Boston, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Rich- mond, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco. The vote also encompassed approval by the Board of Governors of the establishment of a 5.5 percent primary credit rate by the remaining Federal Reserve Banks, effective on the later of July 27, 2023, or the date such Reserve Banks inform the Secretary of the Board of such a request.

Wood, Special Adviser to the Board, Division of Board Members, Board Rebecca Zarutskie, Special Adviser to the Board, Division of Board Members, Board Andrei Zlate, Group Manager, Division of Monetary Affairs, Board Developments in Financial Markets and Open Market Operations The manager turned first to a review of developments in financial markets over the intermeeting period. U.S. data releases generally pointed to greater economic resilience than previously thought, and the reaction in market pric- ing implied both a higher expected trajectory for the pol- icy rate at longer horizons and higher term premiums. Policy-sensitive rates rose moderately, and longer-dated forward rates displayed larger increases. Ten-year Treas- ury yields ended the period more than 40 basis points higher, and broad measures of equity prices fell. Bank equity prices underperformed over the period, but taking a somewhat longer view, investor sentiment toward the Page 2 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ banking sector appeared to have largely stabilized, with less differentiation of equity price movements across bank types. The dollar broadly appreciated against ad- vanced-economy currencies over the period, as stronger U.S. data supported moderately increased yield differen- tials against these economies amid perceptions that pol- icy rates were at or near their peaks. In China, signs of strain in the property sector increased, and optimism about growth diminished further, on net, although broader markets, including global commodity markets, did not appear to show elevated concern about China- related risks. U.S. financial conditions tightened, with higher longer-term rates, lower equity prices, and a stronger dollar contributing roughly equally to the in- crease in various financial conditions indexes. In addressing the increase in nominal yields on longer- run Treasury securities over the intermeeting period, the manager noted that the rise in real yields exceeded that of nominal yields over the period, implying a small de- cline in inflation compensation. Inflation expectations appeared to remain very well anchored. Market partici- pants cited various factors for the rise in longer-term nominal yields, including stronger-than-expected eco- nomic data, a possible increase in the neutral policy rate, greater economic and policy uncertainty, and larger- than-expected borrowing by the Treasury. Household and corporate borrowing rates increased over the period, generally rising in line with Treasury yields. Still, market participants noted that, with house- hold and corporate borrowers having a limited need to refinance debt in the near term, it could take more time for past monetary policy actions to fully pass through to these sectors. Regarding expectations for the September FOMC meet- ing, the manager noted that responses to the Open Mar- ket Desk’s Survey of Primary Dealers and Survey of Market Participants and market pricing all pointed to a virtual certainty of no change in the policy rate. In addi- tion, modal expectations for the policy rate from the sur- veys were that the current target range would be main- tained until the May 2024 FOMC meeting, compared with March in the previous survey, with a roughly one- in-three chance of a 25 basis point increase by the No- vember FOMC meeting. For horizons beyond the mid- dle of next year, the modal path from the surveys was notably lower than the market-implied path. The manager turned next to developments in money markets and Desk operations. Usage of the overnight reverse repurchase agreement (ON RRP) facility contin- ued to decline over the intermeeting period, largely re- flecting reduced participation by government and prime money market funds even as these funds continued to see inflows. Increased supply of money market instru- ments, especially Treasury bills, contributed to a slight increase in money market rates, which appeared to in- duce money funds to shift away from ON RRP toward other instruments. However, the ON RRP facility con- tinued to provide an effective floor for the federal funds rate. With ON RRP balances falling more than Federal Reserve assets, reserve balances grew over the period. At more than $3.3 trillion, reserves remained abundant. In the September Survey of Primary Dealers, respond- ents generally saw a lower path for ON RRP participa- tion and a higher path for reserves, compared with the July survey. By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk’s domestic transactions over the intermeeting period. There were no intervention operations in foreign curren- cies for the System’s account during the intermeeting pe- riod. Staff Review of the Economic Situation The data available at the time of the September 19–20 meeting suggested that real gross domestic product (GDP) was rising at a solid pace in the third quarter. The labor market continued to be tight, with the unemploy- ment rate low and job gains slowing but remaining strong. Consumer price inflation was still elevated. The imbalance between labor demand and supply ap- peared to be easing. Total nonfarm payroll employment increased at a slower pace over July and August than in the second quarter. The private-sector job openings rate and the quits rate, both measured by the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, moved down further through July. Over July and August, the unemployment rate edged up, on net, and stood at 3.8 percent in August, and both the labor force participation rate (LFPR) and the employment-to-population ratio rose slightly. The unemployment rate for African Americans declined, while the jobless rate for Hispanics rose, and both rates were still above the national average. The easing of labor market imbalances was also evident in the recent wage data, with the 12-month changes in average hourly earn- ings and the employment cost index, and the four-quar- ter change in business-sector compensation per hour all lower than their year-earlier levels. Consumer price inflation remained elevated but contin- ued to show signs of slowing. The total price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE) increased 3.3 percent over the 12 months ending in July, and core Minutes of the Meeting of September 19–20, 2023 Page 3 _____________________________________________________________________________________________ PCE price inflation, which excludes changes in energy prices and many consumer food prices, was 4.2 percent over the same period; both total and core PCE price in- flation were lower than a year earlier. The trimmed mean measure of 12-month PCE price inflation con- structed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas was 4.1 percent in July, down from its level earlier in the year. In August, the 12-month change in the consumer price index (CPI) was 3.7 percent, while core CPI inflation was 4.3 percent over the same period, and both total and core CPI inflation were well below their year-earlier lev- els. Survey measures of consumers’ short-term inflation expectations had moved down alongside actual inflation but remained above pre-pandemic levels. In contrast, survey measures of medium- to longer-term inflation ex- pectations remained in the range seen in the decade be- fore the pandemic. Available indicators suggested that real GDP was ex- panding at a solid pace in the third quarter. Private do- mestic final purchases—which includes PCE, residential investment, and business fixed investment (BFI) and of- ten provides a better signal of underlying economic mo- mentum than does GDP—also looked to be rising sol- idly, led by gains in both PCE and BFI. After falling in the second quarter, real goods exports increased in July, supported by higher exports of auto- motive products. Real goods imports also rose, as im- ports of consumer goods and capital goods partially re- covered from their declines in recent months. The nom- inal U.S. international trade deficit widened, as growth in imports of goods and services outpaced that of exports. Foreign economic growth slowed in the second quarter, as troubles in the property sector weighed on economic activity in China and monetary policy restraint contrib- uted to the slowing in economic growth in Europe. Available data for the third quarter, such as purchasing managers indexes and measures of business confidence, pointed to a continued subdued pace of economic activ- ity abroad. Foreign headline inflation continued to fall but remained elevated. In several economies, though, energy prices turned up again. In the context of still-high core infla- tion, some central banks in advanced foreign economies (AFEs) raised their policy rates, despite a slowdown in economic activity, and indicated their intention to hold these rates at sufficiently restrictive levels to bring infla- tion back to target rates. In contrast, central banks of emerging market economies largely remained on hold, and some even began to cut rates amid easing inflation- ary pressures. Staff Review of the Financial Situation Over the intermeeting period, generally robust eco- nomic data led to moderate increases in the market- implied path of the federal funds rate and yields on shorter-term Treasury securities. Yields on medium- and longer-term nominal Treasury securities rose more substantially, mainly reflecting higher term premiums and higher real yields. Stock prices declined somewhat, but spreads on investment- and speculative-grade cor- porate bonds were little changed. Financing conditions tightened somewhat, and borrowing costs increased moderately. Market participants pointed to a range of factors that may have contributed to the increase in longer-term for- ward rates, including higher term premiums and upward revisions to market views of the likely path of Treasury debt over time. Real yields increased almost as much as or a little more than nominal yields, leaving implied measures of inflation compensation modestly changed. The market-implied path for the federal funds rate in the near term was up slightly since the July FOMC meeting, and the expected path further out, implied by overnight index swap contracts, rose moderately. Broad equity price indexes declined somewhat, and the one-month option-implied volatility on the S&P 500 in- dex edged up slightly, on net, and stood near the 25th percentile of its historical distribution. Conditions in domestic short-term funding markets re- mained stable over the intermeeting period. Both prime and government money market funds experienced mod- erate inflows since the July FOMC meeting. Against a backdrop of heavy issuance of Treasury bills and the modest associated upward pressure on Treasury bill yields, take-up in the ON RRP facility continued to de- cline over the period and fell below $1.5 trillion late in the period. Over the intermeeting period, the dollar appreciated, as U.S. economic data came in stronger than expected, while foreign data suggested slowing economic growth abroad. Long-term yields in AFEs ended the period higher, reflecting spillovers from higher U.S. yields and, to a lesser extent, the increase in Japanese yields follow- ing the decision by the Bank of Japan to effectively widen its target range for the 10-year Japanese yield. Global equity prices declined moderately, reflecting higher long-term yields and increased concerns about the foreign economic outlook. Bond and equity funds focused on emerging markets saw moderate outflows. Page 4 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ In domestic credit markets, borrowing rates for busi- nesses, households, and municipalities increased moder- ately over the intermeeting period, mostly reflecting a pass-through of higher yields on longer-maturity Treas- ury securities to those borrowing rates. Interest rates on newly originated bank loans to businesses and house- holds increased over the second quarter, interest rates on credit card offers increased in July, and interest rates on auto loans increased in July and August. Bank credit conditions appeared to tighten somewhat over the intermeeting period, but credit to businesses and households remained generally accessible. Com- mercial and industrial loan balances contracted, but out- standing commercial real estate (CRE) loans increased from July through late August, though at a slower pace than earlier in the year. Within the category of CRE loans, nonfarm nonresidential loans contracted over the summer for the first time since March 2022. Bank fund- ing conditions were generally stable. Core deposits de- clined but were offset by inflows of large time deposits. Credit was available for most consumers. Credit card balances grew in the second quarter through late August. For residential real estate borrowers, credit availability was little changed. Credit conditions for small busi- nesses were also fairly stable. The PayNet Small Busi- ness Lending Index indicated that loan originations edged up in July and stood above the median of its pre- pandemic level. Credit was generally accessible through capital markets, although issuance was subdued. Issu- ance of nonfinancial investment- and speculative-grade bonds was muted in July but picked up modestly in Au- gust, and issuance of municipal bonds was weak in July. New issuance of leveraged loans was subdued in July, and issuance of agency and non-agency commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) was soft in July and August. Credit quality deteriorated a little further across many sectors in recent months but remained broadly solid. In the CRE sector, delinquency rates on nonfarm nonresi- dential CRE bank loans rose over the second quarter, while delinquency rates on construction, land develop- ment, and multifamily loans were roughly unchanged. Delinquency rates of loans in CMBS pools increased, driven by the office and retail sectors. The office delin- quency rate rose more than 2 percentage points since January but remained below its pre-pandemic average. The delinquency rate for small business loans ticked up in June and July. Delinquency rates for credit cards and auto loans increased further in the second quarter and stood a bit above their average levels in the years leading up to the pandemic. The fraction of potential borrowers with a prime credit score expanded through the second quarter, moving further above its pre-pandemic level. The trailing default rates for investment- and specula- tive-grade corporate bonds increased in July but re- mained at historically low levels. The trailing default rate for leveraged loans was little changed, on net, but down- grades of leveraged loans surpassed upgrades in July and August. In contrast to many other types of loans, the payment performance of home mortgages improved. Delin- quency rates of Federal Housing Administration and Department of Veterans Affairs loans in July were lower than levels seen earlier this year, and delinquency rates of conventional loans remained at historical lows. Credit quality was also strong for municipal borrowers. Staff Economic Outlook The economic forecast prepared by the staff for the Sep- tember FOMC meeting was stronger than the July pro- jection, as consumer and business spending appeared to be more resilient to tight financial conditions than pre- viously expected. The staff assumed that GDP growth for the rest of this year would be damped a bit by the autoworkers’ strike, with these effects unwound by a small boost to GDP growth next year. The size and tim- ing of these effects were highly uncertain. In all, the staff projected that real GDP growth in 2024 through 2026 would be slower, on average, than this year and would run below the staff’s estimate of potential output growth, restrained over the next couple of years by the lagged effects of monetary policy actions. The unem- ployment rate was projected to remain roughly flat through 2026, as upward pressure from below-potential output growth was offset by downward pressure from further improvements in labor market functioning. Total and core PCE price inflation were forecast to be around 3.5 percent at the end of this year, and inflation was projected to move lower in coming years, as demand and supply in product and labor markets continued to move into better alignment. Total and core PCE price inflation were expected to be close to 2 percent in 2026. The staff continued to view the uncertainty around the baseline projection as considerable. Risks around the in- flation forecast were seen as skewed to the upside, given the possibility that inflation could prove to be more per- sistent than expected or that further adverse shocks to supply conditions might occur. Should these upside in- flation risks materialize, the response of monetary policy could, if coupled with an adverse reaction in financial Minutes of the Meeting of September 19–20, 2023 Page 5 _____________________________________________________________________________________________ markets, tilt the risks around the forecast for economic activity to the downside. Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, participants submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and infla- tion for each year from 2023 through 2026 and over the longer run. The projections were based on their individ- ual assessments of appropriate monetary policy, includ- ing the path of the federal funds rate. The longer-run projections represented each participant’s assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy. A Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) was released to the public following the conclusion of the meeting. Regarding the economic outlook, participants assessed that real GDP had been expanding at a solid pace and had been more resilient than expected. Nevertheless, participants also noted that they expected that real GDP growth would slow in the near term. Participants judged that the current stance of monetary policy was restrictive and that it broadly appeared to be restraining the econ- omy as intended. Participants stressed that current in- flation remained unacceptably high while acknowledging that it had moderated somewhat over the past year. They also noted that further evidence would be required for them to be confident that inflation was clearly on a path to the Committee’s 2 percent objective. Partici- pants continued to view a period of below-trend growth in real GDP and some softening in labor market condi- tions as likely to be needed to bring aggregate demand and aggregate supply into better balance and reduce in- flation pressures sufficiently to return inflation to 2 per- cent over time. In their discussion of the household sector, participants observed that aggregate consumer spending had contin- ued to exhibit considerable strength, supported by the strong labor market and by generally strong household balance sheets. However, many participants remarked that the finances of some households were coming un- der pressure amid high inflation and declining savings and that there had been an increasing reliance on credit to finance expenditures. In addition, tighter credit con- ditions, waning fiscal support for families, and a resump- tion of student loan payments were viewed by several participants as having the potential to weigh on the growth of consumption. While household credit quality was seen as generally strong, a few participants noted ris- ing delinquency rates on some types of consumer credit. A couple of participants also remarked that households were becoming increasingly price sensitive. Some par- ticipants noted that housing demand was resilient de- spite higher interest rates; new home construction was solid, in part reflecting the limited inventory of homes available for sale. Regarding the business sector, participants noted that activity continued to be solid, though several pointed to signs of softening conditions. Many participants noted improved business conditions from an increased ability to hire and retain workers, better-functioning supply chains, or reduced input cost pressures. A few partici- pants commented that their business contacts had re- ported difficulties passing on cost increases to custom- ers. Several participants judged that, over coming quar- ters, business activity would be restrained by tighter fi- nancial conditions, such as higher interest rates and more constrained access to bank credit. Several partici- pants noted, however, that the tightening of credit con- ditions resulting from the banking stresses earlier in the year was likely to be less severe than they previously ex- pected. A number of participants expressed concerns about vulnerabilities in the CRE sector. Many partici- pants commented that they expected that the autowork- ers’ strike would, in the near term, result in a slowdown in production of motor vehicles and parts and possibly put upward pressure on automobile prices, but that these effects would be temporary. With respect to the agricul- tural sector, a few participants noted that conditions were mixed, as crop prices had declined amid higher pro- duction estimates and as supply and demand imbalances pushed up the prices of some types of livestock and held down the prices of others. Participants observed that the labor market was tight but that supply and demand conditions were continuing to come into better balance. Most participants remarked that a range of indicators of labor demand were easing— as could be seen by declines in job openings, a narrowing of the jobs-to-workers gap, lower quits rates, and a re- duction in average weekly hours worked to levels at or below those seen before the pandemic. However, sev- eral participants noted that labor markets remained very tight in some sectors of the economy, such as health- care services and education. Many participants also ob- served that measures of labor supply, especially the LFPR, had moved up. Some participants commented that the increase in the LFPR for women had been par- ticularly notable, although they expressed concern that challenges regarding the availability of childcare could Page 6 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ affect the sustainability of this increase in participation. Several participants noted that immigration had also been boosting labor supply. Some participants observed that payroll growth remained strong but had slowed in recent months to a pace closer to that consistent with maintaining a constant unemployment rate over time. Most participants commented that the pace of nominal wage increases had moderated, and a few also mentioned that the wage premium for job switchers had come down. They noted, however, that nominal wages were still rising at rates above levels generally assessed to be consistent with the sustained achievement of the Com- mittee’s 2 percent inflation objective, given current esti- mates of trend productivity growth. Participants noted that the data received over the past several months generally suggested that inflation was slowing. Even with these favorable developments, they emphasized that further progress was needed to get in- flation sustainably to 2 percent. Participants pointed to the softening of price inflation for goods amid improv- ing supply conditions and to declining housing services inflation. Several participants remarked that, despite the recent rise in energy prices, food and energy prices over the past year had contributed to a decline in overall in- flation. However, participants also noted that significant progress in reducing inflation had yet to become appar- ent in the prices of core services excluding housing. Par- ticipants noted that longer-term inflation expectations remained well anchored and that shorter-term inflation expectations had been moving down from elevated lev- els. Participants observed that, notwithstanding recent favorable developments, inflation remained well above the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run objective and that elevated inflation was continuing to harm businesses and households—particularly low-income households. Par- ticipants stressed that they would need to see more data indicating that inflation pressures were abating to be more confident that inflation was on course to return to 2 percent over time. Participants generally noted there was still a high degree of uncertainty surrounding the economic outlook. One new source of uncertainty was that associated with the autoworkers’ strike, and many participants observed that an intensification of the strike posed both an upside risk to inflation and a downside risk to activity. A majority of participants pointed to upside risks to inflation from rising energy prices that could undo some of the recent disinflation or to the risk that inflation would prove more persistent than expected. Various participants noted downside risks to economic activity, including that credit conditions might tighten more than expected if the domestic banking sector experienced further strains; the possibility that the economic slowdown in China could result in a drag on global economic growth; or that an extended U.S. government shutdown could have negative, albeit temporary, consequences for growth. Some participants remarked that an upside risk to their projections for economic activity was that the unexpected resilience that the economy had demon- strated so far could persist. Several participants com- mented that a government shutdown might result in the delayed release of some economic data and that this out- come would make it more difficult to assess economic conditions. A few participants observed that there were challenges in assessing the state of the economy because some data continued to be volatile and subject to large revisions. In their consideration of appropriate monetary policy ac- tions at this meeting, participants concurred that eco- nomic activity had been expanding at a solid pace and had been resilient. While the labor market remained tight, job gains had slowed, and there were continuing signs that supply and demand in the labor market were coming into better balance. Participants also noted that tighter credit conditions facing households and busi- nesses were a source of headwinds for the economy and would likely weigh on economic activity, hiring, and in- flation. However, the extent of these effects remained uncertain. Although inflation had moderated since the middle of last year, it remained well above the Commit- tee’s longer-run goal of 2 percent, and participants re- mained resolute in their commitment to bring inflation down to the Committee’s 2 percent objective. Amid these economic conditions, and in consideration of the significant cumulative tightening in the stance of mone- tary policy and the lags with which policy affects eco- nomic activity and inflation, almost all participants judged it appropriate to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 5¼ to 5½ percent at this meeting. Participants judged that maintaining this restrictive stance of policy would support further progress toward the Committee’s goals while allowing the Committee time to gather additional data to evaluate this progress. All participants agreed that it was appropriate to con- tinue the process of reducing the Federal Reserve’s se- curities holdings, as described in its previously an- nounced Plans for Reducing the Size of the Federal Re- serve’s Balance Sheet. In discussing the policy outlook, participants continued to judge that it was critical that the stance of monetary policy be kept sufficiently restrictive to return inflation Minutes of the Meeting of September 19–20, 2023 Page 7 _____________________________________________________________________________________________ to the Committee’s 2 percent objective over time. A ma- jority of participants judged that one more increase in the target federal funds rate at a future meeting would likely be appropriate, while some judged it likely that no further increases would be warranted. All participants agreed that the Committee was in a position to proceed carefully and that policy decisions at every meeting would continue to be based on the totality of incoming information and its implications for the economic out- look as well as the balance of risks. Participants expected that the data arriving in coming months would help clar- ify the extent to which the disinflation process was con- tinuing and labor markets were reaching a better balance between demand and supply. This information would be valuable in determining the extent of additional policy firming that may be appropriate to return inflation to 2 percent over time. Some participants also emphasized the importance of continuing to communicate clearly to the public about the Committee’s data-dependent ap- proach to policy and its firm commitment to bring infla- tion down to 2 percent. All participants agreed that policy should remain restric- tive for some time until the Committee is confident that inflation is moving down sustainably toward its objec- tive. A few participants noted that the pace at which inflation was returning to the Committee’s 2 percent goal would influence their views of the sufficiently re- strictive level of the policy rate and how long to keep policy restrictive. Several participants commented that, with the policy rate likely at or near its peak, the focus of monetary policy decisions and communications should shift from how high to raise the policy rate to how long to hold the policy rate at restrictive levels. A few partic- ipants noted that it would be important to monitor the real federal funds rate in gauging the stance of monetary policy over time. Most participants observed that postmeeting communications, including the SEP, would help clarify to the public how participants assessed the likely evolution of the stance of monetary policy. Par- ticipants observed that the continuing process of reduc- ing the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet was an important part of the overall approach to achieving their macroeconomic objectives. Several participants noted that the process of balance sheet runoff could continue for some time, even after the Committee be- gins to reduce the target range for the federal funds rate. A vast majority of participants continued to judge the future path of the economy as highly uncertain. Many noted data volatility and potential data revisions, or the difficulty of estimating the neutral policy rate, as sup- porting the case for proceeding carefully in determining the extent of additional policy firming that may be ap- propriate. Participants discussed several risk-management consid- erations that could bear on future policy decisions. Par- ticipants generally judged that, with the stance of mone- tary policy in restrictive territory, risks to the achieve- ment of the Committee’s goals had become more two sided. But with inflation still well above the Committee’s longer-run goal and the labor market remaining tight, most participants continued to see upside risks to infla- tion. These risks included the imbalance of aggregate demand and supply persisting longer than expected, as well as risks emanating from global oil markets, the po- tential for upside shocks to food prices, the effects of a strong housing market on shelter inflation, and the po- tential for more limited declines in goods prices. Many participants commented that even though economic ac- tivity had been resilient and the labor market had re- mained strong, there continued to be downside risks to economic activity and upside risks to the unemployment rate. Such risks included larger-than-anticipated lagged macroeconomic effects from the tightening in financial conditions, the effect of labor union strikes, slowing global growth, and continued weakness in the CRE sec- tor. Participants generally noted that it was important to balance the risk of overtightening against the risk of in- sufficient tightening. Committee Policy Actions In their discussion of monetary policy for this meeting, members agreed that economic activity had been ex- panding at a solid pace, and, accordingly, that the corre- sponding language in the postmeeting statement should be changed from “moderate” to “solid.” They also con- curred that job gains had slowed in recent months but remained strong, and the unemployment rate had re- mained low. Inflation had remained elevated. Members concurred that the U.S. banking system was sound and resilient. They also agreed that tighter credit conditions for households and businesses were likely to weigh on economic activity, hiring, and inflation but that the extent of these effects was uncertain. Members also concurred that they remained highly attentive to infla- tion risks. In support of the Committee’s objectives to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 per- cent over the longer run, members agreed to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 5¼ to 5½ percent. They also agreed that they would continue to assess additional information and its implications for monetary policy. In determining the extent of additional Page 8 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ policy firming that may be appropriate to return inflation to 2 percent over time, members concurred that they would take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy af- fects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments. In addition, members agreed to continue to reduce the Federal Reserve’s holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and mortgage- backed securities, as described in its previously an- nounced plans. All members affirmed that they are strongly committed to returning inflation to their 2 per- cent objective. Members agreed that, in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, they would continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. They would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals. Mem- bers also agreed that their assessments will take into ac- count a wide range of information, including readings on labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international develop- ments. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Open Market Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive, for release at 2:00 p.m.: “Effective September 21, 2023, the Federal Open Market Committee directs the Desk to:  Undertake open market operations as nec- essary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of 5¼ to 5½ percent.  Conduct standing overnight repurchase agreement operations with a minimum bid rate of 5.5 percent and with an aggregate operation limit of $500 billion.  Conduct standing overnight reverse repur- chase agreement operations at an offering rate of 5.3 percent and with a per-counter- party limit of $160 billion per day.  Roll over at auction the amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s hold- ings of Treasury securities maturing in each calendar month that exceeds a cap of $60 billion per month. Redeem Treasury coupon securities up to this monthly cap and Treasury bills to the extent that coupon principal payments are less than the monthly cap.  Reinvest into agency mortgage-backed se- curities (MBS) the amount of principal pay- ments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of agency debt and agency MBS received in each calendar month that exceeds a cap of $35 billion per month.  Allow modest deviations from stated amounts for reinvestments, if needed for operational reasons.  Engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settle- ment of the Federal Reserve’s agency MBS transactions.” The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below for release at 2:00 p.m.: “Recent indicators suggest that economic activ- ity has been expanding at a solid pace. Job gains have slowed in recent months but remain strong, and the unemployment rate has re- mained low. Inflation remains elevated. The U.S. banking system is sound and resilient. Tighter credit conditions for households and businesses are likely to weigh on economic ac- tivity, hiring, and inflation. The extent of these effects remains uncertain. The Committee re- mains highly attentive to inflation risks. The Committee seeks to achieve maximum em- ployment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. In support of these goals, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 5¼ to 5½ percent. The Committee will continue to assess additional information and its implica- tions for monetary policy. In determining the extent of additional policy firming that may be appropriate to return inflation to 2 percent over time, the Committee will take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects eco- nomic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments. In addition, the Com- mittee will continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities, as described in its previously announced plans. The Committee is Minutes of the Meeting of September 19–20, 2023 Page 9 _____________________________________________________________________________________________ strongly committed to returning inflation to its 2 percent objective. In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals. The Committee’s assessments will take into account a wide range of information, in- cluding readings on labor market conditions, in- flation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.” Voting for this action: Jerome H. Powell, John C. Williams, Michael S. Barr, Michelle W. Bowman, Lisa D. Cook, Austan D. Goolsbee, Patrick Harker, Philip N. Jefferson, Neel Kashkari, Adriana D. Kugler, Lorie K. Logan, and Christopher J. Waller. Voting against this action: None. Consistent with the Committee’s decision to leave the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted unanimously to maintain the interest rate paid on reserve balances at 5.4 percent, effective Septem- ber 21, 2023. The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted unanimously to approve the es- tablishment of the primary credit rate at the existing level of 5.5 percent, effective September 21, 2023. It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Tuesday–Wednesday, October 31– November 1, 2023. The meeting adjourned at 10:10 a.m. on September 20, 2023.

Finan- cial conditions continued to tighten, driven by higher Page 2 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ yields on Treasury securities as well as by lower equity prices and a stronger dollar, which themselves partly re- flected higher interest rates. Because earnings expecta- tions had held up well in recent months, the effect of higher interest rates on equity prices likely took place largely through valuations. The rise since July in yields on longer-dated nominal Treasury securities was mostly attributable to increases in real yields. There were small increases in inflation compensation, but the levels of spot and forward rates were within historical ranges. The manager also noted that survey measures pointed to generally stable inflation expectations, especially at longer horizons, and that in- flation expectations remained well anchored. Staff analysis and responses from the Open Market Desk’s Survey of Primary Dealers and Survey of Market Participants suggested that the bulk of the increase since July in the 10-year nominal Treasury yield could be at- tributed to a higher term premium, though higher policy expectations at longer horizons could also have played a role. The manager also noted that liquidity conditions in the Treasury market had not changed materially since July, suggesting that Treasury market liquidity had not been an important driver of the increase in yields. The manager turned next to expectations for monetary policy. Both market pricing and responses to the Desk’s surveys implied that market participants expected that the federal funds rate was at or near its peak and would be held there at least until the June 2024 FOMC meeting; there was a roughly 30 percent probability of a 25 basis point increase at either the December or January FOMC meeting. Regarding balance sheet policy, the surveys showed that respondents had pushed out the date they expected balance sheet runoff to stop, perhaps partly in response to policymakers’ communications that balance sheet runoff could continue even after the Committee begins to reduce the target range for the federal funds rate. The manager then turned to developments in money markets and Desk operations. Balance sheet runoff con- tinued to proceed smoothly over the intermeeting period through reduced holdings of Treasury securities, agency debt, and agency mortgage-backed securities. The con- tinued repayment by the Federal Deposit Insurance Cor- poration of discount window loans extended to banks that were placed into receivership also contributed to re- duced Federal Reserve assets. On the liabilities side of the balance sheet, usage of the overnight reverse repur- chase agreement (ON RRP) facility declined further, as money market mutual funds continued to absorb new Treasury bill issuance and appeared to increase invest- ment in the private market for repurchase agreements (repos) as well. Overall, the reduced usage of the ON RRP facility released more reserves than the reduc- tion in Federal Reserve assets and the increase in the Treasury General Account absorbed. On net, reserves expanded over the period, and available indicators pointed to them remaining abundant. Primary dealers indicated that reserves were projected to remain within their recent range for the next several quarters. The manager also noted that 23 banks, in addition to all pri- mary dealers, were already counterparties to the standing repo facility (SRF) and that several more were in the onboarding process. Together, these banks held the vast majority of SRF-eligible securities in the banking system. The SRF, in addition to the discount window, may there- fore prove helpful for supplying liquidity to the banking system should funding pressures emerge. By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk’s domestic transactions over the intermeeting period. There were no intervention operations in foreign curren- cies for the System’s account during the intermeeting pe- riod. Staff Review of the Economic Situation The data available at the time of the October 31–No- vember 1 meeting indicated that U.S. real gross domestic product (GDP) had expanded at a strong pace in the third quarter. Labor market conditions remained tight, with continued strong job gains and a low unemploy- ment rate. Consumer price inflation remained elevated. Labor demand and supply were slowly moving into bet- ter alignment. Easing labor market imbalances were ap- parent in the wage data, with the 12-month changes in average hourly earnings and the employment cost index each below their year-earlier levels. Although total non- farm payroll employment rose at a faster pace in Sep- tember than in previous months, the unemployment rate was unchanged at 3.8 percent; the labor force participa- tion rate and the employment-to-population ratio were also unchanged in September. The unemployment rate for African Americans rose, while the jobless rate for Hispanics declined; both rates were higher than the na- tional average. Consumer price inflation remained elevated but contin- ued to show signs of slowing. The price index for total personal consumption expenditures (PCE) increased 3.4 percent over the 12 months ending in September, while core PCE price inflation, which excludes changes in energy prices and many consumer food prices, was 3.7 percent over the same period; both total and core _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Minutes of the Meeting of October 31–November 1, 2023 Page 3 PCE price inflation were well below their year-earlier levels. The trimmed mean measure of 12-month PCE price inflation constructed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas was 3.8 percent in September, also down from the level posted a year ago. Survey measures of consum- ers’ short-run inflation expectations remained above their pre-pandemic levels. In contrast, survey measures of medium- to longer-term inflation expectations re- mained in the range seen in the decade before the pan- demic. According to the advance estimate, real GDP posted a strong gain in the third quarter. Private domestic final purchases, which includes PCE and private fixed invest- ment and often provides a better signal than GDP of underlying economic momentum, posted a smaller but still-solid increase. Real exports and imports of goods and services grew at a robust pace in the third quarter after falling sharply in the second quarter, reflecting broad-based strength across categories. Net exports made a slightly negative contribution to U.S. GDP growth in the third quarter, while the nominal trade deficit narrowed somewhat. Foreign economic growth remained subdued in the third quarter. Monetary policy restraint weighed on activity abroad, especially in Europe, where euro-area GDP growth registered a small decline and the latest Euro- pean Central Bank lending survey pointed to a contrac- tion in credit from a year ago. Although GDP growth in China improved in the third quarter, supported by an increase in industrial production, Chinese retail sales continued to be held back by low consumer confidence and weakness in the residential property sector. Inflation abroad remained elevated. While core inflation continued to ease amid slowing aggregate demand, en- ergy price inflation increased in many foreign econo- mies. With inflation still high, most major foreign cen- tral banks, while keeping their policy rates unchanged, indicated their intentions to hold these rates at suffi- ciently restrictive levels to bring inflation back to target rates. Staff Review of the Financial Situation Over the intermeeting period, longer-term Treasury yields rose notably, while shorter-term yields were little changed, and the market-implied path for the federal funds rate through 2024 declined slightly. The increase in longer-term Treasury yields appeared to be mostly at- tributable to higher term premiums, as stronger-than-ex- pected economic data seemed to increase the uncertainty regarding how long policy rates might need to remain high. Meanwhile, equity prices decreased, and spreads on investment- and speculative-grade corporate bonds widened. Financing conditions tightened further, and borrowing costs continued to rise. The market-implied path for the federal funds rate through 2024 declined slightly over the intermeeting pe- riod. Beyond 2024, the policy rate path implied by over- night index swap quotes increased, likely reflecting, in part, higher term premiums. The rise in longer-term nominal Treasury yields was driven by real yields. Short- term inflation compensation fluctuated notably over the intermeeting period, largely following the changes in en- ergy prices, but ended the period modestly lower. Broad stock price indexes declined over the intermeeting period. Equity prices in interest rate–sensitive sectors, such as real estate and utilities, underperformed the broader market. Stock prices of banks also declined more than broader equity indexes. The one-month op- tion-implied volatility on the S&P 500 index increased notably over the intermeeting period but remained be- low the peaks observed in the first quarter of 2023. Over the intermeeting period, foreign asset prices were largely driven by spillovers from the rise in longer-term U.S. Treasury yields. Longer-term sovereign bond yields for advanced foreign economies rose, foreign equity prices declined, foreign credit spreads generally widened, and investors continued to withdraw from emerging market economy funds. Stronger-than-expected U.S. data on economic activity and widening interest rate dif- ferentials between the U.S. and the rest of the world con- tributed to an increase in the staff’s broad dollar index. The Bank of Japan increased the flexibility of its yield curve control framework, which contributed to the rise in longer-term Japanese government bond yields. The armed conflict between Israel and Hamas left a limited net imprint on foreign financial markets over this period. Conditions in short-term funding markets remained sta- ble over the intermeeting period. Take-up in the ON RRP facility continued to decline over the period. That decline primarily reflected money market funds re- ducing their usage of the facility and increasing their holdings of Treasury bills and private market repos in response to slightly more attractive rates on these alter- native investments. Banks’ total deposit levels were roughly unchanged over the intermeeting period, as out- flows of core deposits were about offset by inflows of large time deposits, which tend to be more expensive sources of funding. Wholesale borrowing by large banks increased over the intermeeting period. Page 4 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ In domestic credit markets, borrowing costs for busi- nesses, households, and municipalities continued to rise from already elevated levels over the intermeeting pe- riod, primarily reflecting increases in longer-term Treas- ury yields. Interest rates on commercial and industrial (C&I) loans and small business loans increased, as did rates on loans to households, including for 30-year con- forming residential mortgages, new auto loans, and credit cards. Rates also moved up on a broad array of fixed-income securities, including residential and com- mercial mortgage-backed securities, municipal bonds, and corporate bonds. Yields on corporate bonds rose more than Treasury yields, particularly for speculative- grade bonds. Credit continued to be generally available to businesses, households, and municipalities. Total core loans on banks’ books continued to increase in the third quarter, although at a slower pace than earlier in the year. How- ever, smaller firms were finding it harder to obtain credit, with the share of small firms reporting in September that it was more difficult to obtain credit compared with three months earlier rising from an already elevated level. Capital market financing continued to be available, al- though issuance in most markets was below typical lev- els. In the October Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices (SLOOS), banks reported tight- ening standards and terms on C&I loans to firms of all sizes in the third quarter. The most frequently cited rea- sons for tightening C&I standards and terms included concerns about the economic outlook, a less favorable or more uncertain economic outlook, and the effects of potential legislative changes, supervisory actions, or changes in accounting standards. Banks also reported that demand for C&I loans weakened in the third quar- ter, with the most frequently cited reasons being de- creased investment in plant or equipment and decreased inventory financing needs. Similarly, banks indicated that commercial real estate (CRE) loan standards contin- ued to tighten and demand weakened further in the third quarter. Credit in the residential mortgage market remained easily available for high-credit-score borrowers who met standard conforming loan criteria. However, in the Oc- tober SLOOS, banks reported tighter standards and weaker demand for almost all categories of residential real estate loans in the third quarter. Consumer credit remained readily available for most borrowers, although there were signs of tightening standards. Credit card balances grew at a strong pace in August, while auto credit continued to grow at a modest pace. However, respondents to the October SLOOS re- ported tighter standards for all consumer loan categories in the third quarter. Meanwhile, outstanding student loan balances declined significantly in August, driven by the cancellation of student loan debt for certain borrow- ers. The credit quality of businesses, households, and munic- ipalities continued to show signs of deterioration in most sectors, as delinquency rates rose. The credit quality of nonfinancial firms borrowing in the corporate bond market remained sound overall, albeit with pockets of deterioration. The credit quality of C&I and CRE loans on banks’ balance sheets remained generally stable through August. However, delinquency rates for non- farm nonresidential CRE loans recently picked up. In the October SLOOS, banks frequently cited concerns about credit quality, including for both C&I and CRE loans, as reasons for tightening standards over the third quarter. The staff provided an update on its assessment of the stability of the financial system and, on balance, judged that the financial vulnerabilities of the U.S. financial sys- tem were notable. The staff characterized asset valua- tion pressures as notable. In particular, the staff noted that valuations in equities, housing, and CRE were high. The forward price-to-earnings ratio for S&P 500 firms increased to the upper quartile of its historical distribu- tion. House prices increased to the upper end of their historical range, relative to fundamentals, despite tight credit conditions in the mortgage market. While CRE prices declined, valuations remained stretched, with cap- italization rates remaining near historical lows. Funda- mentals in the office sector remained weak given the shift toward telework in many industries, especially for central business districts and coastal cities. Delinquency rates on commercial mortgage-backed securities moved up as office and retail loan performance deteriorated. Vulnerabilities associated with business and household debt were characterized as moderate. Leverage in the financial sector was characterized as no- table. In the banking sector, holdings of liquid assets remained high, and regulatory risk-based capital ratios indicated ample loss-bearing capacity in the banking sys- tem. However, the fair value of banks’ longer-term fixed-rate assets, including loans, decreased in the third quarter as longer-term interest rates rose. Hedge fund leverage remained above historical averages, particularly for the largest funds. Funding risks were also character- ized as notable. Reliance on uninsured deposits declined _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Minutes of the Meeting of October 31–November 1, 2023 Page 5 in the aggregate but remained high for some banks, and short-term nondeposit funding had increased. Staff Economic Outlook The economic forecast prepared by the staff for the Oc- tober–November meeting was similar to the September projection. The staff expected fourth-quarter GDP growth to slow markedly from its third-quarter rate. All told, however, average GDP growth over the second half of the year was projected to be a little faster than the first half’s pace. The staff also expected output in the fourth quarter to be temporarily restrained by the auto- workers’ strike before being boosted in the first quarter as lost production begins to be made up. The size and timing of these effects were highly uncertain, however. With the lagged effects of monetary policy actions ex- pected to restrain activity, real GDP was projected to rise more slowly than the staff’s estimate of potential over the next two years before rising in line with potential in 2026. The unemployment rate was expected to be roughly flat through 2026 as the effects of below-poten- tial output growth were offset by the effects of further improvements in labor market functioning. Total PCE price inflation was expected to be close to 3.0 percent by the end of this year, and core PCE infla- tion was expected to be around 3.5 percent. Inflation was projected to move lower in coming years as demand and supply in product and labor markets moved into better alignment; in 2026, total and core PCE price in- flation rates were expected to be close to 2 percent. The staff continued to view the uncertainty around the baseline projection as elevated. Risks around the infla- tion forecast were seen as skewed to the upside, given the possibility that inflation might prove to be more per- sistent than expected or that additional adverse shocks to supply conditions might occur. The risks to the fore- cast for real activity were viewed to be skewed to the downside. Moreover, the additional monetary policy tightening that would be necessitated by higher or more persistent inflation, and the potential for a greater tight- ening of financial conditions, represented a downside risk to the projection for real activity. Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook Participants noted that real GDP had expanded at an un- expectedly strong pace in the third quarter, boosted by a surge in consumer spending. Nevertheless, participants judged that aggregate demand and aggregate supply con- tinued to come into better balance, as a result of the cur- rent restrictive stance of monetary policy and the con- tinued normalization of aggregate supply conditions. Participants assessed that while labor market conditions remained tight, they had eased since earlier in the year, partly as a result of recent increases in labor supply. Par- ticipants judged that the current stance of monetary pol- icy was restrictive and was putting downward pressure on economic activity and inflation. In addition, they noted that financial conditions had tightened signifi- cantly in recent months. Participants noted that inflation had moderated over the past year but stressed that cur- rent inflation remained unacceptably high and well above the Committee’s longer-run goal of 2 percent. They also stressed that further evidence would be re- quired for them to be confident that inflation was clearly on a path to the Committee’s 2 percent objective. Par- ticipants continued to view a period of below-potential growth in real GDP and some further softening in labor market conditions as likely to be needed to reduce infla- tion pressures sufficiently to return inflation to 2 percent over time. In their discussion of the household sector, participants observed that the incoming data on consumer spending had again surprised to the upside, likely supported by a strong labor market and by generally solid household balance sheets. Nevertheless, some participants re- marked that the finances of some households—espe- cially those in the low- and moderate-income catego- ries—were increasingly coming under pressure amid high prices for food and other essentials as well as tight credit conditions. Several participants added that delin- quencies on auto loans and credit cards had risen for these households. Some participants commented that their District contacts reported a somewhat weaker pic- ture of consumer demand than indicated by the incom- ing aggregate data. Several participants, however, noted that repeated upside surprises in the aggregate spending data could indicate that considerable momentum could be sustained. A couple of these participants commented that the aggregate household sector may have more fi- nancial resources than previously thought, which could help account for the strength in spending. A few partic- ipants observed that activity in the housing sector had flattened out in recent months, likely reflecting the ef- fects of further increases in mortgage rates from already elevated levels. Business fixed investment was flat in the third quarter, and participants observed that conditions reported by their business contacts varied across industries and Dis- tricts. Some participants noted that businesses were benefiting from an increased ability to hire and retain workers, better-functioning supply chains, or reduced input cost pressures. A few participants commented Page 6 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ that their business contacts had reported that cost in- creases could not be easily passed on to customers. Sev- eral participants commented that the apparent resolu- tion of the United Auto Workers strike would reduce business-sector uncertainty. Several participants noted that an increasing number of District businesses were re- porting that higher interest rates were affecting their businesses or that firms were increasingly cutting or de- laying their investment plans because of higher borrow- ing costs and tighter bank lending conditions. A few participants noted that the tighter financial and credit conditions could be particularly challenging for small businesses. A few participants observed that higher in- terest rates were also affecting the agricultural sector, with their contacts noting that high financing costs were likely weighing on purchases of heavy agricultural equip- ment. Regarding the energy sector, a few participants observed that energy markets had calmed after signifi- cant volatility at the start of the current armed conflict between Israel and Hamas. Participants observed that the labor market remained tight. Payroll growth was unexpectedly strong in Sep- tember, and the unemployment rate remained low. Nev- ertheless, participants assessed that labor supply and la- bor demand were continuing to come into better bal- ance. Measures of labor supply had moved up, with the labor force participation rate for prime-age workers ris- ing this year, especially for women, and immigration also boosting labor supply. A few participants expressed concern that the recent pace of increases in labor supply might not be sustainable in light of challenges regarding the availability of childcare and the uncertainty regarding the extent to which immigration would continue to boost the growth of labor supply. Regarding labor de- mand, various measures appeared to indicate some eas- ing, including a downward trend in job openings, a lower quits rate, and reduced wage premiums offered to job switchers. Consistent with the gradual rebalancing of la- bor market conditions, participants commented that the pace of nominal wage increases had continued to mod- erate. A few participants noted, however, that nominal wages were still rising at rates above levels generally as- sessed to be consistent with the sustained achievement of the Committee’s 2 percent inflation objective, given current estimates of trend productivity growth. Participants observed that inflation had continued to moderate since the middle of last year. Both the 6- and 12-month change measures of core PCE price inflation had come down somewhat in recent months, despite a less favorable monthly reading in September. Partici- pants pointed to the softening of core goods prices in recent months, as well as the continued gradual decline in housing services inflation. However, participants also noted that there had been only limited progress in bring- ing down inflation in core services excluding housing. Participants noted that longer-term inflation expecta- tions remained well anchored. Participants observed that, notwithstanding the moderation of inflation so far, inflation remained well above the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run objective and that elevated inflation was con- tinuing to harm businesses and households, particularly low-income households. Participants stressed that they would need to see more data indicating that inflation pressures were abating to be more confident that infla- tion was on course to return to 2 percent over time. Participants noted that in recent months, financial con- ditions had tightened significantly because of a substan- tial run-up in longer-term Treasury yields, among other factors. Higher Treasury yields contributed to an in- crease in 30-year mortgage rates to levels not seen in many years and led to higher corporate borrowing rates. Many participants observed that a range of measures suggested that the rise in longer-term yields had been driven primarily or substantially by a rise in the term pre- miums on Treasury securities. Participants generally viewed factors such as a fiscal outlook that suggested greater future supply of Treasury securities than previ- ously thought and increased uncertainty about the eco- nomic and policy outlooks as likely having contributed to the rise in the term premiums. Some participants noted that the rise in longer-term yields may also have been driven by expectations for a higher path of the fed- eral funds rate in light of the surprising resilience of the economy or a possible rise in the neutral policy rate. Par- ticipants highlighted that longer-term yields could be volatile and that the factors behind the recent increase, as well as their persistence, were uncertain. However, they also noted that, whatever the source of the rise in longer-term yields, persistent changes in financial condi- tions could have implications for the path of monetary policy and that it would therefore be important to con- tinue to monitor market developments closely. Participants generally noted a high degree of uncertainty surrounding the economic outlook. As upside risks to economic activity, participants noted that the factors be- hind the resilience in spending could persist longer than expected. As downside risks, participants cited the pos- sibility that the effects on households and businesses of the cumulative policy tightening and tighter financial conditions could be larger than expected, disruptions from a potential government shutdown, and the possi- bility that the resumption of student loan repayments _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Minutes of the Meeting of October 31–November 1, 2023 Page 7 could weigh on household spending by more than was expected. As upside risks to inflation, participants cited the possibility that progress on disinflation stalls or in- flation reaccelerates because of continued momentum in economic activity. A potential for a broadening of the armed conflict in the Middle East was seen as presenting upside risk to inflation through its potential effect on oil prices as well as downside risk to economic activity. In their discussion of financial stability, participants ob- served that the banking system was sound and resilient and that banking stresses had subsided. However, many participants commented that unrealized losses on assets resulting from the rise in longer-term interest rates, sig- nificant reliance by some banks on uninsured deposits, and increased funding costs at banks warranted moni- toring. Many participants also commented on risks as- sociated with a potential sharp decline in CRE valua- tions, which could adversely affect some banks and other financial institutions. Several participants noted potential cyber risks and emphasized the importance of firms, particularly providers of critical infrastructure, be- ing prepared to recover from such threats. A few par- ticipants also discussed the importance of monitoring Treasury market functioning and potential vulnerabili- ties posed by the amount of leverage being used by hedge funds in this market. In addition, several partici- pants emphasized the need for banks to establish readi- ness to use Federal Reserve liquidity facilities and for the Federal Reserve to ensure its own readiness to provide liquidity during periods of stress. In their consideration of appropriate monetary policy ac- tions at this meeting, participants noted that economic activity expanded at a strong pace in the third quarter and had been resilient. While the labor market remained tight, job gains had moderated, on balance, since earlier in the year, and there were continuing signs that supply and demand in the labor market were coming into better balance. While inflation had moderated since the middle of last year, it remained well above the Committee’s longer-run goal of 2 percent, and participants remained resolute in their commitment to bring inflation down to the Committee’s 2 percent objective. Participants also noted that tighter financial and credit conditions facing households and businesses would likely weigh on eco- nomic activity, hiring, and inflation, although the extent of these effects remained uncertain. Participants com- mented on the significant tightening in financial condi- tions in recent months, driven by higher longer-term yields, with many noting that it was uncertain whether this tightening of financial conditions would persist and to what extent it reflected expectations for tighter policy or other factors. Amid these economic conditions, all participants judged it appropriate to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 5¼ to 5½ percent at this meeting. Participants judged that maintaining this restrictive stance of policy at this meeting would support further progress toward the Committee’s goals while al- lowing more time to gather additional information to evaluate this progress. All participants agreed that it was appropriate to continue the process of reducing the Fed- eral Reserve’s securities holdings, as described in the pre- viously announced Plans for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve’s Balance Sheet. In discussing the policy outlook, participants continued to judge that it was critical that the stance of monetary policy be kept sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to the Committee’s 2 percent objective over time. All participants agreed that the Committee was in a position to proceed carefully and that policy decisions at every meeting would continue to be based on the totality of incoming information and its implications for the eco- nomic outlook as well as the balance of risks. Partici- pants noted that further tightening of monetary policy would be appropriate if incoming information indicated that progress toward the Committee’s inflation objective was insufficient. Participants expected that the data ar- riving in coming months would help clarify the extent to which the disinflation process was continuing, aggregate demand was moderating in the face of tighter financial and credit conditions, and labor markets were reaching a better balance between demand and supply. Partici- pants noted the importance of continuing to communi- cate clearly about the Committee’s data-dependent ap- proach and its firm commitment to bring inflation down to 2 percent. All participants judged that it would be appropriate for policy to remain at a restrictive stance for some time un- til inflation is clearly moving down sustainably toward the Committee’s objective. Participants also observed that the continuing process of reducing the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet was an important part of the overall approach to achieving their macroeconomic objectives. A few participants noted that the process of balance sheet runoff could continue for some time, even after the Committee begins to reduce the target range for the federal funds rate. Several participants com- mented on the recent decline in the use of the ON RRP facility, noting that the use of the facility had been re- sponsive to market conditions. Page 8 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Participants discussed several risk-management consid- erations that could bear on future policy decisions. Par- ticipants generally judged that, with the stance of mone- tary policy in restrictive territory, risks to the achieve- ment of the Committee’s goals had become more two sided. But with inflation still well above the Committee’s longer-run goal and the labor market remaining tight, most participants continued to see upside risks to infla- tion. These risks included the possibility that the imbal- ance of aggregate demand and supply could persist longer than expected and slow the progress on inflation, geopolitical tensions and risks emanating from global oil markets, the effects of a tight housing market on shelter inflation, and the potential for more limited declines in goods prices. Many participants commented that even though economic activity had been resilient and the la- bor market had continued to be strong, downside risks to economic activity remained. Such risks included po- tentially larger-than-expected effects of the tightening in financial and credit conditions on aggregate demand and on bank, business, and household balance sheets; con- tinued weakness in the CRE sector; and potential disrup- tions to global oil markets. Committee Policy Actions In their discussion of monetary policy for this meeting, members agreed that economic activity had expanded at a strong pace in the third quarter, job gains had moder- ated since earlier in the year but remained strong, and the unemployment rate had remained low. Inflation had remained elevated. Members concurred that the U.S. banking system was sound and resilient. They also agreed that tighter finan- cial and credit conditions for households and businesses were likely to weigh on economic activity, hiring, and in- flation but that the extent of these effects was uncertain. Members agreed that they remained highly attentive to inflation risks. In support of the Committee’s objectives to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 per- cent over the longer run, members agreed to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 5¼ to 5½ percent. They also agreed that they would continue to assess additional information and its implications for monetary policy. In determining the extent of additional policy firming that may be appropriate to return inflation to 2 percent over time, members concurred that they would take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy af- fects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments. In addition, members agreed to continue to reduce the Federal Reserve’s holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and mortgage- backed securities, as described in its previously an- nounced plans. All members affirmed that they are strongly committed to returning inflation to their 2 per- cent objective. Members agreed that, in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, they would continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. They would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals. Mem- bers also agreed that their assessments would take into account a wide range of information, including readings on labor market conditions, inflation pressures and in- flation expectations, and financial and international de- velopments. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Open Market Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive, for release at 2:00 p.m.: “Effective November 2, 2023, the Federal Open Market Committee directs the Desk to: • Undertake open market operations as nec- essary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of 5¼ to 5½ percent. • Conduct standing overnight repurchase agreement operations with a minimum bid rate of 5.5 percent and with an aggregate operation limit of $500 billion. • Conduct standing overnight reverse repur- chase agreement operations at an offering rate of 5.3 percent and with a per-counter- party limit of $160 billion per day. • Roll over at auction the amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s hold- ings of Treasury securities maturing in each calendar month that exceeds a cap of $60 billion per month. Redeem Treasury coupon securities up to this monthly cap and Treasury bills to the extent that coupon principal payments are less than the monthly cap. • Reinvest into agency mortgage-backed se- curities (MBS) the amount of principal pay- ments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Minutes of the Meeting of October 31–November 1, 2023 Page 9 of agency debt and agency MBS received in each calendar month that exceeds a cap of $35 billion per month. • Allow modest deviations from stated amounts for reinvestments, if needed for operational reasons. • Engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settle- ment of the Federal Reserve’s agency MBS transactions.” The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below for release at 2:00 p.m.: “Recent indicators suggest that economic activ- ity expanded at a strong pace in the third quar- ter. Job gains have moderated since earlier in the year but remain strong, and the unemploy- ment rate has remained low. Inflation remains elevated. The U.S. banking system is sound and resilient. Tighter financial and credit conditions for households and businesses are likely to weigh on economic activity, hiring, and inflation. The extent of these effects remains uncertain. The Committee remains highly attentive to inflation risks. The Committee seeks to achieve maximum em- ployment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. In support of these goals, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 5¼ to 5½ percent. The Committee will continue to assess additional information and its implica- tions for monetary policy. In determining the extent of additional policy firming that may be appropriate to return inflation to 2 percent over time, the Committee will take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects eco- nomic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments. In addition, the Com- mittee will continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities, as described in its previously announced plans. The Committee is strongly committed to returning inflation to its 2 percent objective. In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals. The Committee’s assessments will take into account a wide range of information, in- cluding readings on labor market conditions, in- flation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.” Voting for this action: Jerome H. Powell, John C. Williams, Michael S. Barr, Michelle W. Bowman, Lisa D. Cook, Austan D. Goolsbee, Patrick Harker, Philip N. Jefferson, Neel Kashkari, Adriana D. Kugler, Lorie K. Logan, and Christopher J. Waller. Voting against this action: None. Consistent with the Committee’s decision to leave the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted unanimously to maintain the interest rate paid on reserve balances at 5.4 percent, effective Novem- ber 2, 2023. The Board of Governors of the Federal Re- serve System voted unanimously to approve the estab- lishment of the primary credit rate at the existing level of 5.5 percent, effective November 2, 2023. It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Tuesday–Wednesday, December 12– 13, 2023. The meeting adjourned at 10:05 a.m. on No- vember 1, 2023.

Finan- cial conditions eased, driven by a decline in interest rates, an increase in equity prices, and a depreciation in the dol- lar. The rise in equity prices was supported by the de- cline in Treasury yields and by earnings growth that ex- ceeded consensus expectations. Implied volatility for equities diminished notably. The easing in financial con- ditions reversed some of the tightening that occurred over the summer and much of the fall. Yields on nominal Treasury securities declined sharply over the intermeeting period—more so at longer matur- ities—after having increased notably during the previous intermeeting period, as investors appeared to interpret incoming data as reducing risks of prolonged inflation pressures. In addition, market participants interpreted communications from FOMC participants as solidifying Page 2 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ the view that the Committee’s policy rate may be at its peak. Early in the period, the market also reacted to communications from the Treasury Department indicat- ing that issuance of Treasury securities was likely to be more skewed toward shorter-dated maturities than pre- viously expected. Models, on average, suggested that about two-thirds of the decline in longer-term yields on Treasury securities over the period was attributable to a reduction in term premiums and about one-third to a decline in expectations for the policy rate. Pricing of in- flation derivatives over the intermeeting period sug- gested that investors had become more optimistic about the near-term outlook for inflation. The manager turned next to expectations for monetary policy. Respondents to the Open Market Desk’s Survey of Primary Dealers and Survey of Market Participants largely converged around the view that the peak level of the federal funds rate for this tightening cycle had been reached. The modal path from the Desk surveys sug- gested that the first reduction in the policy rate would occur in June, unchanged from the October surveys. The average path for the policy rate implied by market pricing shifted down considerably over the period. Regarding developments in money markets and Desk operations, usage of the overnight reverse repurchase agreement (ON RRP) facility continued to fall over the period; take-up at the facility had dropped about $1.3 trillion since early June. The decline was again driven primarily by lower participation by money market mutual funds, as such funds found it more attractive to invest in Treasury bills and, increasingly, the private mar- ket for repurchase agreement (repo) transactions. Overnight repo rates continued to experience some modest upward pressure over the period. As reflected by a rise in the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, there was some tightening of conditions in repo markets in late November and early December in response to typi- cal lending dynamics around month-end, the settlement of a large amount of Treasury issuance, and increased demand for Treasury financing. The market absorbed this episode well. The manager expected that private-market repo rates would likely remain above the rate offered at the ON RRP facility, which should continue to induce a re- duction in usage of the facility. Respondents to the Desk surveys again reduced their expectations for the trajec- tory for ON RRP balances and correspondingly raised their expectations for the trajectory of reserve balances. Aggregate reserves across the banking system remained abundant, and no signs of pressures were evident. As part of their ongoing market surveillance, the staff will continue to monitor a wide range of indicators of money market conditions, including the composition of bor- rowers in money markets, borrowing demand for vari- ous sources of liquidity, the distribution of reserve bal- ances across the financial system, the pricing of money market investments relative to the Federal Reserve’s ad- ministered rates, and the sensitivity of money market rates to changes in aggregate reserves. By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk’s domestic transactions over the intermeeting period. There were no intervention operations in foreign curren- cies for the System’s account during the intermeeting pe- riod. Staff Review of the Economic Situation The data available at the time of the December 12–13 meeting suggested that growth in U.S. real gross domes- tic product (GDP) was slowing from its strong third- quarter pace. Labor market conditions continued to be tight, with moderating but still-strong job gains and a low unemployment rate. Consumer price inflation had eased over the past year but remained elevated. Labor demand and supply continued to move gradually into better alignment. Total nonfarm payroll employ- ment expanded at a slower pace, on balance, over Octo- ber and November than its average monthly rate in the third quarter. The unemployment rate was little changed, on net, and stood at 3.7 percent in November, the same as its third-quarter average. The labor force participation rate was essentially flat over the past two months, remaining above its level early in the year, while the employment-to-population ratio rose slightly on bal- ance. The unemployment rates for African Americans and for Hispanics were little changed, and both rates were higher than those for Asians and for Whites. The job openings rate continued to trend down, and the quits rate was flat; both rates were below their levels earlier this year. The lessening of labor market imbalances was apparent in recent wage data, as the 12-month change in average hourly earnings for all employees was well below its year-earlier level and the Wage Growth Tracker con- structed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta was trending down and lower than a year ago. Consumer price inflation remained elevated but contin- ued to show notable signs of easing. The price index for total personal consumption expenditures (PCE) in- creased 3.0 percent over the 12 months ending in Octo- ber, while core PCE inflation—which excludes changes in energy prices and many consumer food prices—was 3.5 percent over the same period; both total and core Minutes of the Meeting of December 12–13, 2023 Page 3 _____________________________________________________________________________________________ PCE inflation were well below their year-earlier levels. The six-month change measures of total and core PCE inflation in October were each 2.5 percent, down from their levels six months earlier. The trimmed mean meas- ure of 12-month PCE inflation constructed by the Fed- eral Reserve Bank of Dallas was 3.6 percent in October, also down from its level a year ago. In November, the 12-month change in the consumer price index (CPI) was 3.1 percent, core CPI rose 4.0 percent over the same pe- riod, and both measures were well below their year-ear- lier levels. Recent survey measures of medium- to longer-term inflation expectations were in the range seen in the decade before the pandemic. In contrast, survey measures of consumers’ short-run inflation expectations remained above their pre-pandemic levels. Available indicators suggested that real GDP growth was slowing from its strong third-quarter pace, which had been led by a sizable increase in consumer spending. In October, PCE growth slowed from its average monthly rate in the third quarter. As for business invest- ment, nominal shipments of nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft were essentially flat in October, al- though nonresidential construction spending by busi- nesses edged up. Residential housing starts moved mostly sideways, and home sales continued to fall. Man- ufacturing production declined in October, and factory output was weak, even after excluding the decrease in motor vehicle assemblies caused by the autoworkers’ strike. The nominal trade deficit widened in October, as exports declined and imports rose slightly. Foreign economic growth slowed in the third quarter, and available indicators pointed to subdued growth in the fourth quarter. The significant tightening of mone- tary policy by foreign central banks over the past two years and the repercussions of last year’s energy shock in Europe continued to weigh on foreign economic activ- ity. Chinese economic indicators, such as retail sales and industrial production, pointed to economic growth re- maining modest. By contrast, economic activity in Asia excluding China stepped up, supported in part by a re- covery in industrial production, especially in the high- tech sector. While inflation was still elevated in most major econo- mies, incoming data indicated that it had moved down markedly. These decreases reflected notable step-downs in both energy and core inflation amid slowing aggregate demand and declines in oil prices. Most major foreign central banks kept their policy rates unchanged over the intermeeting period and emphasized the need to main- tain a sufficiently restrictive stance of policy to ensure that inflation fell back to their targets. Staff Review of the Financial Situation Over the intermeeting period, some softer-than-ex- pected data releases appeared to lessen the perception among investors that policy may need to tighten further in order to bring inflation down to 2 percent over time. Market participants also viewed monetary policy com- munications, on balance, as pointing to somewhat less restrictive policy than expected. As a result, nominal Treasury yields declined significantly and the expected market-implied path for the federal funds rate beyond the next few months shifted downward. Meanwhile, broad equity price indexes were boosted by many of the same factors that lowered Treasury yields, and spreads on investment- and speculative-grade corporate bonds narrowed. Financing conditions remained moderately restrictive, as borrowing costs remained elevated despite declining over the intermeeting period. The market-implied path for the federal funds rate be- yond the next few months moved down notably over the intermeeting period. A straight read of federal funds fu- tures rates suggested that market participants expected the federal funds rate to be 25 basis points below its cur- rent level by the May 2024 FOMC meeting, two meet- ings earlier than at the time of the October–November FOMC meeting. The policy rate path implied by over- night index swap quotes moved down 45 basis points to 4.2 percent by the end of 2024. Similarly, nominal Treas- ury yields declined significantly. The decline in nominal yields mostly reflected a decrease in real yields, while measures of inflation compensation were moderately lower, on net, amid softer-than-expected data releases. Measures of uncertainty about the path of interest rates decreased notably, consistent with the tempering of con- cerns about inflation, but remained elevated by historical standards. Broad stock price indexes increased markedly over the intermeeting period, and spreads on investment-grade bonds narrowed moderately, while those on speculative- grade corporate bonds declined more notably. The one- month option-implied volatility on the S&P 500 de- creased moderately and reached its lowest level since January 2020. Spillovers from falling U.S. yields, below-expectations readings on global inflation, and oil price drops led to large declines in foreign yields. These declines were ac- companied by an improvement in market sentiment, with foreign equity prices increasing, foreign credit Page 4 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ spreads narrowing, and outflows from funds investing in emerging market economies slowing notably. The im- provement in sentiment and declines in U.S. yields con- tributed to a broad depreciation of the foreign exchange value of the dollar. Conditions in U.S. short-term funding markets remained largely stable over the intermeeting period. Usage of the ON RRP facility continued to decline over the period. The decline in usage primarily reflected money market mutual funds reallocating their assets to Treasury bills and private-market repo, which offered slightly more at- tractive market rates relative to the ON RRP rate amid continued increases in net Treasury bill issuance and Federal Reserve balance sheet reduction. Banks’ total deposit levels were roughly unchanged over the inter- meeting period, as outflows of core deposits were about offset by inflows of large time deposits. In domestic credit markets, borrowing costs for most businesses, households, and municipalities declined over the intermeeting period, reflecting both lower longer- maturity Treasury yields and narrower credit spreads, al- though borrowing costs remained significantly elevated. Rates on loans to households, including those for 30-year conforming residential mortgages and new auto loans, declined over the intermeeting period, while inter- est rates on commercial and industrial (C&I) loans and small business loans were little changed. Yields on cor- porate bonds fell more than Treasury yields, particularly for speculative-grade bonds. Bank credit conditions appeared to tighten somewhat over the intermeeting period, but credit to businesses and households generally remained accessible. C&I loan balances contracted through November, on balance, while expansion of commercial real estate (CRE) loans stepped down appreciably across most categories from an already moderating pace in the third quarter. Credit remained available for most consumers, although consumer credit flows softened in recent months. Growth of credit card balances moderated significantly through November from the brisk pace seen in the sum- mer. For residential real estate borrowers, credit availa- bility was little changed. Credit conditions for small businesses appeared to have tightened further in recent months. Data from the Federal Reserve’s Small Busi- ness Lending Survey showed that originations had been roughly flat since mid-2022 before ticking down in the third quarter. Credit continued to be generally accessible through capital markets, although issuance was slow in many markets, including those for corporate bonds, lev- eraged loans, and agency and non-agency commercial mortgage-based securities (CMBS). Credit quality remained broadly solid but deteriorated further for some sectors in recent months. Delinquency rates on nonfarm nonresidential CRE bank loans rose further in the third quarter, and delinquency rates for construction and land development as well as multifam- ily loans ticked up. After increases over the first three quarters of the year, delinquency rates for loans in CMBS pools edged lower in October, but the large volume of loans scheduled to mature over the next few quarters suggested that delinquencies would likely surge again. The delinquency rate for small business loans continued to tick up in September and was above levels observed just before the pandemic. Credit card delinquency rates also increased further, while delinquency rates on auto loans were little changed in the third quarter. The trail- ing default rates for investment- and speculative-grade corporate bonds were little changed on net, and the trail- ing default rate for leveraged loans increased a bit. Staff Economic Outlook The economic forecast prepared by the staff for the De- cember meeting was broadly similar to the projection for the previous meeting. The staff continued to expect that GDP growth would slow markedly in the fourth quarter from its outsized third-quarter rate but that economic growth for 2023 as a whole would still be solid. The lagged effects of earlier monetary policy actions, through their contributions to continued tight financial and credit conditions, were expected to show through more fully in restraining economic activity in the coming years. Real GDP was projected to increase more slowly than the staff’s estimate of potential over the next two years be- fore rising in line with potential in 2026. The unemploy- ment rate was expected to be roughly flat through 2026 as the effects of below-potential output growth were off- set by the effects of further improvements in labor mar- ket functioning. The staff revised down their inflation forecast, reflecting lower-than-expected incoming data—including the No- vember CPI and producer price index—and their judg- ment that inflation would be less persistent than in the previous projection. Measured on a four-quarter change basis, total PCE price inflation was expected to be some- what below 3 percent this year, with core PCE price in- flation somewhat above 3 percent. Inflation was pro- jected to move lower in coming years as demand and supply in product and labor markets moved into better Minutes of the Meeting of December 12–13, 2023 Page 5 _____________________________________________________________________________________________ alignment; by 2026, total and core PCE price inflation were expected to be close to 2 percent. The staff continued to view uncertainty around the base- line projection as elevated, although they observed that the volatility of incoming data and staff forecast errors generally had become less pronounced over the past year. Risks around the inflation forecast were seen as skewed to the upside, given that inflation was still ele- vated and the possibility that inflation might prove to be more persistent than expected or that adverse shocks to supply conditions might occur. The risks around the forecast for economic activity were viewed to be tilted to the downside. In particular, the additional monetary policy tightening that could be put in place if upside in- flation risks were to materialize, with the potential for a greater tightening of financial conditions, represented a downside risk to the projection for economic activity. Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, participants submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and infla- tion for each year from 2023 through 2026 and over the longer run. The projections were based on their individ- ual assessments of appropriate monetary policy, includ- ing the path of the federal funds rate. The longer-run projections represented each participant’s assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy. A Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) was released to the public following the conclusion of the meeting. In their discussion of current economic conditions, par- ticipants observed that after stronger than expected growth of real GDP in the third quarter, recent indica- tors suggested that growth in economic activity had slowed. While still strong, job gains had moderated since earlier this year, and the unemployment rate had re- mained low. Participants observed that inflation had eased over the past year but remained elevated and above the Committee’s longer-run goal of 2 percent. Regarding the economic outlook, participants generally judged that, in 2024, real GDP growth would cool and that rebalancing of the labor market would continue, with the unemployment rate rising somewhat from its current level. Based on better-than-expected data on in- flation, participants revised down their inflation projec- tions for 2023 and, to a lesser extent, in subsequent years. Participants judged that the current stance of monetary policy was restrictive and appeared to be re- straining economic activity and inflation. In light of the policy restraint in place, along with more favorable data on inflation, participants generally viewed risks to infla- tion and employment as moving toward greater balance. However, participants remained highly attentive to infla- tion risks. In their discussion of inflation, all participants observed that clear progress had been made in 2023 toward the Committee’s 2 percent inflation objective. They re- mained concerned that elevated inflation continued to harm households, especially those with limited means to absorb higher prices. Participants observed that infla- tion remained above the Committee’s objective and that they would need to see more evidence that inflation pressures were abating to become confident in a sus- tained return of inflation to 2 percent. In reviewing progress to date in reducing inflation, par- ticipants noted the improvement in both headline and core inflation and discussed the developments in com- ponents of these aggregate measures. They observed that progress had been uneven across components, with energy and core goods prices falling or changing little recently, but core services prices still increasing at an el- evated pace. Several participants observed that the on- going rebalancing of labor supply and demand would help reduce core services inflation. Several participants assessed that housing services inflation would fall fur- ther over time as the earlier deceleration in rents on new leases continued to pass through to broader rent measures. Participants also discussed the role played by various supply and demand factors in the progress on reducing inflation thus far. They assessed that the con- tribution of improved supply had come from supply chain normalization, boosts to labor supply due to a higher labor force participation rate and immigration, better productivity growth, or increased domestic oil production. They also noted that restrictive monetary policy had helped restrain growth of demand, particu- larly in interest-sensitive sectors such as business fixed investment, housing, and autos and other durable goods. Several participants assessed that healing in supply chains and labor supply was largely complete, and there- fore that continued progress in reducing inflation may need to come mainly from further softening in product and labor demand, with restrictive monetary policy con- tinuing to play a central role. A few others saw potential for further improvements in supply. Several participants noted that longer-term inflation expectations remained well anchored and that near-term inflation expectations of households had declined recently. Page 6 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ In their comments about the household sector, partici- pants observed that consumer spending had been strong, supported by the healthy balance sheets of many households, a strong labor market, and robust income growth. Retail sales growth had stepped down noticea- bly in October, though a few participants remarked that contacts reported strong sales in November, notably re- lated to holiday spending. Participants mentioned sev- eral factors that may contribute to softer consumer spending, including slower growth of labor income and diminishing pandemic-related excess savings. Relatedly, many participants noted increased usage of credit by households, including from credit cards, buy-now-pay- later borrowing, and payday loans, as well as increased delinquency rates for many types of consumer loans. Reports from participants’ business-sector contacts were mixed, with some contacts remaining relatively optimis- tic and others expecting slower growth for 2024. Several participants observed that higher interest rates were leading firms to reassess future projects and were con- tributing to softer business investment and hiring. A couple of participants commented on small businesses, noting that such businesses were experiencing tighter credit conditions and increasing delinquencies. A few participants noted that contacts in manufacturing re- ported slowing growth, while a couple of participants ex- pected that low prices for some commodities and drought conditions would reduce agricultural incomes this year. Regarding concerns about CRE, several par- ticipants noted that a significant share of properties would need to be refinanced in 2024 against a backdrop of higher interest rates, continued weakness in the office sector, and balance sheet pressures faced by some lend- ers. Participants assessed that while the labor market re- mained tight, it continued to come into better balance. Many noted that nominal wage growth had continued to slow broadly and that business contacts expected a fur- ther reduction in wage growth. A few participants ob- served that payroll growth had slowed substantially since the beginning of the year. Some participants remarked that their contacts reported larger applicant pools for va- cancies, and some participants highlighted that the ratio of vacancies to unemployed workers had declined to a value only modestly above its level just before the pan- demic. Participants viewed improvements in labor sup- ply and the easing of labor demand as both having con- tributed to the labor market coming into better balance. Supply had improved because of higher labor force par- ticipation and immigration, with continued solid produc- tivity growth also supporting the productive capacity of the economy. As evidence for the softening of the growth of labor demand during 2023, many participants noted the decline in job openings, and a few remarked on the lower quits rate. Several participants noted the risk that, if labor demand were to weaken substantially further, the labor market could transition quickly from a gradual easing to a more abrupt downshift in conditions. Participants generally perceived a high degree of uncer- tainty surrounding the economic outlook. As an upside risk to both inflation and economic activity, participants noted that the momentum of economic activity may be stronger than currently assessed, possibly on account of the continued balance sheet strength of many house- holds. Furthermore, participants observed that, after a sharp tightening since the summer, financial conditions had eased over the intermeeting period. Many partici- pants remarked that an easing in financial conditions be- yond what is appropriate could make it more difficult for the Committee to reach its inflation goal. Participants also noted other sources of upside risks to inflation, in- cluding possible effects on global energy and food prices of geopolitical developments, a potential rebound in core goods prices following the period of supply chain improvements, or the effects of nearshoring and on- shoring activities on labor demand and inflation. Down- side risks to economic activity noted by participants in- cluded the possibility that effects of past policy tighten- ing may be larger than expected, the risk of a marked weakening of household balance sheets, possible nega- tive spillovers from lower growth in some foreign econ- omies, geopolitical risks, and lingering risks of further tightening in bank credit. Relatedly, several participants noted that the weakness in gross domestic income growth relative to GDP growth over the past few quar- ters may suggest that economic momentum during that period was not as strong as indicated by the GDP read- ings. In their consideration of appropriate monetary policy ac- tions at this meeting, participants noted that recent indi- cators suggested that growth of economic activity had slowed from its strong pace in the third quarter. Job gains had moderated since earlier in the year but re- mained strong, the unemployment rate had remained low, and there were continuing signs that supply and de- mand in the labor market were coming into better bal- ance. Inflation had eased over the past year but re- mained elevated. Participants also noted that tighter fi- nancial and credit conditions facing households and businesses would likely weigh on economic activity, hir- ing, and inflation, although the extent of these effects Minutes of the Meeting of December 12–13, 2023 Page 7 _____________________________________________________________________________________________ remained uncertain. Participants continued to be reso- lute in their commitment to bring inflation down to the Committee’s 2 percent objective. In light of current economic conditions and their impli- cations for the outlook for economic activity and infla- tion, as well as the balance of risks, all participants judged it appropriate to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 5¼ to 5½ percent at this meeting. All par- ticipants also agreed that it was appropriate to continue the process of reducing the Federal Reserve’s securities holdings, as described in the previously announced Plans for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve’s Balance Sheet. Participants assessed that maintaining the current policy stance was supported by intermeeting data indicating that inflation had continued to move toward the Com- mittee’s 2 percent objective and that the labor market had continued to move into better balance. They judged that maintaining the target range for the federal funds rate at this meeting would promote further progress to- ward the Committee’s goals and allow participants more time to gather additional information to evaluate this progress. In discussing the policy outlook, participants viewed the policy rate as likely at or near its peak for this tightening cycle, though they noted that the actual policy path will depend on how the economy evolves. Participants pointed to the decline in inflation seen during 2023, not- ing the recent shift down in six-month inflation readings in particular, and to growing signs of demand and supply coming into better balance in product and labor markets as informing that view. Several participants remarked that the Committee’s past policy actions were having their intended effect of helping to slow the growth of aggregate demand and cool labor market conditions. They judged that, in combination with improvements in the supply situation, these developments were helping to bring inflation back to 2 percent over time. Most partic- ipants noted that, as indicated in their submissions to the SEP, they expected the Committee’s restrictive policy stance to continue to soften household and business spending, helping to promote further reductions in in- flation over the next few years. In their submitted projections, almost all participants in- dicated that, reflecting the improvements in their infla- tion outlooks, their baseline projections implied that a lower target range for the federal funds rate would be appropriate by the end of 2024. Participants also noted, however, that their outlooks were associated with an un- usually elevated degree of uncertainty and that it was possible that the economy could evolve in a manner that would make further increases in the target range appro- priate. Several also observed that circumstances might warrant keeping the target range at its current value for longer than they currently anticipated. Participants gen- erally stressed the importance of maintaining a careful and data-dependent approach to making monetary pol- icy decisions and reaffirmed that it would be appropriate for policy to remain at a restrictive stance for some time until inflation was clearly moving down sustainably to- ward the Committee’s objective. Participants discussed several risk-management consid- erations that could bear on future policy decisions. Par- ticipants saw upside risks to inflation as having dimin- ished but noted that inflation was still well above the Committee’s longer-run goal and that a risk remained that progress toward price stability would stall. A num- ber of participants highlighted the uncertainty associated with how long a restrictive monetary policy stance would need to be maintained, and pointed to the downside risks to the economy that would be associated with an overly restrictive stance. A few suggested that the Com- mittee potentially could face a tradeoff between its dual- mandate goals in the period ahead. Participants observed that the continuing process of re- ducing the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet was an important part of the Committee’s overall ap- proach to achieving its macroeconomic objectives and that balance sheet runoff had so far proceeded smoothly. Several participants noted that, amid the ongoing bal- ance sheet normalization, there had been a further de- cline over the intermeeting period in use of the ON RRP facility and that this reduced usage largely reflected port- folio shifts by money market mutual funds toward higher-yielding investments, including Treasury bills and private-market repo. Several participants remarked that the Committee’s balance sheet plans indicated that it would slow and then stop the decline in the size of the balance sheet when reserve balances are somewhat above the level judged consistent with ample reserves. These participants suggested that it would be appropri- ate for the Committee to begin to discuss the technical factors that would guide a decision to slow the pace of runoff well before such a decision was reached in order to provide appropriate advance notice to the public. Committee Policy Actions In their discussions of monetary policy for this meeting, members agreed that recent indicators suggested that growth of economic activity had slowed from its strong pace in the third quarter. Job gains had moderated since Page 8 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ earlier in the year but remained strong, and the unem- ployment rate had remained low. Inflation had eased over the past year but remained elevated. Members concurred that the U.S. banking system was sound and resilient. They also agreed that tighter finan- cial and credit conditions for households and businesses were likely to weigh on economic activity, hiring, and in- flation but that the extent of these effects was uncertain. Members agreed that they remained highly attentive to inflation risks. In support of the Committee’s objective to achieve max- imum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run, members agreed to maintain the tar- get range for the federal funds rate at 5¼ to 5½ percent. They also agreed that they would continue to assess ad- ditional information and its implications for monetary policy. In determining the extent of any additional pol- icy firming that may be appropriate to return inflation to 2 percent over time, members concurred that they would take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects eco- nomic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments. In addition, members agreed to continue to reduce the Federal Reserve’s holdings of Treasury se- curities and agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities, as described in its previously announced plans. All members affirmed their strong commitment to returning inflation to their 2 percent objective. Members agreed that, in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, they would continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. They would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals. Mem- bers also agreed that their assessments would take into account a wide range of information, including readings on labor market conditions, inflation pressures and in- flation expectations, and financial and international de- velopments. Members agreed that their postmeeting statement should acknowledge the slowing of economic activity from its strong pace in the third quarter as well as the fact that inflation had eased over the past year but re- mained elevated. Members also agreed to modify the sentence in their postmeeting statement discussing the considerations relevant for future policy actions to indi- cate that the Committee would determine “the extent of any additional policy firming that may be appropriate to return inflation to 2 percent over time.” Members gen- erally viewed the addition of the word “any” to this sen- tence as appropriately relaying their judgment that the target range for the federal funds rate was likely now at or near its peak for this policy tightening cycle while leaving open the possibility of further increases in the target range if these were warranted by the totality of the incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Open Market Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive, for release at 2:00 p.m.: “Effective December 14, 2023, the Federal Open Market Committee directs the Desk to: • Undertake open market operations as nec- essary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of 5¼ to 5½ percent. • Conduct standing overnight repurchase agreement operations with a minimum bid rate of 5.5 percent and with an aggregate operation limit of $500 billion. • Conduct standing overnight reverse repur- chase agreement operations at an offering rate of 5.3 percent and with a per-counter- party limit of $160 billion per day. • Roll over at auction the amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s hold- ings of Treasury securities maturing in each calendar month that exceeds a cap of $60 billion per month. Redeem Treasury coupon securities up to this monthly cap and Treasury bills to the extent that coupon principal payments are less than the monthly cap. • Reinvest into agency mortgage-backed se- curities (MBS) the amount of principal pay- ments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of agency debt and agency MBS received in each calendar month that exceeds a cap of $35 billion per month. • Allow modest deviations from stated amounts for reinvestments, if needed for operational reasons. Minutes of the Meeting of December 12–13, 2023 Page 9 _____________________________________________________________________________________________ • Engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settle- ment of the Federal Reserve’s agency MBS transactions.” The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below for release at 2:00 p.m.: “Recent indicators suggest that growth of eco- nomic activity has slowed from its strong pace in the third quarter. Job gains have moderated since earlier in the year but remain strong, and the unemployment rate has remained low. In- flation has eased over the past year but remains elevated. The U.S. banking system is sound and resilient. Tighter financial and credit conditions for households and businesses are likely to weigh on economic activity, hiring, and inflation. The extent of these effects remains uncertain. The Committee remains highly attentive to inflation risks. The Committee seeks to achieve maximum em- ployment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. In support of these goals, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 5¼ to 5½ percent. The Committee will continue to assess additional information and its implica- tions for monetary policy. In determining the extent of any additional policy firming that may be appropriate to return inflation to 2 percent over time, the Committee will take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects eco- nomic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments. In addition, the Com- mittee will continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities, as described in its previously announced plans. The Committee is strongly committed to returning inflation to its 2 percent objective. In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals. The Committee’s assessments will take into account a wide range of information, in- cluding readings on labor market conditions, in- flation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.” Voting for this action: Jerome H.

AUTHORIZATION FOR DOMESTIC OPEN MARKET OPERATIONS (As reaffirmed effective January 25, 2022) OPEN MARKET TRANSACTIONS 1. The Federal Open Market Committee (the “Com- mittee”) authorizes and directs the Federal Reserve Bank selected by the Committee to execute open market trans- actions (the “Selected Bank”), to the extent necessary to carry out the most recent domestic policy directive adopted by the Committee: A. To buy or sell in the open market securities that are direct obligations of, or fully guaranteed as to prin- cipal and interest by, the United States, and securities that are direct obligations of, or fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, any agency of the United States, that are eligible for purchase or sale under Sec- tion 14(b) of the Federal Reserve Act (“Eligible Secu- rities”) for the System Open Market Account (“SOMA”): i. As an outright operation with securities dealers and foreign and international accounts maintained at the Selected Bank: on a same-day or deferred de- livery basis (including such transactions as are com- monly referred to as dollar rolls and coupon swaps) at market prices; or ii. As a temporary operation: on a same-day or deferred delivery basis, to purchase such Eligible Se- curities subject to an agreement to resell (“repo transactions”) or to sell such Eligible Securities sub- ject to an agreement to repurchase (“reverse repo transactions”) for a term of 65 business days or less, at rates that, unless otherwise authorized by the Committee, are determined by competitive bidding, after applying reasonable limitations on the volume of agreements with individual counterparties; B. To allow Eligible Securities in the SOMA to ma- ture without replacement; C. To exchange, at market prices, in connection with a Treasury auction, maturing Eligible Securities in the SOMA with the Treasury, in the case of Eligible Securities that are direct obligations of the United States or that are fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by the United States; and D. To exchange, at market prices, maturing Eligible Securities in the SOMA with an agency of the United States, in the case of Eligible Securities that are direct obligations of that agency or that are fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by that agency. SECURITIES LENDING 2. In order to ensure the effective conduct of open market operations, the Committee authorizes the Se- lected Bank to operate a program to lend Eligible Secu- rities held in the SOMA to dealers on an overnight basis (except that the Selected Bank may lend Eligible Securi- ties for longer than an overnight term to accommodate weekend, holiday, and similar trading conventions). A. Such securities lending must be: i. At rates determined by competitive bidding; ii. At a minimum lending fee consistent with the objectives of the program; _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Minutes of the Meeting of January 25–26, 2022 Page 3 iii. Subject to reasonable limitations on the total amount of a specific issue of Eligible Securities that may be auctioned; and iv. Subject to reasonable limitations on the amount of Eligible Securities that each borrower may borrow. B. The Selected Bank may: i. Reject bids that, as determined in its sole dis- cretion, could facilitate a bidder’s ability to control a single issue; ii. Accept Treasury securities or cash as collateral for any loan of securities authorized in this para- graph 2; and iii. Accept agency securities as collateral only for a loan of agency securities authorized in this para- graph 2. OPERATIONAL READINESS TESTING 3. The Committee authorizes the Selected Bank to undertake transactions of the type described in para- graphs 1 and 2 from time to time for the purpose of test- ing operational readiness, subject to the following limi- tations: A. All transactions authorized in this paragraph 3 shall be conducted with prior notice to the Commit- tee; B. The aggregate par value of the transactions au- thorized in this paragraph 3 that are of the type de- scribed in paragraph 1.A.i, 1.B, 1.C and 1.D shall not exceed $5 billion per calendar year; and C. The outstanding amount of the transactions de- scribed in paragraphs 1.A.ii and 2 shall not exceed $5 billion at any given time. TRANSACTIONS WITH CUSTOMER ACCOUNTS 4. In order to ensure the effective conduct of open market operations, while assisting in the provision of short-term investments or other authorized services for foreign central bank and international accounts main- tained at a Federal Reserve Bank (the “Foreign Ac- counts”) and accounts maintained at a Federal Reserve Bank as fiscal agent of the United States pursuant to sec- tion 15 of the Federal Reserve Act (together with the Foreign Accounts, the “Customer Accounts”), the Com- mittee authorizes the following when undertaken on terms comparable to those available in the open market: A. The Selected Bank, for the SOMA, to: i. Undertake reverse repo transactions in Eligible Securities held in the SOMA with the Customer Ac- counts for a term of 65 business days or less; and ii. Undertake repo transactions in Eligible Securi- ties with Foreign Accounts; and B. Any Federal Reserve Bank that maintains Cus- tomer Accounts, for any such Customer Account, when appropriate and subject to all other necessary authorization and approvals, to: i. Undertake repo transactions in Eligible Securi- ties with dealers with a corresponding reverse repo transaction in such Eligible Securities with the Cus- tomer Accounts; and ii. Undertake intra-day repo transactions in Eligi- ble Securities with Foreign Accounts. Transactions undertaken with Customer Accounts un- der the provisions of this paragraph 4 may provide for a service fee when appropriate. Transactions undertaken with Customer Accounts are also subject to the authori- zation or approval of other entities, including the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and, when involving accounts maintained at a Federal Reserve Bank as fiscal agent of the United States, the United States Department of the Treasury. ADDITIONAL MATTERS 5. The Committee authorizes the Chair of the Com- mittee, in fostering the Committee’s objectives during any period between meetings of the Committee, to in- struct the Selected Bank to act on behalf of the Commit- tee to: A. Adjust somewhat in exceptional circumstances the stance of monetary policy and to take actions that may result in material changes in the composition and size of the assets in the SOMA; or B. Undertake transactions with respect to Eligible Securities in order to appropriately address temporary disruptions of an operational or highly unusual nature in U.S. dollar funding markets. Any such adjustment described in subparagraph A of this paragraph 5 shall be made in the context of the Committee’s discussion and decision about the stance of policy at its most recent meeting and the Committee’s long-run objectives to foster maximum employment and price stability, and shall be based on economic, financial, and monetary developments since the most recent meet- ing of the Committee. The Chair, whenever feasible, will consult with the Committee before making any instruc- tion under this paragraph 5.

STANDALONE SPOT AND FORWARD TRANS- ACTIONS 3. For any operation that involves standalone spot or forward transactions in foreign currencies: A. Approval of such operation is required as fol- lows: i. The Committee must direct the Selected Bank in advance to execute the operation if it would result in the overall volume of standalone spot and for- ward transactions in foreign currencies, as defined in paragraph 3.C of this Authorization, exceeding $5 billion since the close of the most recent regular meeting of the Committee. The Foreign Currency Subcommittee (the “Subcommittee”) must direct the Selected Bank in advance to execute the opera- tion if the Subcommittee believes that consultation with the Committee is not feasible in the time avail- able. ii. The Committee authorizes the Subcommittee to direct the Selected Bank in advance to execute the operation if it would result in the overall volume of standalone spot and forward transactions in foreign currencies, as defined in paragraph 3.C of this Au- thorization, totaling $5 billion or less since the close of the most recent regular meeting of the Commit- tee. B. Such an operation also shall be: i. Generally directed at countering disorderly market conditions; or ii. Undertaken to adjust System balances in light of probable future needs for currencies; or iii. Conducted for such other purposes as may be determined by the Committee. C. For purposes of this Authorization, the overall volume of standalone spot and forward transactions in foreign currencies is defined as the sum (disregard- ing signs) of the dollar values of individual foreign cur- rencies purchased and sold, valued at the time of the transaction. WAREHOUSING 4. The Committee authorizes the Selected Bank, with the prior approval of the Subcommittee and at the re- quest of the United States Treasury, to conduct swap transactions with the United States Exchange Stabiliza- tion Fund established by section 10 of the Gold Reserve Act of 1934 under agreements in which the Selected Bank purchases foreign currencies from the Exchange Stabilization Fund and the Exchange Stabilization Fund repurchases the foreign currencies from the Selected _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Minutes of the Meeting of January 25–26, 2022 Page 5 Bank at a later date (such purchases and sales also known as warehousing). RECIPROCAL CURRENCY ARRANGEMENTS, AND STANDING DOLLAR AND FOREIGN CUR- RENCY LIQUIDITY SWAPS 5. The Committee authorizes the Selected Bank to maintain reciprocal currency arrangements established under the North American Framework Agreement, standing dollar liquidity swap arrangements, temporary dollar liquidity swap arrangements, and standing foreign currency liquidity swap arrangements as provided in this Authorization and to the extent necessary to carry out any foreign currency directive of the Committee.

B. For standing and temporary dollar liquidity swap arrangements all drawings must be approved in ad- vance by the Chair. The Chair may approve a schedule of potential drawings, and may delegate to the man- ager, System Open Market Account, the authority to approve individual drawings that occur according to the schedule approved by the Chair. C. For standing foreign currency liquidity swap ar- rangements all drawings must be approved in advance by the Committee (or by the Subcommittee, if the Subcommittee believes that consultation with the Committee is not feasible in the time available). D. Operations involving standing and temporary dollar liquidity swap arrangements and standing for- eign currency liquidity swap arrangements shall gener- ally be directed at countering strains in financial mar- kets in the United States or abroad, or reducing the risk that they could emerge, so as to mitigate their ef- fects on economic and financial conditions in the United States. E. For reciprocal currency arrangements, standing and temporary dollar liquidity swap arrangements, and standing foreign currency liquidity swap arrangements: i. All arrangements are subject to annual review and approval by the Committee; ii. Any new arrangements must be approved by the Committee; and iii.

These obligations include seeking to direct the member’s economic and financial policies toward the objective of fostering orderly economic growth with reasonable price stability. These obligations also include avoiding manipulating exchange rates or the international monetary system in such a way that would impede effective balance of payments adjustment or to give an unfair competitive advantage over other members.

Standing foreign currency liquidity swap arrange- ments with the following foreign central banks: Bank of Canada Bank of England Bank of Japan European Central Bank Swiss National Bank 4. The Committee directs the Selected Bank to hold and to invest foreign currencies in the portfolio in ac- cordance with the provisions of paragraph 7 of the Au- thorization. 5. The Committee directs the Selected Bank to report to the Committee, at each regular meeting of the Com- mittee, on transactions undertaken pursuant to para- graphs 1 and 6 of the Authorization. The Selected Bank is also directed to provide quarterly reports to the Com- mittee regarding the management of the foreign cur- rency holdings pursuant to paragraph 7 of the Authori- zation. 6. The Committee directs the Selected Bank to con- duct testing of transactions for the purpose of opera- tional readiness in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 9 of the Authorization. The Committee voted unanimously to approve with minor revisions the Standing Repurchase Agreement Fa- cility Resolution, as shown below. All but one member of the Committee voted to approve with minor revisions the Standing FIMA Repurchase Agreement Resolution. Governor Bowman abstained from the vote on the Standing FIMA Repurchase Agreement Resolution. The resolutions were modified to remove references to a specific facility rate to allow for normal adjustment in the facility rates when the Committee makes changes to the target range for the federal funds rate. STANDING REPURCHASE AGREEMENT FACIL- ITY RESOLUTION (As amended effective January 25, 2022) The Federal Open Market Committee (the “Commit- tee”) authorizes and directs the Open Market Desk at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (the “Selected Bank”), for the System Open Market Account (“SOMA”), to conduct operations in which it offers to purchase securities, subject to an agreement to resell (“repurchase agreement transactions”). The repurchase agreement transactions hereby authorized and directed shall (i) include only U.S. Treasury securities, agency debt securities, and agency mortgage-backed securities; (ii) be conducted as open market operations with pri- mary dealers and depository institutions as participants; (iii) be conducted with a minimum bid rate set at a level directed by the Committee; (iv) be offered on an over- night basis (except that the Open Market Desk at the Selected Bank may extend the term for longer than an overnight term to accommodate weekend, holiday, and similar trading conventions); and (v) be subject to an ag- gregate operation limit of $500 billion. The aggregate operation limit can be temporarily increased at the dis- cretion of the Chair. These operations shall be con- ducted by the Open Market Desk at the Selected Bank until otherwise directed by the Committee. STANDING FIMA REPURCHASE AGREEMENT RESOLUTION (As amended effective January 25, 2022) The Federal Open Market Committee (the “Commit- tee”) authorizes and directs the Open Market Desk at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (the “Selected Bank”), for the System Open Market Account (“SOMA”), to offer to purchase U.S. Treasury securities subject to an agreement to resell (“repurchase agreement transactions”) with foreign central bank and interna- tional accounts maintained at a Federal Reserve Bank (the “Foreign Accounts”). The repurchase agreement transactions hereby authorized and directed shall (i) in- clude only U.S. Treasury securities; (ii) be conducted with Foreign Accounts approved in advance by the For- eign Currency Subcommittee (the ”Subcommittee”); (iii) be conducted at an offering rate equal to the minimum bid rate for the standing repurchase agreement facility unless the Subcommittee establishes a different offering rate; (iv) be offered on an overnight basis (except that the Open Market Desk at the Selected Bank may extend the term for longer than an overnight term to accommo- date weekend, holiday, and similar trading conventions); and (v) be subject to a per-counterparty limit of $60 bil- lion per day. The Subcommittee may approve changes in the offering rate, the maturity of the transactions, eli- gible Foreign Accounts counterparties (either by ap- proving or removing account access), and the counter- party limit; and the Subcommittee shall keep the Com- mittee informed of any such changes. These transac- tions shall be undertaken by the Open Market Desk at the Selected Bank until otherwise directed by the Com- mittee. The Open Market Desk at the Selected Bank will also report at least annually to the Committee on facility usage and the list of approved account holders. Regarding the tough and comprehensive ethics rules for senior officials that were announced in October, the Chair indicated that staff were working through com- ments received from policymakers and were aiming to Page 8 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ circulate a new draft soon. Noting the urgency in bring- ing the new policy to completion, the Chair proposed that the Committee vote on a final draft as soon in the intermeeting period as possible. In the Committee’s annual reconsideration of the State- ment on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strat- egy, all participants supported the statement as written, and the Committee voted unanimously to reaffirm with- out revision. In discussing the statement, the Chair noted that, con- sistent with previous communications, a formal frame- work review would commence in 2024 and conclude in 2025. That timing would allow perspectives on recent events to inform considerations of potential revisions to the framework. STATEMENT ON LONGER-RUN GOALS AND MONETARY POLICY STRATEGY (As reaffirmed effective January 25, 2022) The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is firmly committed to fulfilling its statutory mandate from the Congress of promoting maximum employment, sta- ble prices, and moderate long-term interest rates. The Committee seeks to explain its monetary policy deci- sions to the public as clearly as possible. Such clarity facilitates well-informed decisionmaking by households and businesses, reduces economic and financial uncer- tainty, increases the effectiveness of monetary policy, and enhances transparency and accountability, which are essential in a democratic society. Employment, inflation, and long-term interest rates fluctuate over time in response to economic and finan- cial disturbances. Monetary policy plays an important role in stabilizing the economy in response to these dis- turbances. The Committee’s primary means of adjusting the stance of monetary policy is through changes in the target range for the federal funds rate. The Committee judges that the level of the federal funds rate consistent with maximum employment and price stability over the longer run has declined relative to its historical average. Therefore, the federal funds rate is likely to be con- strained by its effective lower bound more frequently than in the past. Owing in part to the proximity of in- terest rates to the effective lower bound, the Committee judges that downward risks to employment and inflation have increased. The Committee is prepared to use its full range of tools to achieve its maximum employment and price stability goals. The maximum level of employment is a broad-based and inclusive goal that is not directly measurable and changes over time owing largely to nonmonetary factors that affect the structure and dynamics of the labor mar- ket. Consequently, it would not be appropriate to spec- ify a fixed goal for employment; rather, the Committee’s policy decisions must be informed by assessments of the shortfalls of employment from its maximum level, rec- ognizing that such assessments are necessarily uncertain and subject to revision. The Committee considers a wide range of indicators in making these assessments. The inflation rate over the longer run is primarily de- termined by monetary policy, and hence the Committee has the ability to specify a longer-run goal for inflation. The Committee reaffirms its judgment that inflation at the rate of 2 percent, as measured by the annual change in the price index for personal consumption expendi- tures, is most consistent over the longer run with the Federal Reserve’s statutory mandate. The Committee judges that longer-term inflation expectations that are well anchored at 2 percent foster price stability and mod- erate long-term interest rates and enhance the Commit- tee’s ability to promote maximum employment in the face of significant economic disturbances. In order to anchor longer-term inflation expectations at this level, the Committee seeks to achieve inflation that averages 2 percent over time, and therefore judges that, following periods when inflation has been running persistently be- low 2 percent, appropriate monetary policy will likely aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time. Monetary policy actions tend to influence economic activity, employment, and prices with a lag. In setting monetary policy, the Committee seeks over time to mit- igate shortfalls of employment from the Committee’s as- sessment of its maximum level and deviations of infla- tion from its longer-run goal. Moreover, sustainably achieving maximum employment and price stability de- pends on a stable financial system. Therefore, the Com- mittee’s policy decisions reflect its longer-run goals, its medium-term outlook, and its assessments of the bal- ance of risks, including risks to the financial system that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals. The Committee’s employment and inflation objectives are generally complementary. However, under circum- stances in which the Committee judges that the objec- tives are not complementary, it takes into account the employment shortfalls and inflation deviations and the potentially different time horizons over which employ- ment and inflation are projected to return to levels judged consistent with its mandate. The Committee intends to review these principles and to make adjustments as appropriate at its annual organi- zational meeting each January, and to undertake roughly _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Minutes of the Meeting of January 25–26, 2022 Page 9 every five years a thorough public review of its monetary policy strategy, tools, and communication practices. Financial Developments and Open Market Operations The manager turned first to a review of domestic finan- cial market developments over the intermeeting period. Treasury yields rose across the curve, led by higher real yields. Expectations for tighter monetary policy ahead, as well as an easing of COVID-related concerns, were cited as contributing to the increase in yields. The S&P 500 index declined around 5 percent, with sharp moves toward the end of the period, reportedly prompted by concerns about the implications of a tighter path of monetary policy and rising geopolitical risks. Regarding the monetary policy outlook, with data show- ing continuing tightening of labor market conditions and elevated inflationary pressures, policymaker communi- cations were perceived as pointing to an earlier and faster removal of accommodation than market partici- pants had previously expected. Against this backdrop, respondents to the Open Market Desk’s surveys of pri- mary dealers and market participants almost uniformly projected that the Federal Reserve’s net asset purchases would end by mid-March. The median survey projec- tion for the commencement of balance sheet runoff shifted into the third quarter of this year, roughly a year and a half sooner than in the December surveys. Most survey respondents also expected the portfolio to de- cline at a significantly faster pace than they did in De- cember. Expectations for the path of the federal funds rate shifted toward earlier rate increases, and interest rate fu- tures priced in an increase in the target range for the fed- eral funds rate at the March FOMC meeting. On aver- age, respondents to the Desk surveys assigned a roughly 70 percent probability to an increase in the target range in March. The expected path of the federal funds rate in the Desk surveys and derived from interest rate futures also steepened over the period. The median survey pro- jection for the most likely level of the target range at the end of 2024 was about 2 percent, similar to December. Nonetheless, survey respondents attached significant probability to outcomes in which the target range moved up more than indicated by the projected modal path. Changing views about the likely path of the Federal Re- serve’s balance sheet following the release of the Decem- ber FOMC minutes seemed to affect longer-term yields. Far forward real yields moved higher over the period, with much of the increase following the release of the minutes for the December FOMC meeting. In addition, agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) spreads wid- ened notably after having been stable at low levels for the past year, reportedly driven by expectations for an earlier and faster runoff of agency MBS than had been expected. The manager turned next to a discussion of international financial market developments. Sovereign yields in- creased across advanced foreign economies (AFEs), re- portedly driven by receding concerns about the Omi- cron variant, elevated inflation readings, and, relatedly, expectations that central banks would remove policy ac- commodation sooner than had been expected. Several central banks concluded their net asset purchases late last year, and more were expected to do so this year. On the outlook for policy rates, several central banks had either already increased their policy rates or were ex- pected to do so later this year. The manager provided an update on issues related to monetary policy implementation. Reductions in the pace of the Committee’s net asset purchases had pro- ceeded smoothly to date and functioning in Treasury and agency MBS markets remained stable. Regarding the potential for the Committee to reduce System Open Market Account (SOMA) holdings in the future, market participants generally anticipated that SOMA redemp- tions could proceed smoothly at a somewhat faster pace than during the previous period of balance sheet reduc- tion from 2017 to 2019. However, some also noted that SOMA redemptions would require significant adjust- ments to private-sector balance sheets, as investors ab- sorb the net increase in Treasury and agency MBS issu- ance to the private sector and money markets transition to lower levels of liquidity, and that these adjustments could take some time. The manager discussed expectations for the evolution of the Federal Reserve’s administered rates in connection with a potential future change in the target range for the federal funds rate. The Desk survey responses suggested expectations for administered rates to be raised by the same increment as the target range for the federal funds rate. The manager noted that the current setting of ad- ministered rates relative to the target range had been working well and anticipated that it could continue to support effective policy implementation following any increase in the target range in coming months, although adjustments could be warranted over time. By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk’s domestic transactions over the intermeeting period. No Page 10 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ intervention operations occurred in foreign currencies for the System’s account during the intermeeting period. Principles for Reducing the Size of the Balance Sheet Participants continued their discussion of topics associ- ated with potential adjustments in the Committee’s pol- icy tools that may be appropriate to support the achieve- ment of sustained strong labor market conditions and a return of inflation to levels consistent with the Commit- tee’s longer-run 2 percent objective under a wide range of circumstances. At this meeting, participants dis- cussed high-level principles that could be released to the public to describe the Committee’s approach for reduc- ing the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet. They agreed that the principles would address, at a high level, the sequence of adjustments in the interest rate and bal- ance sheet tools to reduce policy accommodation, the Committee’s approach to balance sheet runoff, and its intentions for the longer-run size and composition of the balance sheet. The participants’ discussion was pre- ceded by a staff presentation that reviewed key consid- erations raised by participants at the December FOMC meeting and examined how the proposed set of princi- ples, which reflected those considerations, compared with the Policy Normalization Principles and Plans is- sued in 2014. In their discussion, participants reaffirmed that changes in the target range for the federal funds rate are the Com- mittee’s primary means for adjusting the stance of mon- etary policy, as noted in the Committee’s Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy. Par- ticipants judged that the timing and pace of balance sheet reduction would be determined so as to promote the Committee’s maximum-employment and price-sta- bility goals and that it would be appropriate to begin the process of reducing the size of the balance sheet after the process of increasing the target range for the federal funds rate has begun. While participants agreed that de- tails on the timing and pace of balance sheet runoff would be determined at upcoming meetings, participants generally noted that current economic and financial con- ditions would likely warrant a faster pace of balance sheet runoff than during the period of balance sheet re- duction from 2017 to 2019. Participants observed that, in light of the current high level of the Federal Reserve’s securities holdings, a significant reduction in the size of the balance sheet would likely be appropriate. Partici- pants noted that the level of securities holdings con- sistent with implementing monetary policy efficiently and effectively in an ample reserves regime was uncer- tain and probably would remain so. Consequently, mar- ket conditions would have to be monitored closely to determine the appropriate longer-run level of reserves and the size of the balance sheet. Participants agreed that the Committee should reduce the Federal Reserve’s securities holdings over time in a predictable manner primarily by adjusting the amounts reinvested of principal payments received from securi- ties held in the SOMA. They also agreed that the SOMA should hold primarily Treasury securities in the longer run. Regarding these two principles, many participants commented that sales of agency MBS or reinvesting some portion of principal payments received from agency MBS into Treasury securities may be appropriate at some point in the future to enable suitable progress toward a longer-run SOMA portfolio composition con- sisting primarily of Treasury securities. Participants agreed that it was appropriate at this time for the Committee to publish its high-level principles for reducing the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet. They also agreed that it was important for the Commit- tee to retain the flexibility to adjust any of the details of its approach in light of changing economic and financial conditions. Participants noted that the principles would serve as an important guide in future deliberations on balance sheet reduction. While no decisions regarding specific details for reducing the size of the balance sheet were made at this meeting, participants agreed to con- tinue their discussions at upcoming meetings. Following the conclusion of the discussion, all partici- pants supported the proposed principles for reducing the size of the balance sheet. The Committee voted unanimously to adopt the Principles for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve’s Balance Sheet, as shown below. PRINCIPLES FOR REDUCING THE SIZE OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE’S BALANCE SHEET (As adopted effective January 25, 2022) The Federal Open Market Committee agreed that it is appropriate at this time to provide information regard- ing its planned approach for significantly reducing the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet. All partici- pants agreed on the following elements: • The Committee views changes in the target range for the federal funds rate as its pri- mary means of adjusting the stance of mon- etary policy. _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Minutes of the Meeting of January 25–26, 2022 Page 11 • The Committee will determine the timing and pace of reducing the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet so as to promote its maximum employment and price stability goals. The Committee expects that reduc- ing the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet will commence after the process of in- creasing the target range for the federal funds rate has begun. • The Committee intends to reduce the Fed- eral Reserve's securities holdings over time in a predictable manner primarily by adjust- ing the amounts reinvested of principal pay- ments received from securities held in the System Open Market Account (SOMA). • Over time, the Committee intends to main- tain securities holdings in amounts needed to implement monetary policy efficiently and effectively in its ample reserves regime. • In the longer run, the Committee intends to hold primarily Treasury securities in the SOMA, thereby minimizing the effect of Federal Reserve holdings on the allocation of credit across sectors of the economy. • The Committee is prepared to adjust any of the details of its approach to reducing the size of the balance sheet in light of eco- nomic and financial developments. Staff Review of the Economic Situation The information available at the time of the January 25– 26 meeting suggested that U.S. real gross domestic prod- uct (GDP) growth had picked up in the fourth quarter after slowing in the third quarter. Labor market condi- tions improved further in December, and indicators of labor compensation continued to show robust increases. Consumer price inflation through November—as meas- ured by the 12-month percentage change in the price in- dex for personal consumption expenditures (PCE)—re- mained elevated. Total nonfarm payroll employment posted a moderate gain in December. The unemployment rate declined from 4.2 percent in November to 3.9 percent in Decem- ber. The unemployment rate for African Americans moved higher, and the Hispanic unemployment rate de- clined; both rates remained well above the national aver- age. The labor force participation rate was unchanged in December, and the employment-to-population ratio moved up. The private-sector job openings rate, as measured by the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Sur- vey, moved down in November but remained well above pre-pandemic levels; the quits rate was also elevated. Weekly estimates of private-sector payrolls, constructed by the Board’s staff using data provided by the payroll processor ADP that were available through the first half of January, pointed to a slower pace of private employ- ment gains relative to December. Average hourly earn- ings rose at an annual rate of 6.2 percent over the last three months of the year; although wage increases were widespread across industries, they were particularly no- table in the leisure and hospitality sector as well as the transportation and warehousing sector. Inflation readings remained high, and various indicators suggested that inflationary pressures had broadened over the second half of 2021. Total PCE price inflation was 5.7 percent over the 12 months ending in Novem- ber, and core PCE price inflation, which excludes changes in consumer energy prices and many consumer food prices, was 4.7 percent over the same period. The trimmed mean measure of 12-month PCE inflation con- structed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas was 2.8 percent in November, 1 percentage point higher than its year-earlier rate of increase. In December, the 12-month change in the consumer price index (CPI) was 7.0 percent, while core CPI inflation was 5.5 percent over the same period. The staff’s common inflation ex- pectations index, which combines information from many indicators of inflation expectations and inflation compensation, had largely leveled off over the fall and was close to its 2014 average. Real PCE was unchanged in November, and available indicators—including the components of the nominal retail sales data used to estimate PCE—pointed to a de- cline in December, possibly reflecting the sharp rise in COVID-19 cases in the second half of that month as well as some holiday sales having been pulled forward to earlier months. Housing demand remained strong, and available indicators suggested that residential investment increased in the fourth quarter. However, shortages of construction materials, buildable lots, and other inputs continued to weigh on activity in this sector. Business fixed investment appeared to post only a small gain in the fourth quarter, as investment in transporta- tion equipment was held back by supply bottlenecks and limited supplies of construction materials restrained nonresidential structures investment. Manufacturing output moved down in December after advancing strongly in October and November. Motor Page 12 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ vehicle assemblies reversed some of their November in- crease; in addition, manufacturing production outside of motor vehicles ticked lower. Total real government purchases appeared to have fallen in the fourth quarter. Although available data suggested that real federal purchases rose, indicators of real state and local government purchases pointed to a decline in the fourth quarter despite state and local governments’ extremely strong budget positions and the widespread return to in-person schooling last fall. The U.S. international trade deficit widened at the end of last year. Imports of goods rose sharply in November and December, led by increases in consumer goods, while exports of goods were little changed over the two months, on net, after surging in October. Shipping con- gestion and other bottlenecks continued to restrain the level of trade in goods. Meanwhile, services exports jumped in November, reflecting a sizable increase in ex- ports of travel services after the reopening of U.S. bor- ders to vaccinated foreign travelers early in the month. Even so, services trade was very low relative to pre-pan- demic norms, largely because the level of international travel remained depressed. Incoming data suggested that foreign economic growth picked up in the fourth quarter of 2021 as economies in emerging Asia bounced back from lockdowns in the third quarter induced by the Delta variant of the COVID-19 virus. Purchasing managers indexes (PMIs) pointed to improved supplier delivery times, and foreign vehicle production rose notably, suggesting that supply bottlenecks continued to ease somewhat. However, the rapid spread of the Omicron variant led to renewed pub- lic health restrictions in several countries, particularly in China, and appeared to be weighing on activity at the start of the year. Inflation abroad continued to rise, mostly driven by further increases in retail energy prices, effects from supply bottlenecks, and, in some emerging market economies (EMEs), by rising food prices. That said, input and output price components of PMIs pro- vided some tentative signs that easing supply constraints have started to contribute to some letup in inflationary pressures in several foreign economies. Staff Review of the Financial Situation Over the intermeeting period, easing concerns around the economic effects of the Omicron variant and FOMC communications that were viewed as less accommoda- tive than expected contributed to increases in Treasury yields. Long-term sovereign yields in AFEs also rose no- tably. Broad domestic equity indexes decreased mark- edly, and spreads of corporate bonds widened modestly. Short-term funding markets were stable, while participa- tion in the overnight reverse repurchase agreement (ON RRP) facility increased further. Market-based fi- nancing conditions remained accommodative, and bank lending standards eased for most loan categories. The expected path for the federal funds rate over the next few years—implied by a straight read of overnight index swap quotes—rose notably since the December FOMC meeting, apparently reflecting less-accommoda- tive-than-expected FOMC communications and an eas- ing of concerns around the economic effects of the Omicron variant. Those factors also contributed to no- table rises in 2-, 5-, and 10-year nominal Treasury yields. Inflation compensation implied by Treasury Inflation- Protected Securities rose slightly, on net. Broad equity indexes decreased markedly, on net, partic- ularly in the latter part of the intermeeting period, as shifts in expectations about the pace of monetary policy tightening, global inflationary pressures, and escalating tensions between Russia and Ukraine weighed on equity prices. The one-month option-implied volatility on the S&P 500—the VIX—increased considerably, on net, to above the 90th percentile of its historical distribution. Spreads of investment- and speculative-grade corporate bonds widened modestly. Spreads of municipal bonds were roughly unchanged. Short-term funding markets were stable over the inter- meeting period. The effective federal funds rate and the Secured Overnight Financing Rate generally held steady at 8 basis points and 5 basis points, respectively. Partic- ipation in ON RRP operations averaged $1.6 trillion, about $150 billion higher than during the previous inter- meeting period, and reached an all-time high of $1.9 tril- lion at year-end. Government money market funds con- tinued to receive investment inflows and accounted for the majority of ON RRP take-up. Over the intermeeting period, movements in foreign as- set prices responded to waning concerns about the Omi- cron variant’s potential economic effects and firming views that monetary accommodation in several ad- vanced economies will be removed at a faster pace than previously expected. Some market participants also pointed to rising geopolitical tensions related to Russia as contributing to the moves. On net, AFE sovereign yields increased notably, most major foreign equity in- dexes declined moderately, and the broad dollar index decreased modestly. EME sovereign spreads widened, and capital flows into EME-dedicated bond funds re- mained slightly negative, while flows into EME equity funds turned positive. _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Minutes of the Meeting of January 25–26, 2022 Page 13 In domestic credit markets, financing conditions for nonfinancial firms remained broadly accommodative. Gross issuance of corporate bonds and leveraged loans remained solid but slowed somewhat in December, re- flecting seasonal factors. Equity funding raised through initial public offerings continued at a strong pace in No- vember and December, while equity issuance through special purpose acquisition companies remained muted relative to earlier in 2021. Commercial and industrial (C&I) loans expanded over the fourth quarter following more than a year of de- clines. In the January Senior Loan Officer Opinion Sur- vey on Bank Lending Practices (SLOOS), banks re- ported easier standards and stronger demand for C&I loans over the fourth quarter. The credit quality of large nonfinancial corporations re- mained strong over the intermeeting period. The vol- umes of nonfinancial corporate bond and leveraged loan upgrades exceeded those of downgrades in November and December. Trailing default rates on nonfinancial bonds edged down further to historical lows, while mar- ket indicators of future expected default rates remained benign and historically low. In the municipal bond market, financing conditions re- mained accommodative, as municipal bond yields stayed near historical lows. Issuance of municipal debt was strong in November and December. The credit quality of municipal debt remained stable, and the volume of defaults stayed low. Financing conditions for small businesses eased a bit over the intermeeting period. In the January SLOOS, small banks reported easing C&I loan standards to small firms over the fourth quarter. Loan originations to small businesses rose in November to near pre-pandemic lev- els. Banks in the January SLOOS reported stronger loan demand by small firms over the fourth quarter, though loan demand remained weak overall. Commercial real estate (CRE) loan balances on banks’ books expanded at a solid pace in the fourth quarter, and, in the January SLOOS, banks reported an easing of standards on such loans amid stronger demand for most CRE loan categories. Issuance of non-agency commer- cial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) surged in the fourth quarter, while issuance of agency CMBS slowed. Delinquency rates on mortgages in CMBS pools contin- ued to fall but remained elevated for hotel and retail mortgages. In the residential mortgage market, financing conditions remained accommodative, particularly for borrowers who met standard conforming loan criteria. In the Jan- uary SLOOS, banks reported easing lending standards for most mortgage categories in the fourth quarter. Mortgage rates increased over the intermeeting period in line with rates on agency MBS and 10-year Treasury se- curities but remained low by historical standards. The fraction of mortgage borrowers missing payments con- tinued to decline through November. Financing conditions for consumer credit remained ac- commodative for most borrowers, especially those with higher credit scores. Lending standards for nonprime consumers in the credit card market continued to ease from the tight levels seen earlier in the pandemic. Banks reported in the January SLOOS that demand for credit card loans strengthened over the fourth quarter, while lending standards eased for auto loans amid a weakening in demand. With sales running low because of con- strained supply, auto loan growth continued to slow in October and November from the more rapid pace rec- orded in the first half of the year. The staff provided an update on its assessments of the stability of the financial system and, on balance, charac- terized the financial vulnerabilities of the U.S. financial system as notable. The staff judged that asset valuation pressures remained elevated. In particular, the forward price-to-earnings ratio for the S&P 500 index stood at the upper end of its historical distribution; high-yield corporate bond spreads and the excess loan premium for leveraged loans remained at low levels; and house prices grew strongly, with price-to-rent ratios that were at ele- vated levels. The staff noted that the market capitaliza- tion of crypto-assets had grown significantly over the past decade and had experienced considerable volatility, including sizable declines since late last year. The staff changed its assessment of vulnerabilities associated with nonfinancial leverage from notable to moderate, noting that measures of business leverage had declined to pre- pandemic levels. Household delinquency rates remained relatively low, while household borrowing rose but was concentrated among prime borrowers. Vulnerabilities arising from financial leverage remained moderate. Risk-based capital ratios for banks remained above their pre-pandemic levels even after the resumption of share- holder payouts. In contrast, some available measures of hedge fund leverage continued to increase, and im- portant data gaps continued to limit a full assessment of vulnerabilities posed by many nonbank financial institu- tions. Vulnerabilities associated with funding risks were characterized as moderate. Prime and tax-exempt money funds continued to have structural vulnerabilities that may lead investors to withdraw funds quickly in a Page 14 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ stress situation and were a potential source of spillovers to other short-term funding markets. In response, the Securities and Exchange Commission proposed reforms in December 2021 to make these funds more resilient. Another vulnerability in funding markets was the signif- icant growth in stablecoin arrangements over the past few years, which may increase challenges related to run risk and pose additional risks from their potential role as a means of payment. Staff Economic Outlook The near-term projection for U.S. economic activity pre- pared by the staff for the January FOMC meeting was weaker than in December, reflecting the sharp rise in COVID-19 infections caused by the rapid spread of the Omicron variant and an assessment that supply con- straints would resolve more slowly than previously ex- pected. Although real GDP still appeared to have posted a sizable gain in the fourth quarter of 2021, out- put growth was expected to slow noticeably in the first quarter of 2022 before picking up again later in the year as COVID-19 cases declined and supply issues contin- ued to be resolved. With most of the boost to growth from the reopening of the economy and easing of supply constraints expected to occur in 2022, real GDP growth was projected to step down in 2023 and to be roughly in line with potential growth in 2023 and 2024. However, the level of real GDP was expected to remain well above potential throughout the projection period, and labor market conditions were expected to remain very tight. The staff’s near-term projection for PCE price inflation was revised up relative to December in response to the anticipated slower resolution of supply issues. In partic- ular, the staff continued to expect that monthly inflation rates would move lower as supply constraints eased, but the projected step-down was less pronounced than in the December forecast. Even so, an improvement in supply conditions and a decline in consumer energy prices were expected to slow PCE price inflation to 2.6 percent in 2022. With supply conditions expected to normalize further but with the labor market expected to remain very tight, PCE price inflation was projected to decline to 2 percent in 2023 before edging up to 2.1 per- cent in 2024. The staff continued to judge that the risks to the baseline projection for economic activity were skewed to the downside and that the risks to the inflation projection were skewed to the upside. In particular, the possibility that the economic effects of the virus would turn out to be larger than assumed in the baseline projection was viewed as an important source of downside risk to activ- ity, while the possibility of more severe and more persis- tent supply issues was viewed as an additional downside risk to activity and as an upside risk to inflation. Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook In their discussion of current economic conditions, par- ticipants noted that indicators of economic activity and employment had continued to strengthen. The sectors most adversely affected by the pandemic had improved in recent months but continued to be affected by the re- cent sharp rise in COVID-19 cases. Job gains had been solid in recent months, and the unemployment rate had declined substantially. Supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic and the reopening of the econ- omy had continued to contribute to elevated levels of inflation. Overall financial conditions had remained ac- commodative, in part reflecting policy measures to sup- port the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. house- holds and businesses. Participants judged that the path of the economy continued to depend on the course of the virus. Progress on vaccinations and an easing of sup- ply constraints were expected to support continued gains in economic activity and employment as well as a reduction in inflation. Risks to the economic outlook remained, including from new variants of the virus. With regard to the economic outlook, participants agreed that the Omicron wave of the pandemic would weigh on economic activity in the first quarter of 2022. Indeed, sectors of the economy that are particularly sen- sitive to pandemic-related disruptions, including travel, leisure, and restaurants, were experiencing sharp reduc- tions in activity as a result of the Omicron wave. Partic- ipants commented that, for many afflicted individuals and families, the virus continued to cause great hardship. Participants concurred that if the Omicron wave dissi- pated quickly, then economic activity would likely strengthen rapidly and economic growth for 2022 as a whole would be robust. Participants cited strong house- hold balance sheets, rising wages, and effective adapta- tion to the pandemic by the business sector as factors supporting the outlook for strong growth this year. However, a number of participants noted that there was a risk that additional variants could weigh on economic activity this year. Participants noted that supply chain bottlenecks and la- bor shortages had continued to limit businesses’ ability to meet strong demand, with these challenges exacer- bated by the emergence and spread of the Omicron var- iant. In particular, the Omicron wave had led to much _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Minutes of the Meeting of January 25–26, 2022 Page 15 more widespread worker absences due to illness, virus exposure, or caregiving needs, which had curtailed activ- ity in many sectors including airlines, trucking, and ware- housing. Some participants reported that their business contacts were hopeful that the effects of the Omicron wave would be relatively short lived. Nevertheless, sev- eral participants reported that their contacts expected the ongoing labor shortages and other supply constraints to persist well after the acute effects of the Omicron wave had waned. Participants’ contacts also reported continued widespread input cost pressures, which, amid generally robust demand, they reported having largely been able to pass on to their customers. A few partici- pants commented that agricultural businesses were ex- periencing higher input costs, and those higher costs were putting strain on the finances of those firms even as they experienced generally strong demand for their products. In their discussion of the household sector, many partic- ipants noted that the onset of the Omicron wave had damped consumer demand, particularly for services, with much of the recent weakness concentrated in high- contact sectors such as travel, dining, and leisure and hospitality. Almost all of those participants anticipated that household demand would recover briskly if the Omicron wave subsided quickly, with spending sup- ported by strong household balance sheets that were bolstered by high rates of saving earlier in the pandemic and ongoing robust gains in labor income. Participants noted that the labor market had made re- markable progress in recovering from the recession as- sociated with the pandemic and, by most measures, was now very strong. Increases in employment had been solid in recent months; the unemployment rate had de- clined sharply, reaching 3.9 percent in December; job openings and quits were near record high levels; and nominal wages were rising at the fastest pace in decades. Several participants commented that the gains, on bal- ance, over recent months had been broad based, with notable improvements for lower-wage workers as well as African Americans and Hispanics. Against this back- drop of a generally strong and improving labor market, many participants observed that the effects of the Omi- cron variant likely would only temporarily suppress the rate of labor market gains. The labor force participation rate had edged up further over the past few months, and some participants indicated that they expected it to con- tinue to increase as the pandemic eased. A couple of participants noted that the participation rate remained lower than trend levels that account for changing de- mographics. Participants noted that their District contacts were re- porting that labor demand remained historically strong and that labor supply remained constrained, resulting in a broad shortage of workers across many parts of the economy. As a result, there was widespread evidence that the labor market was very tight, including near-rec- ord rates of quits and job vacancies as well as nominal wage growth that was the highest recorded in decades. Several participants reported that District business con- tacts were either planning to implement or had imple- mented larger wage increases than those of recent years to retain current employees or attract new workers. A few participants also reported contacts having been forced to reduce operating hours or close businesses temporarily because of labor shortages. Acknowledging that the maximum level of employment consistent with price stability evolves over time, partici- pants expressed a range of views regarding their assess- ments of current labor market conditions relative to the Committee’s goal of maximum employment. Many par- ticipants commented that they viewed labor market con- ditions as already at or very close to those consistent with maximum employment, citing indications of strong labor markets including the low levels of unemployment rates, elevated wage pressures, near-record levels of job openings and quits, and a broad shortage of workers across many parts of the economy. A couple of partici- pants commented that, in their view, the economy likely had not yet reached maximum employment, noting that, even for prime-age workers, labor force participation rates were still lower than those that prevailed before the pandemic or that a reallocation of labor across sectors could lead to higher levels of employment over time. Participants remarked that recent inflation readings had continued to significantly exceed the Committee’s longer-run goal and elevated inflation was persisting longer than they had anticipated, reflecting supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic and the re- opening of the economy. However, some participants commented that elevated inflation had broadened be- yond sectors most directly affected by those factors, bol- stered in part by strong consumer demand. In addition, various participants cited other developments that had the potential to place additional upward pressure on in- flation, including real wage growth in excess of produc- tivity growth and increases in prices for housing services. Participants acknowledged that elevated inflation was a burden on U.S. households, particularly those who were least able to pay higher prices for essential goods and services. Some participants reported that their business Page 16 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ contacts remained concerned about persistently high in- flation and that they were adjusting their business prac- tices to cope with higher input costs—for instance, by raising output prices or utilizing contracts that were con- tingent on their costs. Participants generally expected inflation to moderate over the course of the year as sup- ply and demand imbalances ease and monetary policy accommodation is removed. Some participants re- marked that longer-term measures of inflation expecta- tions appeared to remain well anchored, which would support a return of inflation over time to levels con- sistent with the Committee’s goals. In their discussion of risks to the outlook, participants agreed that uncertainty regarding the path of inflation was elevated and that risks to inflation were weighted to the upside. Participants cited several such risks, includ- ing the zero-tolerance COVID-19 policy in China that had the potential to further disrupt supply chains, the possibility of geopolitical turmoil that could cause in- creases in global energy prices or exacerbate global sup- ply shortages, a worsening of the pandemic, persistent real wage growth in excess of productivity growth that could trigger inflationary wage–price dynamics, or the possibility that longer-term inflation expectations could become unanchored. A few participants pointed to the possibility that structural factors that had contributed to low inflation in the previous decade, such as technolog- ical changes, demographics, and a low real interest rate environment, may reemerge when the effects of the pan- demic abate. Uncertainty about real activity was also seen as elevated. Various participants noted downside risks to the outlook, including a possible worsening of the pandemic, the potential for escalating geopolitical tensions, or a substantial tightening in financial condi- tions. Participants who commented on issues related to finan- cial stability cited a number of factors that could repre- sent potential vulnerabilities to the financial system. A few participants noted that asset valuations were ele- vated across a range of markets and raised the concern that a major realignment of asset prices could contribute to a future downturn. A couple of these participants judged that prolonged accommodative financial condi- tions could be contributing to financial imbalances. A couple of other participants cited reasons why elevated asset valuations might prove to be less of a threat to fi- nancial stability than in past reversals of asset prices. In particular, they noted the relatively healthy balance sheet positions of households and nonfinancial firms, the well- capitalized and liquid banking sector, and the fact that the rise in housing prices was not being fueled by a large increase in mortgage debt as suggesting that the financial system might prove resilient to shocks. Some partici- pants saw emerging risks to financial stability associated with the rapid growth in crypto-assets and decentralized finance platforms. A few participants pointed to risks associated with highly leveraged, nonbank financial in- stitutions or the potential vulnerability of prime money market funds to a sudden withdrawal of liquidity. In their consideration of the stance of monetary policy, participants agreed that it would be appropriate for the Committee to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent in support of the Committee’s ob- jectives of maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. They also antici- pated that it would soon be appropriate to raise the tar- get range. In discussing why beginning to remove policy accommodation could soon be warranted, participants noted that inflation continued to run well above 2 per- cent and generally judged the risks to the outlook for in- flation as tilted to the upside. Participants also assessed that the labor market was strong, having made substan- tial, broad-based progress over the past year. In light of elevated inflation pressures and the strong la- bor market, participants continued to judge that the Committee’s net asset purchases should be concluded soon. Most participants preferred to continue to reduce the Committee’s net asset purchases according to the schedule announced in December, bringing them to an end in early March. A couple of participants stated that they favored ending the Committee’s net asset purchases sooner to send an even stronger signal that the Commit- tee was committed to bringing down inflation. Participants discussed the implications of the economic outlook for the likely timing and pace for removing pol- icy accommodation. Compared with conditions in 2015 when the Committee last began a process of removing monetary policy accommodation, participants viewed that there was a much stronger outlook for growth in economic activity, substantially higher inflation, and a notably tighter labor market. Consequently, most par- ticipants suggested that a faster pace of increases in the target range for the federal funds rate than in the post- 2015 period would likely be warranted, should the econ- omy evolve generally in line with the Committee’s ex- pectation. Even so, participants emphasized that the ap- propriate path of policy would depend on economic and financial developments and their implications for the outlook and the risks around the outlook, and they will be updating their assessments of the appropriate setting for the policy stance at each meeting. Participants noted _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Minutes of the Meeting of January 25–26, 2022 Page 17 that the removal of policy accommodation in current cir- cumstances depended on the timing and pace of both increases in the target range of the federal funds rate and the reduction in the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet. In this context, a number of participants com- mented that conditions would likely warrant beginning to reduce the size of the balance sheet sometime later this year. In their discussion of the outlook for monetary policy, many participants noted the influence on financial con- ditions of the Committee’s recent communications and viewed these communications as helpful in shifting pri- vate-sector expectations regarding the policy outlook into better alignment with the Committee’s assessment of appropriate policy. Participants continued to stress that maintaining flexibility to implement appropriate policy adjustments on the basis of risk-management considerations should be a guiding principle in conduct- ing policy in the current highly uncertain environment. Most participants noted that, if inflation does not move down as they expect, it would be appropriate for the Committee to remove policy accommodation at a faster pace than they currently anticipate. Some participants commented on the risk that financial conditions might tighten unduly in response to a rapid removal of policy accommodation. A few participants remarked that this risk could be mitigated through clear and effective com- munication of the Committee’s assessments of the eco- nomic outlook, the risks around the outlook, and the ap- propriate path for monetary policy. Committee Policy Action In their discussion of monetary policy for this meeting, members agreed that indicators of economic activity and employment had continued to strengthen. They noted that the sectors most adversely affected by the pandemic had improved in recent months but were being affected by the recent sharp rise in COVID-19 cases. Job gains had been solid in recent months, and the unemployment rate had declined substantially. Members remarked that supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic and the reopening of the economy had continued to contribute to elevated levels of inflation. Overall finan- cial conditions remained accommodative, in part reflect- ing policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses. Mem- bers also acknowledged that the path of the economy continued to depend on the course of the virus. Pro- gress on vaccinations and an easing of supply constraints were expected to support continued gains in economic activity and employment as well as a reduction in infla- tion, but risks to the economic outlook remained, in- cluding from new variants of the virus. In order to support the Committee’s maximum-employ- ment and price-stability objectives, members agreed to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent. With inflation well above 2 percent and a strong labor market, members expected that it would soon be appropriate to raise the target range for the fed- eral funds rate. Members agreed to continue to reduce the monthly pace of the Committee’s net asset pur- chases, bringing them to an end in early March. Specif- ically, beginning in February, the Committee would in- crease its holdings of Treasury securities by at least $20 billion per month and of agency MBS by at least $10 billion per month. Members noted that the Federal Reserve’s ongoing asset purchases and holdings of secu- rities would continue to foster smooth market function- ing and accommodative financial conditions, thereby supporting the flow of credit to households and busi- nesses. Members agreed that, in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, they would continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and that they would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate in the event that risks emerged that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals. They also concurred that, in as- sessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, they would take into account a wide range of information, in- cluding readings on public health, labor market condi- tions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments. Members agreed to remove the opening sentence from previous postmeeting statements regarding using the Federal Reserve’s full range of tools to support the U.S. economy. This language was adopted during the height of the financial market turmoil in March 2020, when the Committee began its asset purchase program, and mem- bers acknowledged that it was no longer warranted in light of the strong economy as well as the Committee’s announcement that net asset purchases would end in early March. Members agreed that the postmeeting statement should be updated to reflect the Committee’s expectation that it would soon be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate in light of ele- vated inflation pressures and the strong labor market. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until instructed otherwise, to execute Page 18 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the fol- lowing domestic policy directive, for release at 2:00 p.m.: “Effective January 27, 2022, the Federal Open Market Committee directs the Desk to: • Undertake open market operations as nec- essary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of 0 to ¼ percent. • Complete the increase in System Open Market Account (SOMA) holdings of Treasury securities by $40 billion and of agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) by $20 billion, as indicated in the monthly purchase plans released in mid-January. • Increase the SOMA holdings of Treasury securities by $20 billion and of agency MBS by $10 billion, during the monthly purchase period beginning in mid-February. • Increase holdings of Treasury securities and agency MBS by additional amounts as needed to sustain smooth functioning of markets for these securities. • Conduct overnight repurchase agreement operations with a minimum bid rate of 0.25 percent and with an aggregate opera- tion limit of $500 billion; the aggregate op- eration limit can be temporarily increased at the discretion of the Chair. • Conduct overnight reverse repurchase agreement operations at an offering rate of 0.05 percent and with a per-counterparty limit of $160 billion per day; the per-coun- terparty limit can be temporarily increased at the discretion of the Chair. • Roll over at auction all principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of Treasury securities and reinvest all principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s hold- ings of agency debt and agency MBS in agency MBS. • Allow modest deviations from stated amounts for purchases and reinvestments, if needed for operational reasons. • Engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settle- ment of the Federal Reserve’s agency MBS transactions.” The vote also encompassed approval of the state- ment below for release at 2:00 p.m.: “Indicators of economic activity and employ- ment have continued to strengthen. The sec- tors most adversely affected by the pandemic have improved in recent months but are being affected by the recent sharp rise in COVID-19 cases. Job gains have been solid in recent months, and the unemployment rate has de- clined substantially. Supply and demand imbal- ances related to the pandemic and the reopening of the economy have continued to contribute to elevated levels of inflation. Overall financial conditions remain accommodative, in part re- flecting policy measures to support the econ- omy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses. The path of the economy continues to depend on the course of the virus. Progress on vaccina- tions and an easing of supply constraints are ex- pected to support continued gains in economic activity and employment as well as a reduction in inflation. Risks to the economic outlook re- main, including from new variants of the virus. The Committee seeks to achieve maximum em- ployment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. In support of these goals, the Committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent. With inflation well above 2 percent and a strong labor market, the Committee expects it will soon be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate. The Committee decided to continue to reduce the monthly pace of its net asset purchases, bringing them to an end in early March. Beginning in February, the Com- mittee will increase its holdings of Treasury se- curities by at least $20 billion per month and of agency mortgage‑backed securities by at least $10 billion per month. The Federal Reserve’s ongoing purchases and holdings of securities will continue to foster smooth market function- ing and accommodative financial conditions, thereby supporting the flow of credit to house- holds and businesses. In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Minutes of the Meeting of January 25–26, 2022 Page 19 policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals. The Committee’s assessments will take into account a wide range of information, in- cluding readings on public health, labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation ex- pectations, and financial and international de- velopments.” Voting for this action: Jerome H. Powell, Chair; John C. Williams, Vice Chair; Michelle W. Bowman; Lael Brainard; James Bullard; Esther L. George; Patrick Harker; Loretta J. Mester; and Christopher J. Waller. Voting against this action: None. Patrick Harker voted as an alternate member at this meeting. Consistent with the Committee’s decision to leave the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged, the Board voted unanimously to maintain the interest rate paid on reserve balances at 0.15 percent, effective Janu- ary 27, 2022. The Board also voted unanimously to ap- prove the establishment of the primary credit rate at the existing level of 0.25 percent. It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Tuesday–Wednesday, March 15–16, 2022. The meeting adjourned at 10:10 a.m. on Janu- ary 26, 2022. Notation Vote By notation vote completed on January 4, 2022, the Committee unanimously approved the minutes of the Committee meeting held on December 14–15, 2021. _______________________ James A.

Following the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the subsequent imposition of an array of sanctions, the ruble depreciated roughly 40 percent against the dollar. Prices of dollar-denominated Russian bonds plunged 80 to 90 percent, and local trading of Russian equities was suspended after a precipitous de- cline in Russian stock price indexes. Global financial conditions tightened, reflecting declines in equity prices, increases in sovereign yields and credit spreads, and— for the United States—an appreciation of the dollar. Prices of commodities that Russia exports, particularly oil and natural gas, soared over the period. While oil prices partially retraced late in the period, options prices suggested considerable probability that oil prices could remain elevated or rise further in the months ahead. Alongside the rise in commodities prices, measures of near-term inflation compensation increased sharply across advanced economies. In Eastern European countries, currencies depreciated notably and equity prices declined, but most emerging market currencies outside of Eastern Europe depreciated only modestly or rose. Sovereign spreads for emerging market economies (EMEs) widened, but the moves outside of Eastern Eu- rope were relatively modest. The developments in Ukraine sparked some liquidity strains across markets. Overnight interest rates were steady throughout the period, but there were some signs of pressures in term funding markets. High levels of re- serves in the banking system and the backstop facilities Page 2 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ in place—the new repurchase agreement facility for for- eign and international monetary authorities (FIMA Repo Facility) and the standing repo facility (SRF), as well as the standing central bank liquidity swap lines and the dis- count window—likely supported market confidence re- garding the availability of liquidity and helped contain funding pressures. Amid a rise in market volatility, trad- ing liquidity declined across a number of sectors. In the Treasury market, market depth fell and the price impact of trades increased modestly in some sectors. Overall, however, volumes were typical, and markets continued to function in an orderly fashion. Notwithstanding uncertainties associated with geopolit- ical developments, many central banks continued to sig- nal intentions to move ahead with reducing policy ac- commodation to address elevated inflation. Market- implied policy rates one year forward rose notably across many advanced foreign economies (AFEs), extending increases seen over recent months. In the United States, incoming economic data and Fed- eral Reserve communications led investors to expect a more rapid removal of policy accommodation than they had previously expected. Market participants almost universally expected a 25 basis point increase in the tar- get range for the federal funds rate at the current meet- ing. Moreover, futures prices implied that the federal funds rate would increase around 170 basis points through year-end, about 70 basis points more than had been priced in at the time of the January meeting. Simi- larly, the median projection of the target range for the federal funds rate in the Open Market Desk’s most re- cent surveys of primary dealers and market participants showed an increase of 150 basis points this year. The median projected path for the target range beyond 2022 rose another 100 basis points by the first half of 2024 to a level modestly above the median projected longer-run level before returning closer to the longer-run level in 2025. Consistent with shifting expectations for the path of policy, shorter-dated Treasury yields rose notably over the intermeeting period and the spread between the 10-year Treasury yield and 2-year Treasury yield nar- rowed. Market participants expected an earlier and somewhat faster reduction in System Open Market Account (SOMA) holdings of securities than they did in January. In the Desk surveys, almost 90 percent of respondents projected balance sheet runoff to begin by July. Overall, survey respondents expected a significant reduction in the balance sheet over coming years, although there was a high degree of uncertainty around the magnitude of the total decline. The manager turned next to a discussion of money mar- kets and policy implementation. Market participants ex- pected the interest on reserve balances rate and over- night reverse repurchase agreement (ON RRP) offering rate to be increased by 25 basis points at the current meeting, in line with their expected increase in the target range, and anticipated that the changes would fully pass through to market overnight interest rates. There was uncertainty around how ON RRP usage might evolve in the near term as money market rates increased. If banks lifted their deposit rates by less than the increase in re- turns available on alternative investments, depositors could shift funds into these alternatives, leading to downward pressure on rates and increased ON RRP take-up. If instead deposit rates moved up in line with net yields on alternative investments, ON RRP takeup could remain relatively steady. Over the longer term, however, ON RRP balances were expected to decline as the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet runoff proceeded and gradually lifted money market rates relative to the ON RRP rate. Turning to Desk operations, the manager noted that the Desk would be maintaining the size of the SOMA port- folio through reinvestments until the Committee di- rected otherwise. For Treasury securities, the Desk would follow the usual practice of rolling over all princi- pal payments at auctions. In the absence of regular sec- ondary-market purchases of Treasury securities, the Desk planned to maintain operational readiness by con- ducting small-value purchases and sales of Treasury se- curities. For agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS), the Desk planned to continue to reinvest principal pay- ments on a monthly basis through secondary-market purchases. The manager discussed a plan to simplify ad- ministrative aspects of the SOMA holdings of agency MBS in coming months through a process of CUSIP (Committee on Uniform Securities Identification Proce- dures) aggregation. The Desk undertook similar pro- grams of CUSIP aggregation following the conclusion of previous large-scale asset purchase programs; these past CUSIP aggregation programs were successful at reduc- ing the cost and complexity of maintaining agency MBS holdings. Finally, the manager provided an update on the SRF. The Desk had onboarded four depository institutions as counterparties and noted that a number of additional banks were currently under review. The Desk planned to adjust the counterparty eligibility requirements in Minutes of the Meeting of March 15–16, 2022 Page 3 _____________________________________________________________________________________________ early April to make the SRF accessible to a broader range of banks, in line with the Committee’s intention to ex- pand eligibility over time and with efforts to ensure that Desk counterparty policies promote a fair and competi- tive marketplace. By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk’s domestic transactions over the intermeeting period. No intervention operations occurred in foreign currencies for the System’s account during the intermeeting period. Plans for Reducing the Size of the Balance Sheet Participants continued their discussion of topics related to plans for reducing the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet in a manner consistent with the approach described in the Principles for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve’s Balance Sheet that the Committee re- leased following its January meeting. The participants’ discussion was preceded by a staff presentation that reviewed the Committee’s 2017–19 ex- perience with balance sheet reduction and presented a range of possible options for reducing the Federal Re- serve’s securities holdings over time in a predictable manner. All of the options featured a more rapid pace of balance sheet runoff than in the 2017–19 episode. The options differed primarily with respect to the size of the monthly caps for securities redemptions in the SOMA portfolio. The presentation addressed the po- tential implications of each option for the path of the balance sheet during and after runoff. The staff presen- tation also featured alternative approaches the Commit- tee could consider with respect to SOMA holdings of Treasury bills as well as alternative ways the Committee could eventually slow and then stop balance sheet runoff as the size of the SOMA portfolio approached levels consistent with the Committee’s ample-reserves frame- work for policy implementation. In their discussion, all participants agreed that elevated inflation and tight labor market conditions warranted commencement of balance sheet runoff at a coming meeting, with a faster pace of decline in securities hold- ings than over the 2017–19 period. Participants reaf- firmed that the Federal Reserve’s securities holdings should be reduced over time in a predictable manner pri- marily by adjusting the amounts reinvested of principal payments received from securities held in the SOMA. Principal payments received from securities held in the SOMA would be reinvested to the extent they exceeded monthly caps. Several participants remarked that they would be comfortable with relatively high monthly caps or no caps. Some other participants noted that monthly caps for Treasury securities should take into considera- tion potential risks to market functioning. Participants generally agreed that monthly caps of about $60 billion for Treasury securities and about $35 billion for agency MBS would likely be appropriate. Participants also gen- erally agreed that the caps could be phased in over a pe- riod of three months or modestly longer if market con- ditions warrant. Participants discussed the approach toward implement- ing caps for Treasury securities and the role that the Fed- eral Reserve’s holdings of Treasury bills might play in the Committee’s plan to reduce the size of the balance sheet. Most participants judged that it would be appropriate to redeem coupon securities up to the cap amount each month and to redeem Treasury bills in months when Treasury coupon principal payments were below the cap. Under this approach, redemption of Treasury bills would typically bring the total amount of Treasury re- demptions up to the monthly cap. Several participants remarked that reducing the Federal Reserve’s Treasury bill holdings over time would be appropriate because Treasury bills are highly valued as safe and liquid assets by the private sector, and the Treasury could increase bill issuance to the public as SOMA bill holdings decline. In addition, participants generally noted that maintaining large holdings of Treasury bills is not necessary under the Federal Reserve’s ample-reserves operating frame- work; in the previous scarce-reserves regime, Treasury bill holdings were useful as a tool that could be used to drain reserves from the banking system when necessary to control short-term interest rates. A couple of partic- ipants commented that holding some Treasury bills could be appropriate if the Federal Reserve wished to keep its Treasury portfolio neutral with respect to the universe of outstanding Treasury securities. With respect to the Federal Reserve’s agency MBS re- demptions, participants generally noted that MBS prin- cipal prepayments would likely run under the proposed monthly cap in a range of plausible interest rate scenar- ios but that the cap could guard against outsized reduc- tions in the Federal Reserve’s agency MBS holdings in scenarios with especially high prepayments. Some par- ticipants noted that under the proposed approach to running off Treasury and agency securities primarily through adjustments to reinvestments, agency MBS holdings would still make up a sizable share of the Fed- eral Reserve’s asset holdings for many years. Partici- pants generally agreed that after balance sheet runoff was well under way, it will be appropriate to consider sales of agency MBS to enable suitable progress toward a longer-run SOMA portfolio composed primarily of Page 4 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Treasury securities. A Committee decision to implement a program of agency MBS sales would be announced well in advance. Several participants noted the significant uncertainty around the future level of reserves that would be con- sistent with the Committee’s ample-reserves operating framework. Against this backdrop, participants gener- ally agreed that it would be appropriate to first slow and then stop the decline in the size of the balance sheet when reserve balances were above the level the Commit- tee judged to be consistent with ample reserves, thereby allowing reserves to decline more gradually as nonre- serve liabilities increased over time. Participants agreed that lessons learned from the previous balance sheet re- duction episode should inform the Committee’s current approach to reaching ample reserve levels and that close monitoring of money market conditions and indicators of near-ample reserves should help inform adjustments to the pace of runoff. A couple of participants noted that the establishment of the SRF, which did not exist in the previous runoff episode, could address unexpected money market pressures that might emerge if the Com- mittee adopted an approach to balance sheet reduction in which reserves declined relatively rapidly, but several others noted that the facility was not intended as a sub- stitute for ample reserves. Participants generally agreed that it was important for the Committee to be prepared to adjust any of the details of its approach to reducing the size of the balance sheet in light of economic and financial developments. No decision regarding the Committee’s plan to reduce the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet was made at this meeting, but participants agreed they had made substan- tial progress on the plan and that the Committee was well placed to begin the process of reducing the size of the balance sheet as early as after the conclusion of its upcoming meeting in May. Staff Review of the Economic Situation The information available at the time of the March 15– 16 meeting suggested that U.S. real gross domestic prod- uct (GDP) was increasing in the first quarter at a pace that was slower than the rapid gain posted in the fourth quarter of 2021. Labor market conditions improved fur- ther in January and February, and indicators of labor compensation continued to show robust increases. Consumer price inflation through January—as measured by the 12-month percentage change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE)—re- mained elevated. Total nonfarm payroll employment grew strongly in Jan- uary and February. The unemployment rate edged down, on net, from 3.9 percent in December to 3.8 per- cent in February. The unemployment rate for African Americans and for Hispanics declined over this period; however, both rates remained noticeably higher than the national average. The labor force participation rate in- creased in February, as did the employment-to-popula- tion ratio. The private-sector job openings rate in Janu- ary, as measured by the Job Openings and Labor Turn- over Survey, was little changed, on net, from its Novem- ber level and remained well above its pre-pandemic level; the quits rate also remained elevated. Average hourly earnings rose 5.1 percent over the 12 months ending in February, about the same as its year-earlier pace, with widespread increases across industries. Consumer prices continued to rise rapidly. Total PCE price inflation was 6.1 percent over the 12 months end- ing in January, and core PCE price inflation, which ex- cludes changes in consumer energy prices and many consumer food prices, was 5.2 percent over the same pe- riod. The trimmed mean measure of 12-month PCE in- flation constructed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dal- las was 3.5 percent in January, 1.8 percentage points higher than its year-earlier rate of increase. In February, the 12-month change in the consumer price index (CPI) was 7.9 percent, while core CPI inflation was 6.4 percent over the same period. The staff’s common inflation ex- pectations index, which combines information from many indicators of inflation expectations and inflation compensation, had largely leveled off over the fall and was close to its 2014 average. Real PCE appeared to be rising at a faster pace in the first quarter of 2022 than in the fourth quarter of 2021 as social distancing unwound further. Housing demand remained strong, though activity in the residential hous- ing sector continued to be restrained by shortages of construction materials, buildable lots, and other inputs. Available indicators suggested that growth in business fixed investment was picking up in the first quarter as growth in nonresidential structures investment turned positive. Available data suggested that motor vehicle production declined sharply in February as ongoing shortages of semiconductors and other supply chain problems con- tinued to restrain output. Outside of the motor vehicle sector, manufacturing production appeared to have moved up over January and February; however, this in- crease did not appear to reflect a substantial reduction in supply bottlenecks, as many indicators of the state of Minutes of the Meeting of March 15–16, 2022 Page 5 _____________________________________________________________________________________________ bottlenecks showed little sign of improvement over this period. In particular, materials inputs such as electronic components and aluminum remained in short supply, while broad measures of industrial input prices remained elevated. Separately, transportation and distribution ac- tivity continued to be held back by port congestion and a shortage of truck drivers. Available indicators suggested that real government pur- chases were little changed in the first quarter after de- clining in the fourth quarter of 2021. Although real state and local purchases appeared to be rising, federal de- fense purchases appeared to be contracting further in the first quarter. The U.S. international trade deficit widened at the end of last year to a record high and surpassed that high at the beginning of this year. Imports of goods grew rap- idly again in January, led by increases in consumer goods, while exports of goods fell back slightly from elevated fourth-quarter levels. Shipping congestion and other bottlenecks continued to restrain the level of trade in goods. Services exports and imports fell back in January relative to December, reflecting a reduction in travel to and from the United States. Because international travel remained depressed, services trade was still very low rel- ative to pre-pandemic norms. Incoming data suggested that the rapid spread of the Omicron variant had tempered the foreign recovery around the turn of the year. Purchasing managers in- dexes were consistent with the Omicron wave having a notable effect on services activity but a rather muted ef- fect on manufacturing activity and supplier delivery times. Moreover, with COVID-19 cases having fallen in many regions, authorities had already eased restrictions and social mobility had recovered, except in China, where lockdowns were recently reimposed. The Russian invasion of Ukraine, however, constituted another neg- ative shock to the global economy by pushing up com- modity prices further, hurting global risk sentiment, and exacerbating supply bottlenecks. Inflation abroad con- tinued to rise, driven by recovering global demand, rising retail energy and food prices, and ongoing strains on global supply chains; the effects of the Russian invasion contributed to some of these inflationary pressures. Staff Review of the Financial Situation Financial markets were highly volatile over the inter- meeting period, with strained liquidity in some markets. The Russian invasion of Ukraine led to periods of par- ticularly elevated volatility and deteriorating investor risk sentiment. Nominal Treasury yields and the expected path of policy rose during the intermeeting period, driven by economic data releases and FOMC communi- cations that were viewed as implying a more rapid re- moval of monetary policy accommodation than previ- ously expected. Domestic equity indexes declined mod- estly, while those in Europe fell noticeably. Financing conditions remained accommodative, although borrow- ing costs increased further. Investors interpreted incoming economic data and Fed- eral Reserve communications as implying a more rapid removal of monetary policy accommodation than they had previously expected. On net, the expected path of the federal funds rate implied by financial market quotes—unadjusted for term premiums—rose signifi- cantly, along with the yields on nominal Treasury secu- rities, since the previous FOMC meeting. Near-term in- flation compensation implied by Treasury Inflation- Protected Securities rose sharply, reflecting the higher- than-anticipated CPI releases and surging energy prices following the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Spreads of investment- and speculative-grade corporate bonds widened noticeably since the previous FOMC meeting and ended the period close to the medians of their historical distributions. Spreads of municipal bonds also widened significantly across credit categories. Broad equity indexes declined modestly, on net, amid significant fluctuations. Equity prices increased early in the period because of stronger-than-anticipated corpo- rate earnings and economic data releases, but they re- traced these gains as investor risk sentiment deteriorated following the Ukraine invasion. The one-month option- implied volatility on the S&P 500—the VIX—surged briefly immediately following the invasion but ended the intermeeting period slightly lower on net. Foreign asset prices were highly volatile over the inter- meeting period in response to geopolitical develop- ments, central bank communications, and rising infla- tion concerns. News related to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, in particular, contributed to decreases in major foreign equity indexes, especially in Europe, and a mod- erate increase in the broad dollar index. Despite down- ward pressure from the geopolitical events, AFE sover- eign yields increased notably, on net, on higher-than-ex- pected inflation readings and central bank communica- tions that were perceived as less accommodative than expected. EME sovereign spreads widened, and EME- dedicated funds experienced moderate portfolio out- flows, which increased after the Russian invasion. Even so, financial conditions among EMEs—including fund flows and the relative strength of local currencies outside of Europe—were resilient compared with past episodes Page 6 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ of global turbulence, reflecting in part higher commodity prices and monetary policy tightening by EME central banks. Liquidity conditions became strained in some financial markets during the intermeeting period. Market depth—a gauge of the ability to transact in large volumes at quotes posted by market makers—deteriorated in U.S. Treasury, U.S. equity, and crude oil markets. Trading volumes generally remained within normal ranges in most markets and increased above normal levels in Treasury markets later in the period. Bid–ask spreads did not increase notably in most markets. However, in- vestors reported that strained liquidity at times amplified the volatility of price moves and may have contributed to the particularly large swings in Treasury yields and eq- uity prices late in the intermeeting period. Short-term funding markets were mostly stable over the intermeeting period, although spreads in some segments widened. The effective federal funds rate and the Se- cured Overnight Financing Rate generally held steady at 8 basis points and 5 basis points, respectively. Overnight rates on commercial paper (CP) across most sectors also held steady, although rates and spreads on longer-tenor CP and negotiable certificates of deposit increased amid the escalation of the Ukraine invasion. Spreads between three-month forward rate agreements and overnight in- dex swaps widened as borrowers increased precaution- ary issuance of longer-tenor debt while money market investors preferred shorter-duration investments. ON RRP take-up was little changed, averaging about $1.6 trillion. In domestic credit markets, credit remained broadly available for most types of borrowers during the inter- meeting period. Nonfinancial gross corporate bond is- suance slowed noticeably in January and February, re- flecting lower demand for credit due to rising borrowing costs and elevated issuance over the past two years. However, issuance rebounded to healthy levels in March for investment-grade firms, with a few high-yield firms also raising funds. Leveraged loan issuance was strong in January and February. Small business loan origina- tions in December roughly matched pre-pandemic lev- els. The share of small firms that actively sought financ- ing in the past few months and reported that it was more difficult to acquire credit compared with three months earlier remained very low. For households, both nonmortgage and mortgage credit remained accommodative. Credit card balances in- creased significantly in the fourth quarter, and auto credit outstanding grew at a moderate pace in Decem- ber. The number of mortgage rate locks for home pur- chases through February was elevated relative to pre- pandemic levels. Mortgage credit for households with low credit scores continued to ease through February but remained tighter than before the pandemic. The credit quality of large nonfinancial corporations and municipalities remained strong over the intermeeting pe- riod. The volumes of credit rating upgrades for corpo- rate and municipal bonds outpaced those of downgrades moderately in January and February. Default rates on corporate bonds, municipal bonds, and leveraged loans remained very low; most market indicators of future ex- pected default rates for corporate bonds and leveraged loans also remained low. Credit quality in the commercial real estate sector con- tinued to show some signs of stress. Delinquency rates for commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) col- lateralized by hotel and retail properties continued to de- cline in January but remained well above pre-pandemic levels, while those for CMBS in the office sector in- creased somewhat in January but remained fairly low by historical standards. For households, credit quality remained fairly healthy. Delinquency rates for mortgages, which include loans in forbearance and other loans behind on payments, con- tinued to trend down through December, while those for prime auto loan and prime credit card borrowers re- mained flat in December. For nonprime borrowers, de- linquency rates rose in December, although they re- mained subdued by historical standards. Information on borrowing costs through February and early March suggested that the events surrounding Rus- sia’s invasion of Ukraine did not have a significant effect on financing conditions during the intermeeting period. Borrowing costs continued to increase in many sectors but remained low relative to their historical distributions. Spreads in the corporate bond, municipal bond, and CMBS markets generally rose to somewhat above their pre-pandemic levels, reflecting heightened geopolitical risks, uncertainty about the outlook for monetary policy, and elevated financial market volatility. Residential mortgage rates increased, mostly as a result of widening MBS spreads, which market participants attributed mainly to the tapering of the Federal Reserve’s agency MBS purchases and uncertainty surrounding the market supply of agency MBS that would accompany balance sheet runoff by the Federal Reserve. Interest rates on Minutes of the Meeting of March 15–16, 2022 Page 7 _____________________________________________________________________________________________ new credit cards rose to roughly their pre-pandemic lev- els, while rates on auto loans also rose slightly but re- mained significantly below pre-pandemic levels. Staff Economic Outlook The near-term projection for U.S. economic activity pre- pared by the staff for the March FOMC meeting was weaker than in January, reflecting the anticipated eco- nomic effects of the conflict in Ukraine and financial conditions that were expected to be less supportive than previously assumed. For 2022 as a whole, real GDP growth was projected to step down markedly from its rapid 2021 pace before picking up slightly in 2023 as the continued resolution of supply constraints provided a small boost to growth. Real GDP growth was expected to slow further in 2024 to a pace that was in line with potential growth. However, the level of real GDP was expected to remain well above potential over the projec- tion period, and labor market conditions were expected to remain very tight. The staff’s near-term projection for PCE price inflation was revised up considerably relative to January. The up- ward revision reflected the staff’s reaction to the persis- tently high and broad-based levels of domestic inflation, import price inflation, and wage growth that had been observed, as well as the staff’s expectation that the up- ward pressure on inflation from supply and demand im- balances would last longer than previously assumed. In addition, total PCE price inflation was further revised up to reflect higher expected paths for consumer energy and food prices. All told, total PCE price inflation was projected to be 4 percent in 2022. PCE price inflation was then expected to slow to 2.3 percent in 2023 and to 2.1 percent in 2024 as food, energy, and import price in- flation moved lower and as supply and demand imbal- ances were resolved. The staff continued to judge that the risks to the baseline projection for real activity were skewed to the downside and that the risks to the inflation projection were skewed to the upside. The COVID-19 pandemic remained a source of downside risk to activity, while the possibility of more severe and more persistent supply issues was viewed as posing an additional downside risk to activity and an upside risk to inflation. The Russian invasion of Ukraine was perceived as adding to the uncertainty around the outlook for economic activity and inflation, as the conflict carried the risk of further exacerbating supply chain disruptions and of putting additional up- ward pressure on inflation by boosting the prices for en- ergy, food, and other key commodities. Finally, the pos- sibility that continued high inflation would cause longer- term inflation expectations to become unanchored was seen as another upside risk to the inflation projection. Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, participants submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and infla- tion for each year from 2022 through 2024 and over the longer run based on their individual assessments of ap- propriate monetary policy, including the path of the fed- eral funds rate. The longer-run projections represented each participant’s assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, un- der appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy. A Summary of Eco- nomic Projections was released to the public following the conclusion of the meeting. In their discussion of current economic conditions, par- ticipants noted that indicators of economic activity and employment had continued to strengthen. Job gains had been strong in recent months, and the unemployment rate had declined substantially. Inflation remained ele- vated, reflecting continued supply and demand imbal- ances, higher energy prices, and broader price pressures. With appropriate firming in the stance of monetary pol- icy, participants expected inflation to return to the Com- mittee’s 2 percent objective over time and the labor mar- ket to remain strong. Participants recognized that the invasion of Ukraine by Russia was causing tremendous human and economic hardship for the Ukrainian people. They judged that the implications of the war for the U.S. economy were highly uncertain, but in the near term, the invasion and related events were likely to create signifi- cant additional upward pressure on inflation and could weigh on economic activity. With regard to the economic outlook, participants noted that real GDP growth had slowed from its rapid pace in the fourth quarter of 2021, largely reflecting weaker in- ventory investment, but consumption and business in- vestment continued to rise solidly. The Omicron variant left only a mild and brief imprint on economic data, as households and firms appeared resilient to this wave of the virus. Relative to their December forecasts, partici- pants had revised down their projections for real GDP growth this year, reflecting factors such as a slowdown in inventory investment from its strong pace late last year, reduced fiscal and monetary policy accommoda- tion, and the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which had led to higher prices of energy and other commodities, in- creased uncertainty, and weighed on broader financial Page 8 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ conditions and consumer sentiment. Even so, partici- pants judged that economic fundamentals remained solid and that they expected above-trend growth to con- tinue, sustaining a strong labor market. Participants commented that demand for labor contin- ued to substantially exceed available supply across many parts of the economy and that their business contacts continued to report difficulties in hiring and retaining workers. Participants observed that various indicators pointed to a very tight labor market. Employment growth remained strong through the Omicron wave. A couple of participants highlighted that the annual bench- mark revision to the establishment survey employment data revealed stronger employment growth in the second half of 2021 than was initially reported. The unemploy- ment rate had fallen to a post-pandemic low, and quits and job openings were at all-time highs. Although pay- roll employment remained below its pre-pandemic level, the shortfall was concentrated in a few sectors and re- flected a shortage of workers rather than insufficient de- mand for labor. Consistent with a tight labor market, nominal wages were rising at the fastest pace in many years. While wage gains thus far had been the strongest among the lowest quartile of earners and among produc- tion and supervisory workers, wage pressures had begun to spread across the income and skill distributions. Many participants commented that they expected the la- bor market to remain strong and wage pressures to re- main elevated. A few participants noted that there were signs that the pandemic-related factors that had held back labor supply might be abating and pointed to the notable increase in the labor force participation rate among prime-age men in February. Participants remarked that recent inflation readings con- tinued to significantly exceed the Committee’s longer- run goal and noted that developments associated with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, including the related surge in energy prices, will add to near-term inflation pres- sures. Some participants noted that elevated inflation had continued to broaden from goods into services, es- pecially rents, and into sectors that had not yet experi- enced large price increases, such as education, apparel, and health care. A few participants also noted that the number of spending categories experiencing inflation rates above 4 percent had continued to rise, or that the trimmed mean inflation measure from the Federal Re- serve Bank of Dallas had risen to its highest level since the early 1980s. Many participants indicated that their business contacts continued to report substantial in- creases in wages and input prices that were being passed through into higher prices to their customers without any significant decrease in demand. Participants com- mented on a few factors that might lead the high infla- tion readings to persist, including strong aggregate de- mand, significant increases in energy and commodity prices, and supply chain disruptions that were likely to require a lengthy period to resolve. In addition, some participants noted that recent higher inflation could af- fect future inflation dynamics. For example, a few par- ticipants commented that persistently high inflation readings might lead businesses, when setting prices, to be more attentive to aggregate inflation or more willing to raise prices. In addition, a couple of other participants noted that some household survey data suggested that near-term consumer inflation expectations have become more sensitive to actual inflation readings since the be- ginning of the pandemic. A few participants commented that both survey- and market-based measures of short- term inflation expectations were at historically high lev- els. Several other participants noted that longer-term measures of inflation expectations from households, professional forecasters, and market participants still ap- peared to remain well anchored, which—together with appropriate monetary policy and an eventual easing of supply constraints—would support a return of inflation over time to levels consistent with the Committee’s longer-run goal. Participants agreed that developments surrounding the Russian invasion of Ukraine, including the resulting sanctions, were adding to inflation pressures and posing upside risks to the inflation outlook. Participants noted that Russia and Ukraine were major suppliers of various commodities used in the production of energy, food, and some industrial inputs. A continued cutoff of that supply from the world market would further push up prices for those commodities and, over time, lead to price increases in downstream industries. The invasion had also exacerbated the disruptions of supply chains. Participants commented that, by leading to higher en- ergy and food prices, weighing on consumer sentiment, and contributing to tighter financial conditions, the in- vasion also negatively affected the growth outlook. A few participants highlighted additional downside risks to growth associated with the war, such as the risk that a more protracted conflict than the public currently ex- pects could lead to much tighter global financial condi- tions or other disruptions. A couple of participants commented that the increased uncertainty might lead businesses and consumers to reduce spending, though their business contacts currently were not seeing signs of such shifts or expecting a significant pullback in demand. Minutes of the Meeting of March 15–16, 2022 Page 9 _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Several participants judged that the upside risk to infla- tion associated with the war appeared more significant than the downside risk to growth, as inflation was al- ready high, the United States had a relatively low level of financial and trade exposure to Russia, and the U.S. economy was well positioned to absorb additional ad- verse demand shocks. In their discussion of risks to the outlook, participants agreed that uncertainty regarding the path of inflation was elevated and that risks to inflation were weighted to the upside. Participants cited several such risks, includ- ing ongoing supply bottlenecks and rising energy and commodity prices, both of which were exacerbated by the Russian invasion; recent COVID-related lockdowns in China that had the potential to further disrupt supply chains; and the possibility that longer-run inflation ex- pectations might become unanchored. Uncertainty about real activity was also seen as elevated. Various participants noted downside risks to the outlook, includ- ing risks associated with the Russian invasion, a broad tightening in global financial conditions, and a pro- longed rise in energy prices. In their consideration of the appropriate stance of mon- etary policy, all participants concurred that the U.S. economy was very strong, with an extremely tight labor market, and that inflation was high and well above the Committee’s 2 percent inflation objective. Against this backdrop, all participants agreed that it was appropriate to begin a process of removing policy accommodation by raising the target range for the federal funds rate at this meeting. They further judged that ongoing increases in the target range for the federal funds rate would be warranted to achieve the Committee’s objectives. Par- ticipants also agreed that reducing the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet would play an important role in firming the stance of monetary policy and that they ex- pected it would be appropriate to begin this process at a coming meeting, possibly as soon as in May. Partici- pants judged that the firming of monetary policy, along- side an eventual waning of supply–demand imbalances, would help to keep longer-term inflation expectations anchored and bring inflation down over time to levels consistent with the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run goal while sustaining a strong labor market. Many participants noted that—with inflation well above the Committee’s objective, inflationary risks to the up- side, and the federal funds rate well below participants’ estimates of its longer-run level—they would have pre- ferred a 50 basis point increase in the target range for the federal funds rate at this meeting. A number of these participants indicated, however, that, in light of greater near-term uncertainty associated with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, they judged that a 25 basis point increase would be appropriate at this meeting. Many participants noted that one or more 50 basis point increases in the target range could be appropriate at future meetings, particularly if inflation pressures remained elevated or intensified. A number of participants noted that the Committee’s previous communications had already con- tributed to a tightening of financial conditions, as evi- dent in the notable increase in longer-term interest rates over recent months. All participants indicated their strong commitment and determination to take the measures necessary to restore price stability. In that context, participants judged that the Committee’s approach of commencing increases in the target range for the federal funds rate, and indicating that ongoing increases were likely, was fully warranted. Participants judged that it would be appropriate to move the stance of monetary policy toward a neutral posture expeditiously. They also noted that, depending on eco- nomic and financial developments, a move to a tighter policy stance could be warranted. A few participants judged that, at the current juncture, a significant risk fac- ing the Committee was that elevated inflation and infla- tion expectations could become entrenched if the public began to question the Committee’s resolve to adjust the stance of policy as appropriate to achieve the Commit- tee’s 2 percent longer-run objective for inflation. These participants suggested that expediting the removal of policy accommodation would reduce this risk while also leaving the Committee well positioned to adjust the stance of policy if geopolitical and other developments led to a more rapid dissipation of demand pressures than expected. Participants agreed that the economic outlook was highly uncertain and that policy decisions must take ac- count of the state of financial markets and the economy. As always, the Committee would need to be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy in response to the evolving economic outlook and the risks to the outlook. In this regard, participants noted that developments as- sociated with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine posed height- ened risks for both the United States and the global economy. Against this backdrop, all participants judged that risk management would be important in deciding upon the appropriate stance of monetary policy, and that policy also would need to be nimble in responding to incoming data and the evolving outlook. In particular, all participants underscored the need to remain attentive Page 10 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ to the risks of further upward pressure on inflation and longer-run inflation expectations. Committee Policy Action In their discussion of monetary policy for this meeting, members agreed that indicators of economic activity and employment had continued to strengthen. Job gains had been strong in recent months, and the unemployment rate had declined substantially. Members also agreed that inflation remained elevated, reflecting continued supply and demand imbalances, higher energy prices, and broader price pressures. Members agreed that geopolitical developments war- ranted several changes to the postmeeting statement. They concurred that the invasion of Ukraine by Russia was causing tremendous human and economic hardship, and they agreed to update the statement to recognize this tragic situation. Members agreed that the implications of the war for the U.S. economy were highly uncertain, but they judged that, in the near term, the invasion and related events were likely to create additional upward pressure on inflation and weigh on economic activity. In their assessment of the monetary policy stance neces- sary for achieving the Committee’s maximum- employment and price-stability goals, members agreed that with appropriate firming in the stance of monetary policy, they expected inflation to return to the Commit- tee’s 2 percent objective and the labor market to remain strong. In support of these goals, the Committee de- cided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to ¼ to ½ percent and anticipated that ongoing increases in the target range would be appropriate. One member preferred to raise the target range for the federal funds rate by 0.5 percentage point to ½ to ¾ percent at this meeting in light of elevated inflation pressures. With re- gard to reducing the size of the Federal Reserve’s bal- ance sheet, all members agreed that they had made sub- stantial progress on arriving at a plan specifying the steps the Committee would take. They expected that, depend- ing on economic and financial conditions, beginning the process of reducing the size of the balance sheet would be appropriate at a coming meeting, possibly as early as at the Committee’s May meeting. Members agreed that, in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, they would continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and that they would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate in the event that risks emerged that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals. They also concurred that, in as- sessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, they would take into account a wide range of information, in- cluding readings on public health, labor market condi- tions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the fol- lowing domestic policy directive, for release at 2:00 p.m.: “Effective March 17, 2022, the Federal Open Market Committee directs the Desk to: • Undertake open market operations as nec- essary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of ¼ to ½ percent. • Conduct overnight repurchase agreement operations with a minimum bid rate of 0.5 percent and with an aggregate operation limit of $500 billion; the aggregate opera- tion limit can be temporarily increased at the discretion of the Chair. • Conduct overnight reverse repurchase agreement operations at an offering rate of 0.3 percent and with a per-counterparty limit of $160 billion per day; the per- counterparty limit can be temporarily in- creased at the discretion of the Chair. • Roll over at auction all principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of Treasury securities and reinvest all principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s hold- ings of agency debt and agency mortgage- backed securities (MBS) in agency MBS. • Allow modest deviations from stated amounts for reinvestments, if needed for operational reasons. • Engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settle- ment of the Federal Reserve’s agency MBS transactions.” The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below for release at 2:00 p.m.: “Indicators of economic activity and employ- ment have continued to strengthen. Job gains have been strong in recent months, and the un- employment rate has declined substantially. In- flation remains elevated, reflecting supply and Minutes of the Meeting of March 15–16, 2022 Page 11 _____________________________________________________________________________________________ demand imbalances related to the pandemic, higher energy prices, and broader price pres- sures. The invasion of Ukraine by Russia is causing tremendous human and economic hardship. The implications for the U.S. economy are highly uncertain, but in the near term the inva- sion and related events are likely to create addi- tional upward pressure on inflation and weigh on economic activity. The Committee seeks to achieve maximum em- ployment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. With appropriate firming in the stance of monetary policy, the Committee expects inflation to return to its 2 percent ob- jective and the labor market to remain strong. In support of these goals, the Committee de- cided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to ¼ to ½ percent and anticipates that ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate. In addition, the Committee ex- pects to begin reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mort- gage-backed securities at a coming meeting. In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals. The Committee’s assessments will take into account a wide range of information, in- cluding readings on public health, labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation ex- pectations, and financial and international de- velopments.” Voting for this action: Jerome H. Powell, John C. Williams, Michelle W. Bowman, Lael Brainard, Esther L. 5 In taking this action, the Board approved requests to estab- lish the rate submitted by the boards of directors of the Fed- eral Reserve Banks of Boston, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Rich- mond, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and San Francisco. This vote also encompassed approval by the Board of Governors of the establishment of a 0.50 percent primary credit rate by the remaining Federal Reserve Banks, effective on the later of March 17, 2022, and the date such Reserve Banks inform the Secretary of the Board of such a George, Patrick Harker, Loretta J. Mester, and Christopher J. Waller. Voting against this action: James Bullard. Patrick Harker voted as an alternate member at this meeting. President Bullard preferred at this meeting to raise the target range for the federal funds rate by 0.5 percentage point to ½ to ¾ percent in light of elevated inflation pressures. To support the Committee’s decision to raise the target range for the federal funds rate, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted unanimously to raise the interest rate paid on reserve balances to 0.40 percent, effective March 17, 2022. The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted unani- mously to approve a ¼ percentage point increase in the primary credit rate to 0.50 percent, effective March 17, 2022.5 It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Tuesday–Wednesday, May 3–4, 2022.6 The meeting adjourned at 10:30 a.m. on March 16, 2022. Notation Votes By notation vote completed on February 15, 2022, the Committee unanimously approved the minutes of the Committee meeting held on January 25–26, 2022. By notation vote completed on February 17, 2022, the Committee unanimously approved the Investment Trading Policy for FOMC Officials and related revisions to the Program for Security of FOMC information. In conjunction with the notation vote, all non-voting par- ticipants also expressed support for the Policy and re- lated revisions to the Program. _______________________ James A. Clouse Secretary request. (Secretary’s note: Subsequently, the Federal Reserve Banks of New York and Dallas were informed of the Secretary of the Board’s approval of their establishment of a primary credit rate of 0.50 percent, effective March 17, 2022.)

Developments in Financial Markets and Open Market Operations The manager turned first to a discussion of monetary policy expectations in the United States. Federal Re- serve communications since the March FOMC meeting were perceived as signaling a more rapid removal of pol- icy accommodation than had been expected, resulting in significant shifts in expectations regarding the path of the federal funds rate. For the current meeting, federal funds futures implied around 50 basis points of policy rate tightening, and Open Market Desk survey respond- ents assigned an average probability of 80 percent to that outcome. The median Desk survey respondents also projected 50-basis-point increases in the target range at the two following meetings and another 125 basis points of increases by the middle of next year, bringing the pro- jected midpoint of the target range to a peak of 3.13 per- cent—substantially higher than in previous surveys. Market participants continued to note significant uncer- tainty regarding the economic outlook and the degree of policy tightening ahead. This uncertainty was reflected in the dispersion in survey respondents’ average proba- bility distribution for the target range at the end of 2023. Regarding the outlook for runoff of the Federal Re- serve’s securities holdings, market participants widely expected the Committee to announce the commence- ment of balance sheet runoff at the current meeting. Median survey responses suggested that most market participants anticipated maximum redemption caps of $60 billion per month for Treasury securities and $35 billion per month for agency mortgage-backed secu- rities (MBS), with the caps phased in over roughly three months. Survey responses continued to reflect substan- tial dispersion in views on the level of System Open Mar- ket Account (SOMA) holdings at which balance sheet runoff would end. The manager turned next to a discussion of U.S. finan- cial market developments. Financial conditions tight- ened notably over the period. Treasury yields increased across the curve, with the rise primarily reflecting higher real interest rates. Longer-term private borrowing rates also moved higher, with 30-year fixed-rate mortgage rates rising above 5 percent to the highest levels in over a decade. Equity indexes ended the period substantially lower, on net. These indexes moved up earlier in the period in connection with a perceived reduction in tail risks stemming from the war in Ukraine but then moved lower, reportedly because of increased caution regarding 4 Attended the discussion of economic developments and out- look. Page 2 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ the economic outlook amid the expected tightening in U.S. monetary policy. The dollar appreciated, leaving the broad trade-weighted dollar up around 2 percent over the period. Viewed over a longer time horizon, fi- nancial conditions, as measured by many financial con- ditions indexes, had tightened by historically large amounts since the beginning of the year. Market- and survey-based measures of U.S. inflation ex- pectations continued to project a significant deceleration in inflation in the coming years. Nonetheless, far-for- ward inflation compensation rose over the period, and market participants remained attentive to the risk that, in bringing inflation back to 2 percent, the Committee would need to tighten by more than currently expected. In global financial developments, many advanced-econ- omy central banks raised policy rates over the period, and investors increasingly came to anticipate tighter monetary policy ahead in most advanced foreign econo- mies. The Bank of Japan was an exception and was widely anticipated to maintain its accommodative poli- cies. The yen depreciated 9 percent against the dollar over the intermeeting period to its weakest level in over two decades. Emerging market (EM) currencies re- mained relatively resilient. Market participants focused on the spread of COVID-19 in China and the effect of zero-COVID policies, which had resulted in increasingly widespread lockdowns. The renminbi depreciated against the dollar around 4 percent over the intermeeting period. The manager turned next to a discussion of develop- ments in money markets. The effective federal funds rate rose 25 basis points following the increase in the target range at the March FOMC meeting and remained stable throughout the period. Secured overnight rates also rose by 25 basis points following the March meet- ing, though modest softness emerged in subsequent days. Market participants noted that ongoing uncer- tainty about the near-term path of Federal Reserve pol- icy had increased demand for very short-dated invest- ments. This demand, combined with declining Treasury bill supply, contributed to the downward pressure on se- cured rates and to rising overnight reverse repurchase agreement (ON RRP) usage. The manager expected that ON RRP usage could remain elevated in coming months but anticipated that, over the longer term, usage would decline as balance sheet reduction proceeded. The manager indicated that the Desk was prepared to implement the Committee’s plan for balance sheet re- duction and that, in the event that the Committee an- nounced the plan at the end of the current meeting, the Desk would issue a statement and FAQs providing the public with details regarding the implementation of the plan. The Desk would closely monitor market condi- tions and update the Committee during the runoff pro- cess. The deputy SOMA manager reviewed developments concerning Desk operations. The Desk planned to in- crease the publication frequency of data on ON RRP us- age. This additional information would provide the pub- lic with greater transparency about usage of the ON RRP facility. The Desk planned to publish the SOMA annual report soon. In addition to the detailed review of open market operations over 2021, the report would include updated illustrative projections of the size and composi- tion of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet over coming years. With respect to other operational matters, the Desk continued to work on details of plans for agency MBS CUSIP (Committee on Uniform Security Identifi- cation Procedures) aggregation and anticipated that this process would begin in coming months. Finally, the deputy manager requested that the Committee vote to maintain the standing U.S. dollar and foreign currency liquidity swap arrangements and to renew the reciprocal currency arrangements with Canada and Mexico under the North American Framework Agreement. In their discussion, participants widely agreed that the standing swap lines are a critical tool allowing the Federal Reserve to address global dollar funding pressures that could otherwise adversely affect the U.S. economy. The Committee voted unanimously to renew the recip- rocal currency arrangements with the Bank of Canada and the Bank of Mexico; these arrangements are associ- ated with the Federal Reserve’s participation in the North American Framework Agreement of 1994. In ad- dition, the Committee voted unanimously to renew the dollar and foreign currency liquidity swap arrangements with the Bank of Canada, the Bank of England, the Bank of Japan, the European Central Bank, and the Swiss Na- tional Bank. The votes to renew the Federal Reserve’s participation in these standing arrangements occur an- nually at the April or May FOMC meeting. By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk’s domestic transactions over the intermeeting period. There were no intervention operations in foreign curren- cies for the System’s account during the intermeeting pe- riod. Staff Review of the Economic Situation The information available at the time of the May 3–4 meeting suggested that U.S. real gross domestic product _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Minutes of the Meeting of May 3–4, 2022 Page 3 (GDP) declined in the first quarter. However, first-quar- ter growth in private domestic final demand was faster than in the previous quarter, while labor market condi- tions tightened further in March. Consumer price infla- tion through March—as measured by the 12-month per- centage change in the price index for personal consump- tion expenditures (PCE)—remained elevated. Total nonfarm payroll employment rose in March, and the unemployment rate declined to 3.6 percent. The un- employment rates for African Americans and for His- panics moved lower, though both rates remained notice- ably higher than the national average. The labor force participation rate increased in March, as did the employ- ment-to-population ratio. The private-sector job open- ings rate, as measured by the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, remained elevated. The employment cost index of hourly compensation in the private sector rose 4.8 percent over the 12 months ending in March; this gain was much larger than the corresponding 12-month changes posted in each of the preceding four years and was the largest 12-month increase since 1990. Consumer prices continued to rise rapidly. Total PCE price inflation was 6.6 percent over the 12 months end- ing in March, and core PCE price inflation, which ex- cludes changes in consumer energy prices and many consumer food prices, was 5.2 percent over the same pe- riod. The trimmed mean measure of 12-month PCE price inflation constructed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas was 3.7 percent in March, 2 percentage points higher than its year-earlier rate of increase. A new ver- sion of the staff’s common inflation expectations index, which combines information from many indicators of inflation expectations and inflation compensation, moved up in the first quarter and was at the upper end of the range of values seen since 2005. Both real PCE and residential investment increased in the first quarter at rates similar to those seen in the fourth quarter of 2021. Business fixed investment growth picked up sharply in the first quarter, with spend- ing on equipment and intellectual property products posting a large increase. Inventory investment moved lower after surging in the fourth quarter of 2021, and total real government purchases declined further, led by a drop in defense purchases. The U.S. international trade deficit widened further in the first quarter of this year, and net exports made a large negative contribution to real U.S. GDP growth. Goods imports continued the fourth quarter’s strong growth, driven by large increases in real imports of consumer goods, capital goods, and automotive products. By con- trast, real exports of goods fell back after rising briskly late last year, with broad-based declines in most major categories. Both real exports and imports of services grew at a moderate pace in the first quarter, though both were held back by a tepid recovery in international travel amid ongoing waves of COVID-19. Data suggested that foreign economic growth remained solid in the first quarter, as most economies continued to show adaptability to new COVID-19 waves. Chinese data for March and April, however, showed declines in manufacturing and services activity and worsening sup- ply bottlenecks after Chinese authorities locked down Shanghai and other cities to combat the spread of the Omicron variant. The ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine also left its imprint on foreign economies, with consumer and business sentiment declining in Europe and global prices of a range of commodities continuing to rise. Foreign inflation increased significantly further, driven by surging energy and food prices as well as some broadening of price pressures to core goods and ser- vices. In response, many central banks around the world tightened their monetary policy stances. Staff Review of the Financial Situation U.S. Treasury yields and the market-implied federal funds rate path moved substantially higher over the in- termeeting period as Federal Reserve communications and domestic economic data releases were perceived as suggesting that a more aggressive tightening of monetary policy was likely over coming months. Sovereign yields in advanced foreign economies (AFEs) also increased notably. Broad domestic equity price indexes declined on net, and the one-month option-implied volatility on the S&P 500 index—the VIX—remained elevated. Short-term funding markets were stable, while participa- tion in the ON RRP facility increased further. Amid the increase in Treasury yields, borrowing costs increased in many sectors and were at or somewhat above pre-pan- demic levels. Since the March FOMC meeting, 2-, 5-, and 10-year Treasury yields increased significantly on net. The in- creases in nominal Treasury yields were primarily ac- counted for by rising real yields, while inflation compen- sation implied by Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities was little changed. Alongside moves in shorter-term Treasury yields, the expected federal funds rate path— implied by a straight read of overnight index swap quotes—rose notably since the March FOMC meeting. Page 4 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Broad equity indexes decreased over the intermeeting period. Early in the period, equity prices increased, sup- ported by the robust pace of economic activity and re- duced market concerns about the implications for the global economy of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The initial sharp gains in stock prices were followed by larger declines later in the period, as longer-term interest rates rose substantially and as some disappointing earnings re- ports toward the end of the intermeeting period weighed on equity prices. The VIX declined substantially early in the period but ended the period little changed on net, remaining at elevated levels. Similarly, spreads on invest- ment- and speculative-grade corporate bonds narrowed moderately earlier in the intermeeting period and then widened, ending the period only slightly narrower, on net, and below the median of their historical distribution. Spreads on municipal bonds were up modestly and stood at about the 90th percentile of their historical dis- tribution. Conditions in short-term funding markets remained sta- ble over the intermeeting period, with the March in- crease in the Federal Reserve’s administered rates pass- ing through to overnight money market rates. Secured overnight rates softened later in the period, with down- ward pressure on rates attributed to continuing declines in net Treasury bill issuance, increased activity in certain segments of the repo market that tend to trade at lower rates, and money market funds continuing to shorten portfolio maturities amid uncertainty about the pace of anticipated policy rate increases. Consistent with the downward pressure on repo rates, daily take-up in the ON RRP facility remained elevated. Spreads on most types of longer-tenor commercial pa- per and negotiable certificates of deposit narrowed, re- portedly reflecting reduced market concerns about the effects of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, although some of the spreads remained slightly wider than those seen earlier this year. Over the intermeeting period, sovereign yields in AFEs increased notably because of concerns about further in- flationary pressures, some central bank communications that were perceived as less accommodative than ex- pected, and spillovers from rises in U.S. Treasury yields. Prospects of tighter monetary policy and COVID-re- lated lockdowns in China weighed on prices of risky as- sets, but investor concerns surrounding the economic effects of the war in Ukraine seemed to abate partially. On balance, major foreign equity indexes registered mixed and relatively modest changes. The U.S. dollar generally strengthened, with a more pronounced dollar appreciation against AFE currencies, as U.S. Treasury yields generally rose more than their AFE counterparts. Among EM currencies, the dollar appreciated signifi- cantly against the Chinese renminbi. Over the intermeeting period, along with the increase in Treasury yields, borrowing costs increased in many sec- tors and were at or somewhat above pre-pandemic lev- els. Credit remained widely available, and borrower credit quality continued to be strong overall. Borrowing costs for residential mortgage loans increased substantially, with the 30-year mortgage offer rates reaching levels not seen since 2010. This increase largely reflected the rise in the 10-year Treasury yield. Corpo- rate bond yields also increased, although the effect of the increase in Treasury yields was partly offset by narrower spreads. Municipal bond yields also increased notably. Bank loan rates for commercial borrowers increased and rates on large syndicated loans were roughly in line with pre-pandemic levels. In consumer credit markets, rates on auto loans and new credit card offers continued to trend upward. Credit, which remained widely available for most types of borrowers, was broadly in line with pre-pandemic lev- els. Gross nonfinancial corporate bond issuance re- bounded sharply in March, mostly reflecting an increase in investment-grade issuance, while gross institutional leveraged loan issuance slowed amid elevated geopoliti- cal uncertainty. Commercial and industrial (C&I) loans and commercial real estate (CRE) loans on bank balance sheets also grew robustly in March. Respondents in the April Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Prac- tices (SLOOS) reported a continued easing of lending terms and strengthening demand for C&I loans as well as easing standards for multifamily CRE loans. For most small businesses, credit appeared to be availa- ble, although these businesses’ demand for credit report- edly remained weak. In the April SLOOS, large banks reported unchanged standards on C&I loans to small firms, while small banks tightened standards modestly to such firms. In consumer credit markets, credit card balances grew strongly in the first quarter amid easing standards and greater utilization, and auto credit outstanding continued to grow steadily through February despite vehicle pro- duction shortfalls and low vehicle inventories. Residen- tial mortgage credit conditions remained accommoda- _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Minutes of the Meeting of May 3–4, 2022 Page 5 tive through March, despite the increase in mortgage in- terest rates, particularly for stronger borrowers who met standard loan criteria. The credit quality of firms, municipalities, and house- holds remained strong overall. The volume of credit rat- ing upgrades for corporate bonds outpaced downgrades moderately in March, continuing a nearly yearlong pat- tern. The credit quality of C&I loans on banks’ books continued to be strong as delinquency and default rates both remained low. Delinquency rates on bank and nonbank loans to small businesses edged down in Feb- ruary, while in the CRE sector, borrower financial health continued to recover. Household credit quality re- mained strong, and delinquency rates across both prime and nonprime borrowers continued to be subdued by historical standards. The staff provided an update on its assessment of the stability of the financial system. The staff judged that, amid a substantial upward shift in interest rates, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and ongoing disruptions to supply chains, the financial system—outside of commodities markets—had been resilient. However, larger or pro- longed disruptions in commodities markets could inter- fere with other markets and real activity more broadly. To date, however, such potential spillovers appeared to be limited. The staff noted that increased uncertainty and ongoing volatility had reduced risk appetite in financial markets and eased price pressures, although valuations of many assets remained elevated. CRE valuations appeared somewhat elevated except for sectors that were affected most by the pandemic. Residential house prices had risen rapidly, although the staff continued to see key dif- ferences from the previous debt-fueled housing boom: The mortgage finance reforms enacted after 2008 lim- ited the potential for significant deterioration in under- writing standards, most new mortgage debt had been added by borrowers with prime credit scores, and home- owners’ equity positions were healthy. The staff assessed that aggregate household and business leverage was moderate. Households’ debt-to-GDP ratio remained relatively low, and there were few signs of in- creased stress among lower-income households. Busi- ness debt remained elevated relative to its pre-pandemic history, but interest coverage ratios were high. The staff assessed that vulnerabilities arising from finan- cial leverage remained moderate on balance. Despite market volatility, the banking sector continued to be well capitalized with strong liquidity. The staff noted that leverage at key nonbank financial institutions (NBFIs) was elevated and that bank lending to NBFIs continued to increase notably. Relatedly, NBFIs’ reliance on bank credit lines to meet unexpected liquidity needs could generate moderate liquidity pressures at large banks dur- ing times of financial stress. With regard to funding risk, the staff highlighted structural vulnerabilities in some types of mutual funds as a continuing focus. Staff Economic Outlook The projection for U.S. economic activity prepared by the staff for the May FOMC meeting implied a trajectory for real GDP that was broadly similar to the March pro- jection. The staff noted that the first-quarter decline in real GDP was driven by categories of spending that had often been volatile in the past, and they viewed the con- tinued strength in private domestic final demand, the la- bor market, and industrial production as providing a more accurate picture of the economy’s direction in the first quarter. The staff therefore anticipated that GDP growth would rebound in the second quarter and ad- vance at a solid pace over the remainder of the year. GDP growth was then expected to slow in 2023 and 2024 as monetary policy became less accommodative and financial conditions tightened further; by 2024, real GDP growth was expected to be in line with potential output growth. However, the level of real GDP was ex- pected to remain well above potential over the projec- tion period, and labor market conditions were expected to remain very tight. The staff’s projection for PCE price inflation was re- vised up slightly in the second half of 2022 and in 2023 in response to the slow resolution of supply constraints seen over the first part of 2022, a higher projected path for import prices, and a judgment that wage increases would put more upward pressure on services prices than previously assumed. All told, total PCE price inflation was expected to be 4.3 percent in 2022. PCE price in- flation was then expected to step down to 2.5 percent in 2023 and to 2.1 percent in 2024 as supply–demand im- balances in the economy were reduced by slowing aggre- gate demand and an anticipated easing of supply con- straints. The staff continued to judge that the risks to the baseline projection for real activity were skewed to the downside and that the risks to the inflation projection were skewed to the upside. The war in Ukraine was seen as a possible source of even greater upward pressure on energy and commodity prices, while the war and adverse develop- ments associated with rising COVID infections in China were both perceived as increasing the risk that supply Page 6 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ chain disruptions and production constraints would be further exacerbated in the United States and abroad. Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook In their discussion of current economic conditions, par- ticipants noted that, although overall economic activity had edged down in the first quarter, household spending and business fixed investment had remained strong. Job gains had been robust in recent months, and the unem- ployment rate had declined substantially. Inflation re- mained elevated, reflecting continued supply and de- mand imbalances, higher energy prices, and broader price pressures. Participants recognized that the inva- sion of Ukraine by Russia was causing tremendous hu- man and economic hardship for the Ukrainian people. Participants judged that the implications for the U.S. economy were highly uncertain. The invasion and re- lated events were creating additional upward pressure on inflation and were likely to weigh on economic activity. In addition, participants judged that COVID-related lockdowns in China were likely to exacerbate supply chain disruptions. Against this background, participants stated that they were highly attentive to inflation risks. Participants commented that after its rapid growth in the last quarter of 2021, real GDP had declined in the first quarter of this year, with net exports and inventory in- vestment making large negative contributions to growth. They noted, however, that these volatile components tended to contain little signal about subsequent growth and that household spending and business fixed invest- ment had remained strong in the first quarter. These advances and the further tightening of labor market con- ditions were judged consistent with significant underly- ing momentum in the domestic economy. In line with this judgment, participants expected that real GDP would grow solidly in the current quarter. In their dis- cussion of the economic outlook beyond the near term, participants indicated that they expected that output would expand more moderately this year than in 2021, with growth this year likely near or above its longer-run rate, and that the imbalance between aggregate demand and aggregate supply would diminish over time. Partic- ipants saw an appropriate firming of monetary policy as playing a central role in addressing this imbalance and in supporting the Federal Reserve’s goals of maximum em- ployment and price stability. An easing of supply bottle- necks, a further rise in labor force participation, and the waning effects of pandemic-related fiscal policy support were cited as additional factors that could help reduce the supply–demand imbalances in the economy and lower inflation over the medium term. That said, the timing and magnitude of these effects were uncertain. Participants recognized the need to adjust the stance of policy depending on how these and other factors played out over time. In their discussion of the household sector, participants indicated that they expected robust growth in consump- tion spending. They pointed to several elements sup- porting this outlook, including strong household balance sheets, wide availability of jobs, and the U.S. economy’s resilience in the face of new waves of the virus. The considerable increases in Treasury yields across maturi- ties over the intermeeting period were associated with rising interest rates faced by households, particularly rates on home mortgages. A couple of participants re- ported that their business contacts continued to see ro- bust housing demand and elevated home prices despite higher mortgage interest rates. With respect to the business sector, participants cited ro- bust consumer demand, healthy household balance sheets, and inventory rebuilding as factors supportive of business activity and investment. The ability of firms to meet demand continued to be limited by labor shortages and supply chain bottlenecks. Although some partici- pants noted that their business contacts had reported an easing of supply constraints, participants assessed that supply constraints overall were still significant and would likely take some time to be resolved. In addition, the invasion of Ukraine by Russia and COVID-related lockdowns in China were seen as likely to exacerbate supply chain disruptions. A few participants indicated that some of their business contacts were reportedly hes- itant to expand capacity or had postponed construction projects. Participants commented that demand for labor contin- ued to outstrip available supply across many parts of the economy and that their business contacts continued to report difficulties in hiring and retaining workers. They observed that various indicators pointed to a very tight labor market. Employment growth had continued at a strong pace, the unemployment rate had fallen to a near- 50-year low, quits and job openings had remained ex- tremely elevated, and nominal wages had continued to rise rapidly. A few participants noted that there were signs that the pandemic-related factors that had held back labor supply might be abating further, especially in the case of prime-age workers. In addition, a few other participants suggested that the unwelcome erosion of real incomes due to high inflation may have contributed to the increase in labor supply. Many participants indi- cated that they expected the labor market to remain tight _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Minutes of the Meeting of May 3–4, 2022 Page 7 and wage pressures to stay elevated for some time. Sev- eral participants raised the possibility that, in light of the exceptionally high ratio of vacancies to job searchers, a moderation in labor demand might serve to reduce va- cancies and wage pressures without having significant ef- fects on the unemployment rate. Participants observed that inflation continued to run well above the Committee’s longer-run goal and that in- flation pressures were evident in a broad array of goods and services. Various participants remarked on the hardship caused by elevated inflation and heightened in- flation uncertainty—including by eroding American families’ real incomes and wealth and by making it more difficult for businesses to make production and invest- ment plans. They also pointed out that high inflation could impede the achievement of maximum employ- ment on a sustained basis. Participants noted that devel- opments associated with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, including surges in energy and commodity prices, were adding to near-term inflation pressures. In addition, COVID-related lockdowns in China were likely to dis- rupt global supply chains, potentially adding further up- ward pressure on the prices paid by U.S. businesses and consumers. Most participants indicated that their busi- ness contacts had continued to report that substantial in- creases in wages and input prices were being passed through into higher prices to their customers. A few participants added that some of their contacts were start- ing to report that higher prices were hurting sales. A number of participants observed that recent monthly data might suggest that overall price pressures may no longer be worsening. These participants also empha- sized that price pressures remained elevated and that it was too early to be confident that inflation had peaked. Many participants commented that measures of short- term inflation expectations were elevated or that far-for- ward measures of inflation compensation were near the upper edge of their historical range. Several participants judged that measures of longer-term inflation expecta- tions derived from surveys of households, professional forecasters, and market participants still appeared to be broadly consistent with the Committee’s longer-run in- flation objective, likely reflecting respondents’ confi- dence that the Federal Reserve would take the actions necessary to return inflation to 2 percent. They noted that, together with appropriate firming of monetary pol- icy and an eventual easing of supply constraints, well- anchored longer-term inflation expectations would sup- port a return of inflation to levels consistent with the Committee’s longer-run goal. In their discussion of risks to the outlook, participants emphasized that they were highly attentive to inflation risks and would continue to monitor closely inflation de- velopments and inflation expectations. They agreed that risks to inflation were skewed to the upside and cited several such risks, including those associated with ongo- ing supply bottlenecks and rising energy and commodity prices—both of which were exacerbated by the Russian invasion of Ukraine and COVID-related lockdowns in China. Also mentioned were the risks associated with nominal wage growth continuing to run above levels consistent with 2 percent inflation over time and the ex- tent to which households’ high savings since the onset of the pandemic and healthy balance sheets would sup- port greater-than-expected underlying momentum in consumer spending and contribute to upside inflation pressures. In addition, some participants emphasized that persistently high inflation heightened the risk that longer-term inflation expectations could become unan- chored; in that case, the task of returning inflation to 2 percent would be more difficult. Uncertainty about real activity was also seen as elevated. Various partici- pants noted downside risks to the outlook, including risks associated with the Russian invasion and COVID- related lockdowns in China and the likelihood of a pro- longed rise in energy and commodity prices. Several participants who commented on issues related to financial stability noted that the tightening of monetary policy could interact with vulnerabilities related to the liquidity of markets for Treasury securities and to the private sector’s intermediation capacity. A couple of participants pointed to increased risks in financial mar- kets linked to commodities following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which had led to higher prices and volatility across a wide range of energy, agricultural, and metal products. These participants observed that the trading and risk-management practices of some key participants in commodities markets were not fully visible to regula- tory authorities and noted that central counterparties (CCPs) needed to remain capable of managing risks as- sociated with heightened volatility or that margin re- quirements at CCPs could give rise to significant liquid- ity demands for large banks, broker-dealers, and their cli- ents. In their consideration of the appropriate stance of mon- etary policy, all participants concurred that the U.S. economy was very strong, the labor market was ex- tremely tight, and inflation was very high and well above the Committee’s 2 percent inflation objective. Against this backdrop, all participants agreed that it was appro- priate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate Page 8 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ 50 basis points at this meeting. They further anticipated that ongoing increases in the target range for the federal funds rate would be warranted to achieve the Commit- tee’s objectives. Participants also agreed that it was ap- propriate to start reducing the size of the Federal Re- serve’s balance sheet on June 1, as described in the Plans for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve’s Balance Sheet that would be issued in conjunction with the postmeeting statement. Participants judged that an ap- propriate firming of the stance of monetary policy, along with an eventual waning of supply–demand imbalances, would help to keep longer-term inflation expectations anchored and bring inflation down over time to levels consistent with the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run goal. All participants reaffirmed their strong commitment and determination to take the measures necessary to restore price stability. To this end, participants agreed that the Committee should expeditiously move the stance of monetary policy toward a neutral posture, through both increases in the target range for the federal funds rate and reductions in the size of the Federal Reserve’s bal- ance sheet. Most participants judged that 50 basis point increases in the target range would likely be appropriate at the next couple of meetings. Many participants as- sessed that the Committee’s previous communications had been helpful in shifting market expectations regard- ing the policy outlook into better alignment with the Committee’s assessment and had contributed to the tightening of financial conditions. All participants supported the plans for reducing the size of the balance sheet. This reduction, starting on June 1, would work in parallel with increases in the target range for the policy rate in firming the stance of monetary pol- icy. A number of participants remarked that, after bal- ance sheet runoff was well under way, it would be ap- propriate for the Committee to consider sales of agency MBS to enable suitable progress toward a longer-run SOMA portfolio composed primarily of Treasury secu- rities. Any program of sales of agency MBS would be announced well in advance. Regarding risks related to the balance sheet reduction, several participants noted the potential for unanticipated effects on financial mar- ket conditions. Participants agreed that the economic outlook was highly uncertain and that policy decisions should be data dependent and focused on returning inflation to the Committee’s 2 percent goal while sustaining strong labor market conditions. At present, participants judged that it was important to move expeditiously to a more neutral monetary policy stance. They also noted that a restric- tive stance of policy may well become appropriate de- pending on the evolving economic outlook and the risks to the outlook. Participants observed that developments associated with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the COVID-related lockdowns in China posed heightened risks for both the United States and economies around the world. Several participants commented on the chal- lenges that monetary policy faced in restoring price sta- bility while also maintaining strong labor market condi- tions. In light of the high degree of uncertainty sur- rounding the economic outlook, participants judged that risk-management considerations would be important in deliberations over time regarding the appropriate policy stance. Many participants judged that expediting the re- moval of policy accommodation would leave the Com- mittee well positioned later this year to assess the effects of policy firming and the extent to which economic de- velopments warranted policy adjustments. Committee Policy Action In their discussion of monetary policy for this meeting, members agreed that, although overall economic activity had edged down in the first quarter, household spending and business fixed investment had remained strong. Job gains had been robust in recent months, and the unem- ployment rate had declined substantially. Members also agreed that inflation remained elevated, reflecting con- tinued supply and demand imbalances, higher energy prices, and broader price pressures. Members concurred that the invasion of Ukraine by Russia was causing tremendous human and economic hardship. Members judged that the implications of the war for the U.S. economy were highly uncertain. Mem- bers agreed that the invasion and related events were cre- ating additional upward pressure on inflation and were likely to weigh on economic activity. Members also agreed that COVID-related lockdowns in China were likely to exacerbate supply chain disruptions. In light of continuing inflation risks, members judged that it would be appropriate for the postmeeting statement to note that the Committee is highly attentive to the upside risks to inflation. In their assessment of the monetary policy stance neces- sary for achieving the Committee’s maximum-employ- ment and price-stability goals, members agreed that, with appropriate firming in the stance of monetary pol- icy, they expected inflation to return to the Committee’s 2 percent objective and the labor market to remain strong. In support of these goals, the Committee de- cided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Minutes of the Meeting of May 3–4, 2022 Page 9 to ¾ to 1 percent and anticipated that ongoing increases in the target range would be appropriate. In addition, the Committee decided to begin reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mort- gage-backed securities on June 1, as described in the Plans for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve’s Bal- ance Sheet that were issued in conjunction with the postmeeting statement. Members agreed that, in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, they would continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and that they would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate in the event that risks emerged that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals. They also concurred that their assessments would take into account a wide range of in- formation, including readings on public health, labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation ex- pectations, and financial and international develop- ments. Following the monetary policy discussion, which in- cluded a consideration of plans for reducing the size of the balance sheet, all participants indicated support for the proposed plans for reducing the size of the balance sheet. The Committee voted unanimously to adopt the Plans for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve’s Bal- ance Sheet, as shown below. PLANS FOR REDUCING THE SIZE OF THE FED- ERAL RESERVE’S BALANCE SHEET (as adopted effective May 4, 2022) Consistent with the Principles for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve’s Balance Sheet that were issued in January 2022, all Committee participants agreed to the following plans for significantly reducing the Federal Re- serve’s securities holdings. • The Committee intends to reduce the Fed- eral Reserve’s securities holdings over time in a predictable manner primarily by adjust- ing the amounts reinvested of principal pay- ments received from securities held in the System Open Market Account (SOMA). Beginning on June 1, principal payments from securities held in the SOMA will be reinvested to the extent that they exceed monthly caps. o For Treasury securities, the cap will in- itially be set at $30 billion per month and after three months will increase to $60 billion per month. The decline in holdings of Treasury securities under this monthly cap will include Treasury coupon securities and, to the extent that coupon maturities are less than the monthly cap, Treasury bills. o For agency debt and agency mortgage- backed securities, the cap will initially be set at $17.5 billion per month and after three months will increase to $35 billion per month. • Over time, the Committee intends to main- tain securities holdings in amounts needed to implement monetary policy efficiently and effectively in its ample reserves regime. o To ensure a smooth transition, the Committee intends to slow and then stop the decline in the size of the bal- ance sheet when reserve balances are somewhat above the level it judges to be consistent with ample reserves. o Once balance sheet runoff has ceased, reserve balances will likely continue to decline for a time, reflecting growth in other Federal Reserve liabilities, until the Committee judges that reserve bal- ances are at an ample level. o Thereafter, the Committee will manage securities holdings as needed to main- tain ample reserves over time. • The Committee is prepared to adjust any of the details of its approach to reducing the size of the balance sheet in light of eco- nomic and financial developments. After adopting the Plans for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve’s Balance Sheet, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the following domestic policy directive, for release at 2:00 p.m.: “Effective May 5, 2022, the Federal Open Mar- ket Committee directs the Desk to: • Undertake open market operations as nec- essary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of ¾ to 1 percent. • Conduct overnight repurchase agreement operations with a minimum bid rate of Page 10 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ 1.0 percent and with an aggregate opera- tion limit of $500 billion; the aggregate op- eration limit can be temporarily increased at the discretion of the Chair. • Conduct overnight reverse repurchase agreement operations at an offering rate of 0.8 percent and with a per-counterparty limit of $160 billion per day; the per-coun- terparty limit can be temporarily increased at the discretion of the Chair. • Roll over at auction the amount of princi- pal payments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of Treasury securities maturing in the calendar month of June that exceeds a monthly cap of $30 billion. Redeem Treasury coupon securities up to this monthly cap and Treasury bills to the ex- tent that coupon principal payments are less than the monthly cap. • Reinvest into agency mortgage-backed se- curities (MBS) the amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s hold- ings of agency debt and agency MBS re- ceived in the calendar month of June that exceeds a monthly cap of $17.5 billion. • Allow modest deviations from stated amounts for reinvestments, if needed for operational reasons. • Engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settle- ment of the Federal Reserve’s agency MBS transactions.” The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below for release at 2:00 p.m.: “Although overall economic activity edged down in the first quarter, household spending and business fixed investment remained strong. Job gains have been robust in recent months, and the unemployment rate has declined sub- stantially. Inflation remains elevated, reflecting supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic, higher energy prices, and broader price pressures. The invasion of Ukraine by Russia is causing tremendous human and economic hardship. The implications for the U.S. economy are highly uncertain. The invasion and related events are creating additional upward pressure on inflation and are likely to weigh on economic activity. In addition, COVID-related lock- downs in China are likely to exacerbate supply chain disruptions. The Committee is highly at- tentive to inflation risks. The Committee seeks to achieve maximum em- ployment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. With appropriate firming in the stance of monetary policy, the Committee expects inflation to return to its 2 percent ob- jective and the labor market to remain strong. In support of these goals, the Committee de- cided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to ¾ to 1 percent and anticipates that ongoing increases in the target range will be ap- propriate. In addition, the Committee decided to begin reducing its holdings of Treasury secu- rities and agency debt and agency mortgage- backed securities on June 1, as described in the Plans for Reducing the Size of the Federal Re- serve’s Balance Sheet that were issued in con- junction with this statement. In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals. The Committee’s assessments will take into account a wide range of information, in- cluding readings on public health, labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation ex- pectations, and financial and international de- velopments.” Voting for this action: Jerome H. Powell, John C. Williams, Michelle W. Bowman, Lael Brainard, James Bullard, Esther L. George, Patrick Harker, Loretta J. Mester, and Christopher J. Waller. Patrick Harker voted as an alternate member at this meeting. To support the Committee’s decision to raise the target range for the federal funds rate, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted unanimously to raise the interest rate paid on reserve balances to 0.90 percent, effective May 5, 2022. The Board of Gov- ernors of the Federal Reserve System voted unanimously _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Minutes of the Meeting of May 3–4, 2022 Page 11 to approve a ½ percentage point increase in the primary credit rate to 1 percent, effective May 5, 2022.5 It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Tuesday–Wednesday, June 14–15, 2022.

James P. Bergin, Marc Giannoni, Giovanni Olivei, Paolo A. Pesenti, and Robert G. Valletta, Senior Vice Presidents, Federal Reserve Banks of New York, Dallas, Boston, New York, and San Francisco, respectively Roc Armenter, Vice President, Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia Alisdair G. McKay, Senior Research Economist, Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis Developments in Financial Markets and Open Market Operations The manager of the System Open Market Account (SOMA) turned first to a discussion of financial devel- opments. Over the intermeeting period, there were sig- nificant swings in asset prices, and financial conditions tightened, on net, as market participants assessed incom- ing information about the economy. In the United States, near-term policy rate expectations shifted mark- edly toward the end of the period, particularly after the release of the May consumer price index (CPI) report. Ahead of the release of the report, market expectations reflected a broad consensus that there would be 50 basis point rate increases at both the June and July FOMC meetings. After the release of the higher-than-expected inflation data, policy-sensitive rates pointed instead to a considerable probability of 75 basis point moves at both the June and July meetings. The market-implied path of the federal funds rate moved higher at longer horizons as well. Market participants noted elevated uncertainty about the economic and monetary policy outlook. Across the yield curve, rates on nominal Treasury secu- rities ended the period significantly higher, primarily re- flecting the revision in the outlook for monetary policy and the associated rise in real yields. Market-based measures of inflation compensation continued to indi- cate expectations that inflation would decline notably in coming quarters, and measures of medium-term infla- tion compensation fell over the intermeeting period. Market participants reported that while liquidity condi- tions in the market for Treasury securities had been af- fected by the elevated volatility in rates and larger trades were having an increased effect on pricing, overall mar- ket functioning had held up. Responding to higher in- Page 2 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ terest rates and some concerns about the growth out- look, equity prices moved substantially lower over the period. The manager turned next to a discussion of develop- ments related to foreign central banks. Most major for- eign central banks were proceeding on a path of remov- ing policy accommodation in order to address elevated levels of inflation. Several—including those of Canada, Australia, and New Zealand—had raised their policy rates 50 basis points over the intermeeting period, and some signaled the potential need for more forceful tight- ening in order to address inflation risks. The European Central Bank (ECB) announced an end to its asset pur- chase program and signaled an intention to lift policy rates in July. Meanwhile, the stance of monetary policy in Japan was generally expected to remain highly accom- modative, though recent upward pressure on Japanese government bond yields had led the Bank of Japan (BOJ) to step up its efforts to defend its yield curve con- trol target. On balance, market participants were fo- cused on the largely synchronous shift toward monetary policy tightening across most advanced economies. Regarding money market developments, the manager noted that the 50 basis point increase in the target range at the May FOMC meeting passed through to the effec- tive federal funds rate and was also transmitted to other overnight rates. The federal funds rate held steady at 83 basis points throughout the period, while the Secured Overnight Financing Rate softened, on net, falling to the bottom of the federal funds target range later in the pe- riod. Contacts attributed the downward pressure on se- cured rates to high liquidity levels and declining Treasury bill supply, as well as elevated uncertainty about the in- terest rate path, which had increased demand for short- term investments. In this environment, participation in the overnight reverse repurchase agreement (ON RRP) facility increased, and a greater share of activity in over- night private repurchase agreement (repo) markets was conducted by lenders who lacked access to the facility. The manager noted that, if ON RRP usage continued to rise, it may be appropriate at some point to consider fur- ther lifting the per-counterparty limit. Over the longer term, ON RRP usage was expected to fall, with the re- duction in the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet resulting in a gradual rise in money market rates relative to the ON RRP rate. The deputy manager turned next to a discussion of Fed- eral Reserve operations and related topics. In accord- ance with the directive to the Open Market Desk, the reduction in SOMA securities holdings began in June, under the initial monthly caps on redemptions of $30 billion for Treasury securities and $17.5 billion for agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS). Under current staff projections, the SOMA portfolio was anticipated to decline roughly $400 billion by the end of 2022. As noted in the recent SOMA an- nual report and reported in the Board’s first-quarter fi- nancial statements for the Federal Reserve System, the SOMA portfolio had an unrealized loss, reflecting the increase in longer-term interest rates. Unrealized losses had no implications for Federal Reserve income and would eventually fall to zero as securities reached ma- turity. The staff projected that SOMA net income would decline and potentially turn negative, with increases in the target range lifting the interest expense on some lia- bilities, and that this eventuality could result in a deferred asset entry on the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet. Nei- ther unrealized losses on the Federal Reserve’s existing securities portfolio nor negative net income would im- pair the implementation of monetary policy or the Fed- eral Reserve’s ability to achieve its dual-mandate objec- tives. On other operational matters, the deputy manager noted that, over the intermeeting period, the Desk onboarded three depository institutions as new counterparties for the standing repo facility (SRF), resulting in a total of nine depository institutions approved, to date, as SRF counterparties. By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk’s domestic transactions over the intermeeting period. There were no intervention operations in foreign curren- cies for the System’s account during the intermeeting pe- riod. Staff Review of the Economic Situation The information available at the time of the June 14–15 meeting suggested that U.S. real gross domestic product (GDP) was rebounding to a moderate rate of increase in the second quarter after having declined in the first quar- ter. The labor market remained very tight, but there were some signs that momentum was slowing. Con- sumer price inflation—as measured by the 12‑month percentage change in the price index for personal con- sumption expenditures (PCE)—remained elevated in April, and available information suggested that inflation was still elevated in May. Total nonfarm payroll employment rose solidly in April and May, though the pace of increase was slower than in the first quarter, and the unemployment rate remained unchanged at 3.6 percent. The unemployment rates for African Americans and for Hispanics were little Minutes of the Meeting of June 14–15, 2022 Page 3 _____________________________________________________________________________________________ changed, on net, though both rates remained noticeably higher than the national average. On net, the labor force participation rate edged down between March and May, while the employment-to-population ratio was un- changed. The private-sector job openings rate, as meas- ured by the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, edged lower in April but remained at a high level. Nom- inal wage growth remained elevated, with average hourly earnings having risen 5.2 percent over the 12 months ending in May, and the increases were widespread across industries. Consumer price inflation remained elevated. Total PCE price inflation was 6.3 percent over the 12 months end- ing in April, and core PCE price inflation, which ex- cludes changes in consumer energy prices and many consumer food prices, was 4.9 percent over the same pe- riod. The trimmed mean measure of 12‑month PCE price inflation constructed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas was 3.8 percent in April, nearly 2 percentage points higher than its year-earlier rate of increase. In May, the 12-month change in the CPI was 8.6 percent, while core CPI inflation was 6.0 percent over the same period. Measures of inflation expectations derived from surveys of professional forecasters and of consumers generally suggested that inflation was expected to remain high in the short run but then fall back toward levels consistent with a longer-run rate of 2 percent. Production and spending indicators were mixed but gen- erally remained strong. Consumer spending and indus- trial production posted sizable gains in April. However, retail sales declined in May, data on home sales and sin- gle-family housing starts moved down in April, some in- dicators of manufacturing activity weakened in May, and the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers meas- ure of consumer sentiment decreased noticeably in the preliminary June reading. Supply disruptions appeared to have improved in some sectors (such as general mer- chandise retailers) but to have deteriorated in others (such as materials for home construction). On balance, the available indicators suggested that private domestic final purchases were increasing at a slower pace in the second quarter than in the first quarter. And with the available trade data for April pointing to a rebound in exports and a moderation in import growth in the sec- ond quarter, GDP growth appeared to be rebounding after having declined in the first quarter. Regarding trade, real imports of goods stepped back in April from their exceptional strength in March, driven by a decline in consumer goods imports. By contrast, real goods exports grew in both March and April after declining in the previous two months, following some normalization in categories such as soybeans and phar- maceuticals, which can exhibit large and idiosyncratic changes. Exports and imports of services continued to be held back by an incomplete recovery of international travel. The nominal U.S. international trade deficit wid- ened to a record size in March and then reversed that widening in April. Incoming data suggested that the global reverberations from lockdown measures to deal with the spread of the COVID-19 virus in China and the Russian invasion of Ukraine slowed foreign economic growth. In China, ac- tivity indicators pointed to a sizable restraint on eco- nomic activity. The Russian invasion of Ukraine contin- ued to have an imprint on foreign activity, with persis- tent stresses in global commodity markets and declining consumer and business confidence, especially in Europe. Inflation abroad moved higher, driven by further in- creases in consumer energy and food prices as well as some additional broadening of price pressures to core goods and services. Central banks around the world fur- ther tightened their monetary policy stances to curb high inflation. Staff Review of the Financial Situation Over the intermeeting period, U.S. Treasury yields and the market-implied federal funds rate path moved sub- stantially higher on net. Broad domestic equity price in- dexes declined considerably, on balance, amid elevated market volatility. In most advanced foreign economies (AFEs), sovereign yields also increased further, and for- eign equity price indexes moved lower. Despite further increases in borrowing costs, financing conditions in do- mestic credit markets remained generally accommoda- tive. The credit quality of firms, municipalities, and households remained largely stable, although the out- look for credit quality had begun to deteriorate some- what. Since the previous FOMC meeting, 2-, 5-, and 10-year nominal Treasury yields increased considerably on net. Early in the intermeeting period, Treasury yields moved lower amid rising concerns about a weakening U.S. growth outlook and Federal Reserve communications perceived as lowering the chances of large policy rate hikes at upcoming meetings. However, yields increased late in the period, with economic data releases largely be- ing interpreted as highlighting the possibility of a more aggressive tightening of monetary policy. The expected federal funds rate path—implied by a straight read of overnight index swap quotes—also increased notably on balance. Real yields increased more than their nominal Page 4 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ counterparts, while inflation compensation implied by Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities declined. Broad equity price indexes fell sharply over the inter- meeting period on net. The stock price declines were largely associated with mixed corporate earnings news early in the period and increasing concerns about the economic outlook amid global policy tightening. One- month option-implied volatility on the S&P 500 index— the VIX—increased moderately, on balance, remaining elevated relative to its historical distribution and signifi- cantly above average pre-pandemic levels. Spreads on investment-grade and, to a greater extent, speculative- grade corporate bonds widened notably, on net, reach- ing levels comparable with those at the end of 2018. This widening of spreads was associated with increased concerns about the outlook for corporate credit amid monetary policy tightening. Since the previous FOMC meeting, spreads on municipal bonds narrowed substan- tially, on net, moving near levels observed for several years before the pandemic, as investor demand exhibited some recovery over much of the period from earlier weak levels. Conditions in short-term funding markets remained sta- ble over the intermeeting period, with the May increase in the Federal Reserve’s administered rates passing through promptly to overnight money market rates. Spreads on longer-tenor commercial paper (CP) and ne- gotiable certificates of deposit narrowed moderately, with no signs of spillovers beyond the stablecoin market following the collapse of a large algorithmic stablecoin. Indeed, CP outstanding increased slightly over the pe- riod. Money market fund (MMF) net yields across all fund types rose notably, as increases in administered rates passed through to money market instruments. Se- cured overnight rates softened significantly relative to the ON RRP offering rate since the May FOMC meet- ing, with the downward pressure on rates attributed to continuing declines in net Treasury bill issuance, ele- vated demand for collateral in the form of Treasury se- curities, and MMFs maintaining very short portfolio ma- turities amid uncertainty about the pace of anticipated policy rate increases. Consistent with the downward pressure on repo rates, daily take-up in the ON RRP fa- cility increased further. Sovereign yields in most AFEs rose over the intermeet- ing period amid investors’ concerns about further infla- tionary pressures and major central banks’ policy com- munications suggesting a firmer stance of policy. Inter- est rate volatility in AFEs increased, consistent with in- creased uncertainty about the path of policy rates. Con- cerns about the global growth outlook weighed on eq- uity prices, and the broad dollar edged up. Implied eq- uity price volatility remained at elevated levels. Japanese yields and equity prices, however, ended the period about unchanged, as the BOJ reaffirmed its accommo- dative monetary policy stance. Sovereign bond spreads over German bund yields for euro-area peripheral coun- tries widened further. These moves were partially re- traced following an unscheduled meeting of the ECB on June 15, at which the ECB indicated that it would take action to address potential fragmentation risk in euro- area sovereign bond markets. Outflows from emerging market-dedicated funds intensified in early May, espe- cially from local currency bond funds, and credit spreads in emerging market economies widened moderately. In domestic credit markets, financing conditions for most businesses and households remained generally ac- commodative over the intermeeting period. Credit re- mained widely available, particularly to higher-rated firms and consumers with higher credit scores. Gross nonfinancial corporate bond issuance slowed in May, es- pecially among speculative-grade issuers, amid elevated market volatility and high yields. Gross institutional lev- eraged loan issuance decelerated and initial public offer- ing volumes remained extremely slow in May, while gross issuance of municipal bonds remained robust. Commercial and industrial (C&I) and commercial real estate (CRE) loans on banks’ balance sheets expanded at a rapid pace in April and May. Issuance of both agency and non-agency commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) stepped down slightly in May from its strong pace earlier in the year. Small business loan originations through April were in line with pre-pandemic levels and indicated that credit appeared to be available. Residential mortgage credit remained widely available through May for most borrowers. While refinance vol- umes continued trending lower in April and May amid higher mortgage rates, outstanding balances of home eq- uity lines of credit at commercial banks posted the first significant increase in more than a decade, likely reflect- ing a substitution by homeowners away from cash-out refinances. In consumer credit markets, auto loans out- standing grew at a robust pace in the first quarter, con- sistent with a rebound in auto sales, but slowed in April and May. Credit card balances at commercial banks rose in April at the fastest pace seen in recent decades, but growth slowed in May. Minutes of the Meeting of June 14–15, 2022 Page 5 _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Borrowing costs had continued to increase in many sec- tors since the previous FOMC meeting. Yields on non- financial corporate bonds remained well above pre- pandemic levels, and new issuance spreads for institu- tional leveraged loans ticked up in May. Bank interest rates for both C&I and CRE loans also increased. Among small businesses that borrow on a regular basis, the share facing higher borrowing costs rose in both April and May. Borrowing costs for residential mortgage loans increased significantly over the intermeeting pe- riod, in line with the increases in MBS and Treasury yields, reaching their highest levels since 2010. In con- sumer credit markets, rates on auto loans and new credit card offers continued to trend upward. Despite the historically low volumes of defaults on both corporate bonds and leveraged loans in April, in the later weeks of the intermeeting period the volume of credit rating downgrades of leveraged loans exceeded the vol- ume of upgrades. In addition, market indicators of fu- ture default expectations of businesses deteriorated to some extent, as investors appeared to mark down their assessment of the macroeconomic outlook. Credit quality of business loans on banks’ books re- mained sound, with C&I and CRE delinquency rates continuing to be low through March. Nonetheless, banks allocated net positive loan loss provisions in the first quarter of this year. This development reversed a pattern of loan loss reserves being released throughout last year and reflected concerns about the credit quality outlook. Delinquency rates on CMBS and small busi- ness loans continued to decline, and the credit quality of municipal securities remained strong. Household credit quality remained solid, with the share of consumers with subprime credit scores still near his- torical lows. In addition, mortgage delinquencies and the share of mortgages in forbearance both continued to trend down in recent months. While nonprime auto loan delinquency rates edged down a touch in the first quarter, credit card delinquency rates for account hold- ers with below-prime credit scores inched up from low levels. The sizable increases in credit card purchase vol- umes through March were roughly offset by high levels of credit card payments, thus increasing household bor- rowing only slightly. Staff Economic Outlook The projection for U.S. economic activity prepared by the staff for the June FOMC meeting implied a trajectory for real GDP that was lower than in the May projection. The staff continued to project that GDP growth would rebound in the second quarter and remain solid over the remainder of the year. However, monetary policy was assumed to be less accommodative than in the previous projection, and the recent and prospective tightening of financial conditions led the staff to reduce its GDP growth forecast for the second half of 2022 and for 2023. The level of real GDP was still expected to remain well above potential over the projection period, though the gap was projected to narrow significantly this year and to narrow a little further next year. Labor market conditions also were expected to remain very tight, albeit somewhat less so than in the previous projection. With regard to PCE price inflation, the staff revised up its projection for the second half of 2022 in response to stronger-than-expected wage growth and the staff’s as- sessment that the boost to inflation from supply– demand imbalances in the economy, including in food and energy markets, would be more persistent than pre- viously assumed. All told, total PCE price inflation was expected to be 5.0 percent in 2022, while core inflation was expected to be 4.1 percent. PCE price inflation was then expected to step down to 2.4 percent in 2023 and to 2.0 percent in 2024, as energy prices were forecast to decline and as supply–demand imbalances were pro- jected to diminish because of slowing aggregate demand and an easing of supply constraints. Similarly, core in- flation was projected to slow to 2.6 percent in 2023 and to 2.2 percent in 2024. The staff continued to judge that the risks to the baseline projection for real activity were skewed to the downside and that the risks to the inflation projection were skewed to the upside. The staff judged that the ongoing war in Ukraine remained a possible source of even greater up- ward pressure on energy and commodity prices, while the war and adverse developments associated with China’s zero-COVID policy were both perceived as in- creasing the risk that supply chain disruptions and pro- duction constraints would be further exacerbated in the United States and abroad. Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, participants submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and infla- tion for each year from 2022 through 2024 and over the longer run based on their individual assessments of ap- propriate monetary policy, including the path of the fed- eral funds rate. The longer-run projections represented each participant’s assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, un- der appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of Page 6 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ further shocks to the economy. A Summary of Eco- nomic Projections (SEP) was released to the public fol- lowing the conclusion of the meeting. In their discussion of current economic conditions, par- ticipants noted that overall economic activity appeared to have picked up after edging down in the first quarter. Job gains had been robust in recent months, and the un- employment rate had remained low. Inflation remained elevated, reflecting supply and demand imbalances re- lated to the pandemic, higher energy prices, and broader price pressures. Participants recognized that the inva- sion of Ukraine by Russia was causing tremendous hu- man and economic hardship for the Ukrainian people. Participants judged that the invasion and related events were creating additional upward pressure on inflation and were weighing on global economic activity. In ad- dition, participants indicated that COVID-related lock- downs in China were likely to exacerbate supply chain disruptions. Against this background, participants stated that they were highly attentive to inflation risks. With regard to the economic outlook, participants noted that recent indicators suggested that real GDP growth was expanding in the current quarter, with consumption spending remaining strong. Participants generally judged that growth in business fixed investment ap- peared to be slowing, and activity in the housing sector appeared to be softening, in part as a result of a sharp rise in mortgage rates. Correspondingly, participants in- dicated that they had revised down their projections of real GDP growth for this year, consistent with ongoing supply chain disruptions and tighter financial conditions. Participants noted that the imbalance between supply and demand across a wide range of product markets was contributing to upward pressure on inflation. They saw an appropriate firming of monetary policy and associ- ated tighter financial conditions as playing a central role in helping address this imbalance and in supporting the Federal Reserve’s goals of maximum employment and price stability. An easing of supply bottlenecks, a further rise in labor force participation, and the waning effects of pandemic-related fiscal policy support were cited as additional factors that could help reduce the supply– demand imbalances in the economy and therefore lower inflation over the next few years. That said, the timing and magnitude of these effects were uncertain. Partici- pants saw little evidence to date of a substantial improve- ment in supply constraints, and some of them judged that the economic effects of these constraints were likely to persist longer than they had previously anticipated. Participants stressed the need to adjust the stance of pol- icy in response to incoming information regarding the evolution of these and other factors. In their discussion of the household sector, participants indicated that consumption spending had remained ro- bust, in part reflecting strong balance sheets in the household sector and a tight labor market. Several par- ticipants noted that household spending patterns ap- peared to be shifting away from goods to services. Sev- eral participants indicated that some of their contacts re- ported that the pace of consumer spending, though strong, was beginning to moderate. One reason cited for this moderation was that the purchasing power of households was being reduced by higher prices for food, energy, and other essentials. Participants generally ex- pected higher mortgage interest rates to contribute to further declines in home sales, and a couple of partici- pants noted that housing activity in their Districts had begun to slow noticeably. Against the backdrop of rising borrowing costs and higher gasoline and food prices, a couple of participants commented that consumer senti- ment had dropped notably in June, according to the pre- liminary reading in the Michigan survey. With respect to the business sector, participants ob- served that their contacts generally reported that sales remained strong, although some contacts indicated that sales had begun to slow and that they had become less optimistic about the outlook. In many industries, the ability of firms to meet demand continued to be limited by labor shortages and supply chain bottlenecks. Firms relying on international sources for their inputs were seen as encountering particularly acute supply chain dis- ruptions. Supply constraints, labor shortages, and rising input costs were also reportedly limiting energy and ag- ricultural producers’ ability to take advantage of the higher prices of their products by investing and expand- ing their production capacity. Similarly, a few partici- pants noted that, in other sectors of the economy, their contacts reported that they were postponing investment or construction projects because of rising input and fi- nancing costs. With supply challenges still widespread, contacts continued to assess that supply constraints overall were significant, and many of them judged that these constraints were likely to persist for some time. Participants noted that the demand for labor continued to outstrip available supply across many parts of the economy. They observed that various indicators pointed to a very tight labor market. These indicators included an unemployment rate near a 50-year low, job vacancies at historical highs, and elevated nominal wage Minutes of the Meeting of June 14–15, 2022 Page 7 _____________________________________________________________________________________________ growth. Additionally, most business contacts had con- tinued to report persistent wage pressures as well as dif- ficulties in hiring and retaining workers. However, some contacts reported that, because of previous wage hikes, hiring and retention had improved and pressure for ad- ditional wage increases appeared to be receding. Employment growth, while moderating somewhat from its pace earlier in the year, had remained robust. Several participants observed that labor force participation re- mained below its pre-pandemic level because of the un- usually large number of retirements during the pandemic and judged that the labor force participation rate was un- likely to move up considerably in the near term. A cou- ple of participants raised the possibility that tight labor markets would spur investment in automation by firms, boosting labor productivity. While labor markets were anticipated to remain tight in the near term, participants expected labor demand and supply to come into better balance over time, helping to ease upward pressure on wages and prices. As in the case of product markets, they anticipated that an appro- priate firming of monetary policy would play a central role in helping address imbalances in the labor market. With the tightness in labor markets anticipated to dimin- ish over time, participants generally expected the unem- ployment rate to increase, as the median projection of the unemployment rate in the June SEP showed a grad- ual rise over the next few years, reaching 4.1 percent in 2024. In light of the very high level of job vacancies, a number of participants judged that the expected moder- ation in labor demand relative to supply might primarily affect vacancies and have a less significant effect on the unemployment rate. Participants noted that inflation remained much too high and observed that it continued to run well above the Committee’s longer-run 2 percent objective, with to- tal PCE prices having risen 6.3 percent over the 12 months ending in April. They also observed that the 12-month change in the CPI in May came in above ex- pectations. Participants were concerned that the May CPI release indicated that inflation pressures had yet to show signs of abating, and a number of them saw it as solidifying the view that inflation would be more persis- tent than they had previously anticipated. They com- mented on the hardship caused by elevated inflation, with low- and moderate-income households especially affected. These households had to spend more of their budgets on essentials such as food, energy, and housing and were less able to bear the rapidly rising costs of these essentials. In that context, some participants noted that their contacts had reported that low- and moderate- income consumers were shifting purchases to lower-cost goods. Participants also stressed that persistently high inflation would impede the achievement of maximum employment on a sustained basis. Participants judged that strong aggregate demand, to- gether with supply constraints that had been larger and longer lasting than expected, continued to contribute to price pressures across a broad array of goods and ser- vices. They noted that the surge in prices of oil and other commodities associated with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine was boosting gasoline and food prices and put- ting additional upward pressure on inflation. Partici- pants commented on the global nature of inflation pres- sures, and a few of them added that many foreign central banks were also firming the stance of monetary policy. Several participants judged that a shift in spending from goods to services was likely to be associated with less upward pressure on prices in the goods sector, but also an intensification of upward pressure on prices in the services sector. Participants had revised up their PCE inflation projections for 2022 in their June SEP submis- sions, largely in response to higher-than-expected infla- tion readings and the slower anticipated resolution of supply constraints. They expected that the appropriate firming of monetary policy and an eventual easing of supply and demand imbalances would bring inflation back down to levels roughly consistent with the Com- mittee’s longer-run objectives by 2024 and keep longer- term inflation expectations well anchored. Participants observed that some measures of inflation expectations had moved up recently, including the staff index of common inflation expectations and the expec- tations of inflation over the next 5 to 10 years provided in the Michigan survey. With respect to market-based measures, however, a few participants noted that me- dium-term measures of inflation compensation fell over the intermeeting period and longer-term measures were unchanged. While measures of longer-term inflation ex- pectations derived from surveys of households, profes- sional forecasters, and market participants were gener- ally judged to be broadly consistent with the Commit- tee’s longer-run 2 percent inflation objective, many par- ticipants raised the concern that longer-run inflation ex- pectations could be beginning to drift up to levels incon- sistent with the 2 percent objective. These participants noted that, if inflation expectations were to become unanchored, it would be more costly to bring inflation back down to the Committee’s objective. Page 8 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ In their discussion of risks, participants emphasized that they were highly attentive to inflation risks and were closely monitoring developments regarding both infla- tion and inflation expectations. Most agreed that risks to inflation were skewed to the upside and cited several such risks, including those associated with ongoing sup- ply bottlenecks and rising energy and commodity prices. Participants judged that uncertainty about economic growth over the next couple of years was elevated. In that context, a couple of them noted that GDP and gross domestic income had been giving conflicting signals re- cently regarding the pace of economic growth, making it challenging to determine the economy’s underlying mo- mentum. Most participants assessed that the risks to the outlook for economic growth were skewed to the down- side. Downside risks included the possibility that a fur- ther tightening in financial conditions would have a larger negative effect on economic activity than antici- pated as well as the possibilities that the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the COVID-related lockdowns in China would have larger-than-expected effects on economic growth. In their consideration of the appropriate stance of mon- etary policy, participants concurred that the labor market was very tight, inflation was well above the Committee’s 2 percent inflation objective, and the near-term inflation outlook had deteriorated since the time of the May meet- ing. Against this backdrop, almost all participants agreed that it was appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate 75 basis points at this meeting. One participant favored a 50 basis point increase in the target range at this meeting instead of 75 basis points. All par- ticipants judged that it was appropriate to continue the process of reducing the size of the Federal Reserve’s bal- ance sheet, as described in the Plans for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve’s Balance Sheet that the Committee issued in May. In light of elevated inflation pressures and signs of deterioration in some measures of inflation expectations, all participants reaffirmed their strong commitment to returning inflation to the Com- mittee’s 2 percent objective. Participants observed that a return of inflation to the 2 percent objective was nec- essary for creating conditions conducive to a sustainably strong labor market over time. In discussing potential policy actions at upcoming meet- ings, participants continued to anticipate that ongoing increases in the target range for the federal funds rate would be appropriate to achieve the Committee’s objec- tives. In particular, participants judged that an increase of 50 or 75 basis points would likely be appropriate at the next meeting. Participants concurred that the eco- nomic outlook warranted moving to a restrictive stance of policy, and they recognized the possibility that an even more restrictive stance could be appropriate if ele- vated inflation pressures were to persist. Participants noted that, with the federal funds rate ex- pected to be near or above estimates of its longer-run level later this year, the Committee would then be well positioned to determine the appropriate pace of further policy firming and the extent to which economic devel- opments warranted policy adjustments. They also re- marked that the pace of rate increases and the extent of future policy tightening would depend on the incoming data and the evolving outlook for the economy. Many participants noted that the Committee’s credibility with regard to bringing inflation back to the 2 percent objec- tive, together with previous communications, had been helpful in shifting market expectations of future policy and had already contributed to a notable tightening of financial conditions that would likely help reduce infla- tion pressures by restraining aggregate demand. Partici- pants recognized that ongoing policy firming would be appropriate if economic conditions evolved as expected. At the current juncture, with inflation remaining well above the Committee’s objective, participants remarked that moving to a restrictive stance of policy was required to meet the Committee’s legislative mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability. In addition, such a stance would be appropriate from a risk manage- ment perspective because it would put the Committee in a better position to implement more restrictive policy if inflation came in higher than expected. Many partici- pants judged that a significant risk now facing the Com- mittee was that elevated inflation could become en- trenched if the public began to question the resolve of the Committee to adjust the stance of policy as war- ranted. On this matter, participants stressed that appro- priate firming of monetary policy, together with clear and effective communications, would be essential in re- storing price stability. Participants remarked that developments associated with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the COVID-related lockdowns in China, and other factors restraining supply conditions would affect the inflation outlook and that it would likely take some time for inflation to move down to the Committee’s 2 percent objective. Participants also judged that maintaining a strong labor market during the process of bringing inflation down to 2 percent would depend on many factors affecting demand and supply. Participants recognized that policy firming could slow Minutes of the Meeting of June 14–15, 2022 Page 9 _____________________________________________________________________________________________ the pace of economic growth for a time, but they saw the return of inflation to 2 percent as critical to achieving maximum employment on a sustained basis. Committee Policy Action In their discussion of monetary policy for this meeting, members agreed that overall economic activity appeared to have picked up after edging down in the first quarter. Job gains had been robust in recent months, and the un- employment rate had remained low. Members also agreed that inflation remained elevated, reflecting supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic, higher energy prices, and broader price pressures. Members concurred that the invasion of Ukraine by Russia was causing tremendous human and economic hardship. Members agreed that the invasion and related events were creating additional upward pressure on in- flation and were weighing on global economic activity. With the effects of the invasion of Ukraine by Russia already materializing, members considered it appropriate to omit from the June statement the sentence conveying the high uncertainty associated with the implications of the invasion for the U.S. economy. Members also agreed that COVID-related lockdowns in China were likely to exacerbate supply chain disruptions. In light of these developments, members remarked that they remain highly attentive to the upside risks to inflation and would be nimble in responding to incoming data and the evolv- ing outlook. In their assessment of the monetary policy stance neces- sary for achieving the Committee’s maximum-employ- ment and price-stability goals, the Committee decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 1½ to 1¾ percent and anticipated that ongoing increases in the target range would be appropriate. In addition, mem- bers agreed that the Committee would continue reduc- ing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency MBS, as described in the Plans for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve’s Balance Sheet that were issued in May. One member preferred to raise the target range for the federal funds rate 50 basis points to 1¼ to 1½ percent at this meeting. Members judged that, with high and widespread infla- tion pressures and some measures of longer-term infla- tion expectations moving up somewhat, it would be ap- propriate for the postmeeting statement to note that the Committee was strongly committed to returning infla- tion to its 2 percent objective. As the further firming in the policy stance would likely result in some slowing in economic growth and tempering in labor market condi- tions, members also agreed to remove the previous state- ment language that had indicated an expectation that ap- propriate policy would result in a return of inflation to 2 percent and a strong labor market. Members agreed that, in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, they would continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and that they would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate in the event that risks emerged that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals. They also concurred that their assessments would take into account a wide range of in- formation, including readings on public health, labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation ex- pectations, and financial and international develop- ments. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the fol- lowing domestic policy directive, for release at 2:00 p.m.: “Effective June 16, 2022, the Federal Open Market Committee directs the Desk to:  Undertake open market operations as nec- essary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of 1½ to 1¾ percent.  Conduct overnight repurchase agreement operations with a minimum bid rate of 1.75 percent and with an aggregate opera- tion limit of $500 billion; the aggregate op- eration limit can be temporarily increased at the discretion of the Chair.  Conduct overnight reverse repurchase agreement operations at an offering rate of 1.55 percent and with a per-counterparty limit of $160 billion per day; the per-counterparty limit can be temporarily increased at the discretion of the Chair.  Roll over at auction the amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s hold- ings of Treasury securities maturing in the calendar months of June and July that ex- ceeds a cap of $30 billion per month. Re- deem Treasury coupon securities up to this monthly cap and Treasury bills to the extent that coupon principal payments are less than the monthly cap. Page 10 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________  Reinvest into agency mortgage-backed se- curities (MBS) the amount of principal pay- ments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of agency debt and agency MBS received in the calendar months of June and July that exceeds a cap of $17.5 billion per month.  Allow modest deviations from stated amounts for reinvestments, if needed for operational reasons.  Engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settle- ment of the Federal Reserve’s agency MBS transactions.” The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below for release at 2:00 p.m.: “Overall economic activity appears to have picked up after edging down in the first quarter. Job gains have been robust in recent months, and the unemployment rate has remained low. Inflation remains elevated, reflecting supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic, higher energy prices, and broader price pres- sures. The invasion of Ukraine by Russia is causing tremendous human and economic hardship. The invasion and related events are creating ad- ditional upward pressure on inflation and are weighing on global economic activity. In addi- tion, COVID-related lockdowns in China are likely to exacerbate supply chain disruptions. The Committee is highly attentive to inflation risks. The Committee seeks to achieve maximum em- ployment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. In support of these goals, the Committee decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 1½ to 1¾ percent and anticipates that ongoing increases in the tar- get range will be appropriate. In addition, the Committee will continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and 5 In taking this action, the Board approved a request to estab- lish that rate submitted by the Board of Directors of the Fed- eral Reserve Bank of Minneapolis. This vote also encom- passed approval by the Board of Governors of the establish- ment of a 1.75 percent primary credit rate by the remaining Federal Reserve Banks, effective on the later of June 16, 2022, or the date such Reserve Banks inform the Secretary of the agency mortgage-backed securities, as described in the Plans for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve’s Balance Sheet that were issued in May. The Committee is strongly committed to returning inflation to its 2 percent objective. In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals. The Committee’s assessments will take into account a wide range of information, in- cluding readings on public health, labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation ex- pectations, and financial and international de- velopments.” Voting for this action: Jerome H. Powell, John C. Williams, Michelle W. Bowman, Lael Brainard, James Bullard, Lisa D. Cook, Patrick Harker, Philip N. Jefferson, Loretta J. Mester, and Christopher J. Waller. Voting against this action: Esther L. George. Patrick Harker voted as an alternate member at this meeting. President George dissented because she judged that a large increase in the target range for the federal funds rate would add to uncertainty about policy concurrent with the beginning of balance sheet runoff in ways that could unsettle households and businesses and could also adversely affect the ability of small banks to meet the credit needs of their communities. To support the Committee’s decision to raise the target range for the federal funds rate, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted unanimously to raise the interest rate paid on reserve balances to 1.65 percent, effective June 16, 2022.

Financial markets over the intermeeting period reflected elevated uncertainty about the outlook. Most market participants appeared to view a moderation of inflation and slower, but still positive, economic growth ahead as the most likely sce- nario. However, investors appeared to be increasingly attentive to downside risks to the economy in light of the potential for shocks from abroad and the continued upside surprises to inflation. On net, financial conditions eased modestly over the pe- riod but remained substantially tighter than at the start of the year. Treasury yields fell, reflecting expectations of slower growth as well as a decline in inflation com- pensation. Respondents to the Open Market Desk’s sur- veys of primary dealers and market participants marked down their growth forecasts for 2022 and 2023 and at- tached higher odds than in the June survey to the possi- bility that the U.S. economy could enter a recession in coming quarters. Market participants perceived falling commodity prices—particularly for oil—and the FOMC’s commit- ment to bringing inflation down as pointing to lower in- flation ahead. Market-based measures of near-dated in- flation compensation declined and continued to suggest that inflation would ease in coming quarters. In the Desk surveys, respondents also expected inflation to de- cline substantially in 2023 but assigned meaningful prob- abilities to a wide range of potential outcomes, including scenarios involving continued elevated rates of inflation. Far-forward market-based measures of inflation com- 5 Attended from the discussion of the economic and financial situation through the end of Wednesday’s session. Page 2 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ pensation fell over the period. These measures contin- ued to suggest that inflation would return over time to the Committee’s 2 percent objective. In their assessment of the policy outlook, market partic- ipants expected significant policy tightening in coming meetings as the Committee continued to respond to the current elevated level of inflation. Nearly all respond- ents to the Desk survey anticipated a 75 basis point in- crease in the target range at the current meeting, and most expected a 50 basis point increase in September to follow. The market-implied path of the federal funds rate indicated a peak policy rate of around 3.4 percent, significantly lower than at the time of the June meeting. The market-implied path suggested expectations that the policy rate would fall thereafter. Most respondents to the Desk survey expected the federal funds rate to re- main above the survey’s longer-run policy rate of 2.4 percent through the end of 2024, but, on average, re- spondents placed significant probabilities on lower rate outcomes. Regarding developments abroad, central banks in ad- vanced foreign economies (AFEs) had quickened the pace of policy tightening in order to address above-tar- get inflation. Eight advanced-economy central banks raised their policy rates over the period. Along lines sim- ilar to U.S. developments, market-implied policy rates in most AFEs fell at longer horizons and reflected expec- tations that policy rates would reach peak levels by early 2023. In contrast to central banks in other advanced economies, the Bank of Japan confirmed its commit- ment to accommodative policy. In this environment, the exchange value of the dollar appreciated further, surpas- sing its March 2020 peak against advanced-economy currencies. The deputy manager next turned to a discussion of money markets and Desk operations. The 75 basis point increase in the target range at the June meeting passed through fully to the federal funds rate and other over- night rates. Although downward pressure on overnight secured rates had persisted, the pronounced softness ob- served in the past intermeeting period had abated to some degree. The overnight reverse repurchase agree- ment (ON RRP) facility continued to support policy im- plementation, and balances remained elevated. The dep- uty manager anticipated that, in the near term, the evo- lution of take-up at the ON RRP facility would continue to depend on changes in the supply of safe, short-term investments, and the demand for such investments by money market mutual funds (MMMFs). ON RRP bal- ances were expected to decline over time as balance sheet runoff proceeded. The deputy manager noted that this process would involve adjustments across a number of markets and that the staff would continue to monitor developments in money markets closely. Regarding expectations for the evolution of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet, market participants expected the Committee to increase the monthly caps on System Open Market Account (SOMA) redemptions beginning in September, as announced in the Plans for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve’s Balance Sheet issued in May. Treasury coupon principal payments would first fall below the $60 billion cap in September, with the re- mainder of redemptions met with maturities of Treasury bills. Paydowns of agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) were projected to fall below the higher Septem- ber cap of $35 billion beginning in September. The deputy manager ended with an update on SOMA net income. Staff projections suggested that net income would likely turn negative in coming months. That de- velopment would be reflected in a temporary deferred asset on Reserve Bank balance sheets. Any deferred as- set would not affect the Committee’s ability to imple- ment monetary policy, and the deferred asset would be extinguished over time as net income turned positive again in later years. By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk’s domestic transactions over the intermeeting period. There were no intervention operations in foreign curren- cies for the System’s account during the intermeeting pe- riod. Staff Review of the Economic Situation The information available at the time of the July 26–27 meeting suggested that U.S. real gross domestic product (GDP) had declined over the first half of the year. How- ever, the labor market continued to be very tight, and labor demand remained strong. Consumer price infla- tion—as measured by the 12-month percentage change in the price index for personal consumption expendi- tures (PCE)—remained elevated in May, and available information suggested that inflation was still elevated in June. Total nonfarm payroll employment posted a solid gain in June at a pace that was similar to that seen in April and May. The unemployment rate was unchanged in June at 3.6 percent. The unemployment rate for African Americans moved lower in June, while the rate for His- panics was unchanged; both rates were noticeably higher than the national average. The labor force participation rate and the employment-to-population ratio both ticked _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Minutes of the Meeting of July 26–27, 2022 Page 3 down in June. The private-sector job openings rate, as measured by the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Sur- vey, declined further in May but remained at a high level. Nominal wage growth continued to be rapid and broad based, with average hourly earnings having risen 5.1 per- cent over the 12 months ending in June. Real goods exports edged down in May after growing robustly in March and April. Real goods imports con- tinued to step down from the exceptionally strong March readings, driven by declines in imports of con- sumer goods and capital goods. Exports and imports of services continued to be held back by an incomplete re- covery of international travel. The nominal U.S. inter- national trade deficit narrowed for a second consecutive month in May from its record size in March. The avail- able data suggest that net exports contributed positively to GDP growth in the second quarter. Consumer price inflation remained elevated. Total PCE price inflation was 6.3 percent over the 12 months end- ing in May, and core PCE price inflation, which excludes changes in consumer energy prices and many consumer food prices, was 4.7 percent over the same period. The trimmed mean measure of 12-month PCE price infla- tion constructed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas was 4.0 percent in May, 2.1 percentage points higher than its year-earlier rate of increase. In June, the 12-month change in the consumer price index (CPI) was 9.1 percent, while core CPI inflation was 5.9 percent over the same period. Survey-based measures of short- run inflation expectations remained elevated; by con- trast, some measures of longer-term inflation expecta- tions moved lower in recent weeks. Available indicators suggested that real PCE rose at a modest pace in the second quarter, while business in- vestment, residential investment, and government pur- chases all posted declines. Manufacturing output moved lower in May and June, and forward-looking indicators of manufacturing activity weakened broadly. Foreign economic growth slowed notably in the second quarter, as COVID-19-related lockdowns led to a sharp contraction in China and Russia’s war against Ukraine took a toll on foreign activity, especially in Europe. In- dicators for June showed the Chinese economy re- bounding as the lockdowns were eased. The global economy, however, continued to face headwinds from disruptions to the supply of energy, elevated political un- certainties in Europe, and tighter global monetary and financial conditions. Although most commodity prices moved lower from elevated levels in recent weeks, for- eign consumer price inflation continued to rise through June, mostly reflecting past increases in energy and food prices, but also a continued broadening of price pres- sures to core goods and services. Many foreign central banks tightened monetary policy to address high infla- tion. Staff Review of the Financial Situation Over the intermeeting period, nominal and real Treasury yields declined significantly, reportedly reflecting in- creased investor concerns about downside risks to the growth outlook as well as a decline in inflation compen- sation. Sovereign yields in AFEs declined notably. The market-implied federal funds rate path for the next few meetings rose but moved down noticeably at longer ho- rizons. Broad equity price indexes were higher, on net, while credit spreads widened. Major foreign equity price indexes edged higher, on net, and the exchange value of the dollar continued to appreciate. Amid the decline in Treasury yields, longer-term borrowing costs declined for households and businesses with higher credit ratings, and while credit availability remained generally available, it appeared to tighten for most businesses and some households. Broad equity price indexes were higher over the inter- meeting period, amid heightened volatility. Declines in interest rates likely supported stock prices over the pe- riod, while some positive earnings releases suggested to investors a less pessimistic corporate outlook. One- month option-implied volatility on the S&P 500 index— the VIX—decreased but remained significantly above its pre-pandemic levels. Yields on corporate bonds de- clined notably across the credit spectrum, but corporate bond spreads ended the period slightly wider. Spreads on municipal bonds widened slightly as yields declined by less than those of comparable-maturity Treasury se- curities. Conditions in short-term funding markets were stable since the previous FOMC meeting, with the June in- crease in the Federal Reserve’s administered rates pass- ing through promptly to overnight money markets. Se- cured overnight rates remained soft relative to the ON RRP offering rate, with the downward pressure on rates attributed to continuing declines in net Treasury bill is- suance, elevated demand for collateral in the form of Treasury securities, and MMMFs maintaining very short portfolio maturities amid uncertainty about the near- term outlook for policy rate increases. Consistent with the downward pressure on repo rates, daily take-up in the ON RRP facility increased. Spreads on lower-rated short-term commercial paper (CP) narrowed modestly, on net. Bank core deposit rates moved up very little in Page 4 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ response to the Federal Reserve’s increase in adminis- tered rates following the June FOMC meeting, while MMMFs’ net yields rose, reflecting the increases in short-term rates over recent months. Investors’ concerns about global economic growth in- tensified amid weaker-than-expected data on economic activity and uncertainty about the supply of natural gas from Russia to Europe. Sovereign yields and medium- term inflation compensation measures in major AFEs, most notably in the euro area, moved down, with yields largely reversing the sharp increase that occurred just be- fore the June FOMC meeting. In the euro area, periph- eral sovereign spreads were little changed following the widely anticipated announcement by the European Cen- tral Bank of its Transmission Protection Instrument that could be activated to counter disorderly conditions in euro-area bond markets. Major foreign equity price in- dexes were volatile but generally edged higher, on net, supported by declines in sovereign yields. The dollar ap- preciated somewhat further against most currencies and particularly against the euro as yield differentials between the United States and the euro area widened. Most Latin American currencies depreciated against the dollar, in part reflecting the decline in global commodity prices. In domestic credit markets, longer-term borrowing costs for households and businesses with higher credit ratings declined over the intermeeting period but borrowing costs for lower rated firms were higher, on net. The credit quality of businesses, municipalities, and house- holds remained stable. Credit remained generally avail- able, though credit availability appeared to tighten for most businesses and for some households. Borrowing costs linked to shorter-term interest rates generally increased, largely as a result of expectations of tighter monetary policy. Bank interest rates for both commercial and industrial (C&I) and commercial real es- tate (CRE) loans increased in May and were close to pre- pandemic levels. Yields on institutional leveraged loans and newly issued commercial mortgage-backed securi- ties (CMBS) increased amid financial market volatility and growing concerns about an economic slowdown. Small businesses that borrow on a regular basis faced notably higher borrowing costs in June. Interest rates on most existing credit card accounts and on auto loans continued to trend upward. In contrast to many other borrowing rates, residential mortgage rates fell since the June FOMC meeting, in line with the drop in longer- term yields, but remained near their highest levels since 2010. The credit quality of nonfinancial corporations remained strong with low volumes of defaults on corporate bonds in May and on leveraged loans in June. The volume of rating downgrades on speculative-grade credit in the cor- porate bond market was similar to that of upgrades in June, while for leveraged loans, the volume of down- grades exceeded the volume of upgrades in May and June. The credit quality for C&I and CRE loans on banks’ books remained sound. However, respondents in the July Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices (SLOOS) indicated increased con- cerns about credit quality in the near future as reasons for their expectation of a tightening in lending standards over the second half of 2022. Delinquency rates on CRE loans in CMBS declined in June, delinquency rates on small business loans were little changed, and the credit quality of municipal securities remained strong. The credit quality of households stayed solid. Residential mortgage delinquencies and the share of mortgages in forbearance trended down. Credit card and auto credit delinquency rates rose somewhat over the first quarter but remained subdued by recent historical standards. Business loans at banks expanded at a rapid pace in May and June, despite higher interest rates and a more uncer- tain economic outlook. C&I loans on banks’ books con- tinued to grow robustly, with the July SLOOS citing rea- sons of increased demand by customers to finance in- ventory and accounts receivable. However, issuance of both agency and non-agency CMBS slowed significantly in June. Credit appeared to be available to most small businesses, although the share of small firms reporting that it was difficult to obtain loans increased. Credit in the residential mortgage market remained widely availa- ble for borrowers with higher credit ratings but tight for households with low credit scores. Volumes of home- purchase mortgage originations declined in May and mortgage refinance volumes continued to fall. Con- sumer credit remained broadly available to households in April and May but respondents in the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s Survey of Consumer Expectations indicated that it was harder to get credit in recent months. That said, auto loans outstanding continued to grow at a robust pace in April and May but credit card balances moderated somewhat in May and June. The staff provided an update on its assessment of the stability of the financial system and, on balance, charac- terized the vulnerabilities of the U.S. financial system as moderate, down from notable in January. Equity and corporate debt prices declined significantly since the last assessment, reflecting concerns over slower _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Minutes of the Meeting of July 26–27, 2022 Page 5 growth and lower risk appetite in corporate markets. Declining risk appetite has also led to sharp declines in the price of some digital assets. The staff noted that dig- ital assets tended to be volatile. The staff also high- lighted the financial stability considerations associated with rapid growth in stablecoins, including their vulner- ability to runs and the opacity of many aspects of their operations. Residential real estate prices continued to rise, and the staff noted that although valuations have been elevated, mortgage underwriting standards have been stronger than in previous house-price cycles. CRE prices continued to rise, and valuation pressures ap- peared to be increasing. The staff assessed that households were in a better posi- tion than in the mid-2000s to weather a downturn in house prices, noting that mortgage debt growth has sig- nificantly lagged growth in house prices, leaving house- holds with substantial equity cushions. Moreover, for much of the past decade, most new mortgage debt had been added by borrowers with prime credit scores. In addition, the staff assessed that business leverage was high, but businesses maintained ample cash on hand and their credit quality remained strong. Further, the ability of most firms to service their debt was at a historically high level, as measured by the interest coverage ratio. The staff assessed that leverage in the financial sector remained moderate. Recent declines in bank capital ra- tios were due to higher volatility, interest rate increases, and loan growth, but the recently concluded stress tests suggested that participating banks could absorb losses from a severe recession without breaching regulatory minimums, and some banks were expected to increase their capital ratios later this year. Leverage at hedge funds and life insurance companies remained relatively high. Market liquidity had deteriorated in the oil and equities markets since January, but market functioning continued to be orderly. Yields offered by MMMFs were well above those offered by banks, and the staff noted that this yield differential would attract inflows to MMMFs. Noting the structural vulnerabilities associated with MMMFs, the staff highlighted the need to monitor the size and fragility of this sector and the progress of the Security and Exchange Commission’s recently proposed reforms. The staff noted that open-end bond and loan mutual funds, which are also vulnerable to large-scale in- vestor withdrawals, had experienced outflows as interest rates rose. These outflows had proceeded in an orderly manner. Staff Economic Outlook The projection for U.S. economic activity prepared by the staff for the July FOMC meeting was noticeably weaker than the June forecast, reflecting the economy’s reduced momentum and current and prospective finan- cial conditions that were expected to provide less sup- port to aggregate demand growth. As a result, while the projected level of real GDP remained above potential this year, the gap was expected to have closed by the sec- ond half of 2023. Similarly, the unemployment rate was projected to start rising in the second half of 2022 and to reach the staff’s estimate of its natural rate at the end of next year. Total PCE price inflation was expected to be 4.8 percent in 2022, and core inflation was expected to be 4.0 per- cent. Core PCE price inflation was expected to step down to 2.6 percent in 2023 and to 2.0 percent in 2024; the projected deceleration in core prices was attributable to the anticipated resolution of supply–demand imbal- ances, a labor market that was expected to become less tight over the projection period, and a projected decline in import price inflation. Total PCE inflation was ex- pected to decline to 2.2 percent in 2023 and to 1.9 per- cent in 2024, reflecting the anticipated slowing in core inflation and a projected rapid deceleration in consumer food and energy prices in coming quarters. The staff continued to judge that the risks to the baseline projection for real activity were skewed to the downside, noting that supply chain bottlenecks, Russia’s war against Ukraine, weak incoming data on spending, and the tightening in financial conditions since the start of the year supported this assessment. The staff viewed the risks to the inflation projection as skewed to the upside given the persistent upward surprises seen in the infla- tion data, the possibility that inflation expectations would become unanchored as a result of the large in- crease in actual inflation over the past year, and the risk that supply conditions would not improve as much as the baseline projection assumed. Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook In their discussion of current economic conditions, par- ticipants noted that recent indicators of spending and production had softened. Nonetheless, job gains had been robust in recent months, and the unemployment rate had remained low. Inflation remained elevated, re- flecting supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic, higher food and energy prices, and broader price pressures. Participants recognized that Russia’s war against Ukraine was causing tremendous human and Page 6 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ economic hardship. Participants judged that the war and related events were creating additional upward pressure on inflation and were weighing on global economic ac- tivity. Against this background, participants stated that they were highly attentive to inflation risks. With regard to current economic activity, participants noted that consumer expenditures, housing activity, business investment, and manufacturing production had all decelerated from the robust rates of growth seen in 2021. The labor market, however, remained strong. Participants observed that indicators of spending and production suggested that the second quarter of this year had seen a broad-based softening in economic activity. Many participants remarked that some of the slowing, particularly in the housing sector, reflected the emerging response of aggregate demand to the tightening of finan- cial conditions associated with the ongoing firming of monetary policy. The unwinding of the large-scale sup- port to consumer spending provided by pandemic-re- lated fiscal policy actions, the inflation-induced reduc- tion in real disposable income, and the move down in the demand for some products from the elevated levels seen in earlier stages of the pandemic had also all led to slower growth in households’ expenditures. In addition, a deterioration in the foreign economic outlook and a strong dollar were contributing to a weakening of exter- nal demand. Participants anticipated that U.S. real GDP would expand in the second half of the year, but many expected that growth in economic activity would be at a below-trend pace, as the period ahead would likely see the response of aggregate demand to tighter financial conditions become stronger and more broad based. Par- ticipants noted that a period of below-trend GDP growth would help reduce inflationary pressures and set the stage for the sustained achievement of the Commit- tee’s objectives of maximum employment and price sta- bility. In their discussion of the household sector, participants commented that they were seeing many signs in the data, and hearing reports from business contacts, of slower growth in consumer spending. Although the aggregate balance sheet for the household sector was strong and the unemployment rate was low, consumer sentiment had deteriorated, and households were reportedly be- coming more cautious in their expenditure decisions in light of uncertainty about the economic outlook and the reduction in purchasing power induced by price rises, particularly increases in the prices of essentials such as food, housing, and transportation. Participants also ob- served that housing activity had weakened notably, re- flecting the impact of higher mortgage interest rates and house prices on home affordability. Participants antici- pated that this slowdown in housing activity would con- tinue and also expected higher borrowing costs to lead to a slowing in other interest-sensitive household ex- penditures, such as purchases of durable goods. With respect to the business sector, participants noted that investment spending had likely declined in the sec- ond quarter. In addition, business survey data and infor- mation received from contacts indicated that manufac- turing orders and production had fallen in some Dis- tricts. Heightened uncertainty, concerns about inflation, tighter financial conditions, and a cutback in consumer spending had led firms to downgrade economic pro- spects. Some participants noted that their contacts were reporting that businesses were in the process of reevalu- ating their capital expenditure plans, though a few par- ticipants stated that some contacts had reported a degree of short-term momentum in business activity arising from existing orders and from the implementation of ex- pansion plans made before the tightening of financial conditions. A few participants indicated that some busi- ness contacts had assessed that demand and supply were beginning to come into better balance. Even so, con- tacts in many areas continued to report major supply chain disruptions and anticipated that these were likely to continue while also indicating that there were signs of improvement in supply conditions in some areas. Participants observed that the labor market remained strong, with the unemployment rate very low, job vacan- cies and quits close to historically high levels, and an el- evated rate of nominal wage growth. Many participants also noted, however, that there were some tentative signs of a softening outlook for the labor market: These signs included increases in weekly initial unemployment insurance claims, reductions in quit rates and vacancies, slower growth in payrolls than earlier in the year, and reports of cutbacks in hiring in some sectors. In addi- tion, although nominal wage growth remained strong ac- cording to a wide range of measures, there were some signs of a leveling off or edging down. In some Districts, contacts had suggested that labor demand–supply imbal- ances might be diminishing, with firms being more suc- cessful in hiring and retaining workers and under less pressure to raise wages. Some participants noted that the contribution that increases in labor supply could make to reducing labor market imbalances was likely limited, especially as the scope for labor force participa- tion to pick up was constrained by the ongoing move- ment of the large baby-boom cohort into their retire- ment years, while others highlighted factors holding down participation that could wane in the future, such _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Minutes of the Meeting of July 26–27, 2022 Page 7 as continuing pandemic-related concerns. Participants observed that, in part because of tighter financial condi- tions and an associated moderation in the growth of ag- gregate demand, growth in employment would likely slow further in the period ahead. They noted that this development would help bring labor demand and supply into better balance, reducing upward pressures on nom- inal wage growth and aiding the return of inflation to 2 percent. Several participants observed that the mod- eration in labor market conditions might well lag the slowdown in economic activity. Participants remarked that a moderation in labor market conditions would likely involve a decline in the number of job openings as well as a moderate increase in unemployment from the current very low rate. A couple of participants indicated that firms were keen to retain workers—a factor that could limit the increase in layoffs associated with a slow- ing labor market. Participants noted that indicators of spending and pro- duction pointed to less underlying strength in economic activity than was suggested by indicators of labor market activity. With employment growth still strong, the weak- ening in spending data implied unusually large negative readings on labor productivity growth for the year so far. Participants remarked that the strength of the labor mar- ket suggested that economic activity may be stronger than implied by the current GDP data, with several par- ticipants raising the possibility that the discrepancy might ultimately be resolved by GDP being revised up- ward. Several participants also observed, however, that the labor market might not be as tight as some indicators suggested, and they noted that data provided by the pay- roll processor ADP and employment as reported in the household survey both seemed to imply a softer labor market than that suggested by the still-robust growth in payroll employment as reported in the establishment survey. Participants observed that inflation remained unaccept- ably high and was well above the Committee’s longer- run goal of 2 percent. In light of the high CPI reading for June, participants noted that PCE inflation was likely to have increased further in that month. Participants further observed that inflationary pressures were broad based, a pattern reflected in large one-month increases in the trimmed mean CPI and core CPI measures. Par- ticipants remarked that, although recent declines in gas- oline prices would likely help produce lower headline in- flation rates in the short term, declines in the prices of oil and some other commodities could not be relied on as providing a basis for sustained lower inflation, as these prices could quickly rebound. Participants also noted that the high cost of living was an especially great burden on low- and middle-income households. Partic- ipants agreed that there was little evidence to date that inflation pressures were subsiding. They judged that in- flation would respond to monetary policy tightening and the associated moderation in economic activity with a delay and would likely stay uncomfortably high for some time. Participants also observed that in some product categories, the rate of price increase could well pick up further in the short run, with sizable additional increases in residential rental expenses being especially likely. Participants noted that supply bottlenecks were contin- uing to contribute to price pressures. There were, how- ever, some signs of gradual improvement in the supply situation—including improved availability of certain key materials, less upward pressure on input prices, and a de- cline in delivery times. Contacts reported that there were nevertheless substantial continuing challenges. Partici- pants judged that it would take considerable time for supply constraints to be resolved, and a few suggested that full resolution of supply difficulties would take longer than they previously assessed. Several partici- pants stressed that improvements in supply would be helpful but by themselves could not be relied on to re- solve the supply and demand imbalances in the economy sufficiently rapidly. Participants emphasized that a slow- ing in aggregate demand would play an important role in reducing inflation pressures. They expected that the ap- propriate firming of monetary policy and an eventual easing of supply and demand imbalances would bring in- flation back down to levels consistent with the Commit- tee’s longer-run objective and keep longer-term inflation expectations well anchored. Participants discussed a number of factors likely to be helpful in bringing infla- tion back down to 2 percent. In addition to the Com- mittee’s ongoing policy firming and anchored longer- term inflation expectations, these included competitive pressures restraining price increases, the apparent ab- sence of a wage–price spiral, the tightening of monetary policy abroad, and the impact of the appreciation of the dollar on import prices. However, they continued to view commodity price developments as a potential source of upward pressure on inflation. Participants noted that expectations of inflation were an important influence on the behavior of actual inflation and stressed that moving to an appropriately restrictive stance of policy was essential for avoiding an unanchor- ing of inflation expectations. Such an unanchoring would make achieving the Committee’s statutory objec- tives of maximum employment and price stability much more difficult. In assessing the current state of inflation Page 8 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ expectations, participants noted that recent readings on market-based measures of inflation compensation were consistent with longer-term inflation expectations re- maining anchored near 2 percent. They judged that this behavior of longer-term inflation expectations was likely partly due to the actual and expected firming of mone- tary policy and also likely reflected downward revisions to the growth of aggregate demand expected in coming years. In addition, several participants assessed that the Committee’s ongoing monetary policy tightening was helping alleviate concerns among market participants and wage and price setters that elevated inflation would become entrenched. Several participants observed that recent readings on survey measures of inflation expecta- tions were broadly consistent with the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run inflation objective, although a few participants noted that household surveys were indicat- ing increasing divergences in views about the likely longer-run rate of inflation. In their discussion of risks, participants emphasized that they were highly attentive to inflation risks and were closely monitoring developments regarding both infla- tion and inflation expectations. Uncertainty about the medium-term course of inflation remained high, and the balance of inflation risks remained skewed to the upside, with several participants highlighting the possibility of further supply shocks arising from commodity markets. Participants saw the risks to the outlook for real GDP growth as primarily being to the downside. These down- side risks included the possibility that the tightening in financial conditions would have a larger negative effect on economic activity than anticipated, that there would be further pandemic-related economic disruptions, or that geopolitical and global economic developments would lead to additional adverse economic or financial disturbances. Several of the participants who commented on issues re- lated to financial stability noted that, on balance, asset valuations had eased from elevated levels in recent months. High levels of capital and liquidity overall in the banking system, healthy household balance sheets, and the adoption of stronger mortgage underwriting standards following the Global Financial Crisis were also cited among the factors that fostered financial stability in the current environment. Several participants noted that financial market liquidity had been low in some ar- eas but that market functioning had, nonetheless, been orderly. Several participants emphasized the importance of avoiding complacency when assessing financial vul- nerabilities amid ever-changing economic and financial landscapes or the need to look at a broad range of pos- sible outcomes, including scenarios involving elevated inflation and rising interest rates, when assessing finan- cial vulnerabilities and stability. Some participants com- mented on the financial stability challenges posed by dig- ital assets. They noted that these assets, including sta- blecoins, were subject to vulnerabilities—such as runs, fire sales, and excessive leverage—similar to those asso- ciated with more traditional assets. While the recent tur- moil in digital asset markets had not spread to other asset classes, these participants saw digital assets’ rising im- portance and growing interconnectedness with other segments of the financial system as underscoring the need to establish a robust supervisory and regulatory framework for this industry that would appropriately limit potential systemic risks. A few participants men- tioned the need to strengthen the oversight and regula- tion of certain types of nonbank financial institutions. Several participants noted that capital at some of the largest banks had declined in recent quarters. These par- ticipants emphasized that it was important that the larg- est banks have strong capital positions and that appro- priate settings of regulatory and supervisory tools can help deliver that outcome. A couple of these partici- pants highlighted the potential role that usage of the countercyclical capital buffer could play in this context. In their consideration of the appropriate stance of mon- etary policy, participants concurred that the labor market was very tight and that inflation was far above the Com- mittee’s 2 percent inflation objective. Participants noted that recent indicators of spending and production had softened, while, by contrast, job gains had been robust and the unemployment rate had remained low. Against this backdrop, all participants agreed that it was appro- priate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate 75 basis points at this meeting and to continue the pro- cess of reducing the Federal Reserve’s securities hold- ings, as described in the Plans for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve’s Balance Sheet that the Committee issued in May. Participants observed that, following this meeting’s policy rate hike, the nominal federal funds rate would be within the range of their estimates of its longer-run neutral level. Even so, with inflation elevated and expected to remain so over the near term, some par- ticipants emphasized that the real federal funds rate would likely still be below shorter-run neutral levels after this meeting’s policy rate hike. In discussing potential policy actions at upcoming meet- ings, participants continued to anticipate that ongoing increases in the target range for the federal funds rate _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Minutes of the Meeting of July 26–27, 2022 Page 9 would be appropriate to achieve the Committee’s objec- tives. With inflation remaining well above the Commit- tee’s objective, participants judged that moving to a re- strictive stance of policy was required to meet the Com- mittee’s legislative mandate to promote maximum em- ployment and price stability. Participants concurred that the pace of policy rate increases and the extent of future policy tightening would depend on the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and risks to the outlook. Participants judged that, as the stance of monetary policy tightened further, it likely would become appropriate at some point to slow the pace of policy rate increases while assessing the effects of cumulative policy adjustments on economic activity and inflation. Some participants indicated that, once the policy rate had reached a sufficiently restrictive level, it likely would be appropriate to maintain that level for some time to ensure that inflation was firmly on a path back to 2 percent. Participants concurred that, in expeditiously raising the policy rate, the Committee was acting with resolve to lower inflation to 2 percent and anchor inflation expec- tations at levels consistent with that longer-run goal. Participants noted that the Committee’s credibility with regard to bringing inflation back to the 2 percent objec- tive, together with its forceful policy actions and com- munications, had already contributed to a notable tight- ening of financial conditions that would likely help re- duce inflation pressures by restraining aggregate de- mand. Participants pointed to some evidence suggesting that policy actions and communications about the future path of the federal funds rate were starting to affect the economy, most visibly in interest-sensitive sectors. Par- ticipants generally judged that the bulk of the effects on real activity had yet to be felt because of lags associated with the transmission of monetary policy, and that while a moderation in economic growth should support a re- turn of inflation to 2 percent, the effects of policy firm- ing on consumer prices were not yet apparent in the data. A number of participants posited that some of the effects of policy actions and communications were showing up more rapidly than had historically been the case, because the expeditious removal of policy accom- modation and supporting communications already had led to a significant tightening of financial conditions. In light of elevated inflation and the upside risks to the outlook for inflation, participants remarked that moving to a restrictive stance of the policy rate in the near term would also be appropriate from a risk-management per- spective because it would better position the Committee to raise the policy rate further, to appropriately restric- tive levels, if inflation were to run higher than expected. Participants judged that a significant risk facing the Committee was that elevated inflation could become en- trenched if the public began to question the Committee’s resolve to adjust the stance of policy sufficiently. If this risk materialized, it would complicate the task of return- ing inflation to 2 percent and could raise substantially the economic costs of doing so. Many participants re- marked that, in view of the constantly changing nature of the economic environment and the existence of long and variable lags in monetary policy’s effect on the econ- omy, there was also a risk that the Committee could tighten the stance of policy by more than necessary to restore price stability. These participants highlighted this risk as underscoring the importance of the Commit- tee’s data-dependent approach to judging the pace and magnitude of policy firming over coming quarters. Participants reaffirmed their strong commitment to re- turning inflation to the Committee’s 2 percent objective. Participants agreed that a return of inflation to the 2 per- cent objective was necessary for sustaining a strong labor market. Participants remarked that it would likely take some time for inflation to move down to the Commit- tee’s objective. Participants added that the course of in- flation would be influenced by various nonmonetary fac- tors, including developments associated with Russia’s war against Ukraine and with supply chain disruptions. Participants recognized that policy firming could slow the pace of economic growth, but they saw the return of inflation to 2 percent as critical to achieving maximum employment on a sustained basis. Committee Policy Action In their discussion of monetary policy for this meeting, members agreed that recent indicators of spending and production had softened. Members also concurred that, nonetheless, job gains had been robust in recent months and the unemployment rate had remained low. Mem- bers agreed that inflation remained elevated, reflecting supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic, higher food and energy prices, and broader price pres- sures. In describing the sources of elevated inflation, members judged it pertinent to add a reference to higher food prices to the statement because of the notable rise in these prices and the importance of food items in households’ budgets. Members concurred that Russia’s war against Ukraine was causing tremendous human and economic hardship. They also agreed that the war and related events were creating additional upward pressure on inflation and Page 10 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ were weighing on global economic activity. Members remarked that they remained highly attentive to inflation risks. Amid evidence that COVID-related lockdowns in China had generally been lifted and had affected supply chains only modestly, members generally considered it appropriate to omit from the July statement the sentence that appeared in the June statement indicating that these lockdowns were likely to exacerbate supply chain disrup- tions. In their assessment of the monetary policy stance neces- sary for achieving the Committee’s maximum-employ- ment and price-stability goals, the Committee decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 2¼ to 2½ percent and anticipated that ongoing increases in the target range would be appropriate. In addition, mem- bers agreed that the Committee would continue reduc- ing the Federal Reserve’s holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency MBS, as described in the Plans for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve’s Bal- ance Sheet that were issued in May. Members agreed that, in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, they would continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and that they would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate in the event that risks emerged that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals. They also concurred that their assessments would take into account a wide range of in- formation, including readings on public health, labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation ex- pectations, and financial and international develop- ments. Members affirmed that the Committee was strongly committed to returning inflation to its 2 percent objective. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the fol- lowing domestic policy directive, for release at 2:00 p.m.: “Effective July 28, 2022, the Federal Open Mar- ket Committee directs the Desk to: • Undertake open market operations as nec- essary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of 2¼ to 2½ percent. • Conduct overnight repurchase agreement operations with a minimum bid rate of 2.5 percent and with an aggregate operation limit of $500 billion; the aggregate opera- tion limit can be temporarily increased at the discretion of the Chair. • Conduct overnight reverse repurchase agreement operations at an offering rate of 2.3 percent and with a per-counterparty limit of $160 billion per day; the per-coun- terparty limit can be temporarily increased at the discretion of the Chair. • Roll over at auction the amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s hold- ings of Treasury securities maturing in the calendar months of July and August that ex- ceeds a cap of $30 billion per month. Re- deem Treasury coupon securities up to this monthly cap and Treasury bills to the extent that coupon principal payments are less than the monthly cap. • Starting in the calendar month of Septem- ber, roll over at auction the amount of prin- cipal payments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of Treasury securities maturing in each calendar month that exceeds a cap of $60 billion per month. Redeem Treasury coupon securities up to this monthly cap and Treasury bills to the extent that coupon principal payments are less than the monthly cap. • Reinvest into agency mortgage-backed se- curities (MBS) the amount of principal pay- ments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of agency debt and agency MBS received in the calendar months of July and August that exceeds a cap of $17.5 billion per month. • Starting in the calendar month of Septem- ber, reinvest into agency MBS the amount of principal payments from the Federal Re- serve’s holdings of agency debt and agency MBS received in each calendar month that exceeds a cap of $35 billion per month. • Allow modest deviations from stated amounts for reinvestments, if needed for operational reasons. • Engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settle- ment of the Federal Reserve’s agency MBS transactions.” _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Minutes of the Meeting of July 26–27, 2022 Page 11 The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below for release at 2:00 p.m.: “Recent indicators of spending and production have softened. Nonetheless, job gains have been robust in recent months, and the unem- ployment rate has remained low. Inflation re- mains elevated, reflecting supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic, higher food and energy prices, and broader price pressures. Russia’s war against Ukraine is causing tremen- dous human and economic hardship. The war and related events are creating additional up- ward pressure on inflation and are weighing on global economic activity. The Committee is highly attentive to inflation risks. The Committee seeks to achieve maximum em- ployment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. In support of these goals, the Committee decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 2¼ to 2½ percent and anticipates that ongoing increases in the tar- get range will be appropriate. In addition, the Committee will continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities, as described in the Plans for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve’s Balance Sheet that were issued in May. The Committee is strongly committed to returning inflation to its 2 percent objective. In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals. The Committee’s assessments will take into account a wide range of information, in- cluding readings on public health, labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation ex- pectations, and financial and international de- velopments.” Voting for this action: Jerome H. Powell, John C. Williams, Michael S. Barr, Michelle W. Bowman, Lael Brainard, James Bullard, Susan M. Collins, Lisa D. Cook, Esther L. George, Philip N. Jefferson, Loretta J. Mester, and Christopher J. Waller. Voting against this action: None. To support the Committee’s decision to raise the target range for the federal funds rate, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted unanimously to raise the interest rate paid on reserve balances to 2.4 per- cent, effective July 28, 2022. The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted unanimously to ap- prove a ¾ percentage point increase in the primary credit rate to 2.5 percent, effective July 28, 2022.6 It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Tuesday–Wednesday, September 20– 21, 2022. The meeting adjourned at 10:35 a.m. on July 27, 2022. Notation Vote By notation vote completed on July 5, 2022, the Com- mittee unanimously approved the minutes of the Com- mittee meeting held on June 14–15, 2022. _______________________ James A. Clouse Secretary 6 In taking this action, the Board approved requests to estab- lish that rate submitted by the boards of directors of the Fed- eral Reserve Banks of Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Cleve- land, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, and San Francisco. This vote also encompassed approval by the Board of Gover- nors of the establishment of a 2.5 percent primary credit rate by the remaining Federal Reserve Banks, effective on the later of July 28, 2022, or the date such Reserve Banks inform the Secretary of the Board of such a request. (Secretary’s note: Subsequently, the Federal Reserve Banks of St. Louis, Minne- apolis, and Kansas City were informed of the Board’s approval of their establishment of a primary credit rate of 2.5 percent, effective July 28, 2022.)

U.S. financial conditions tightened over the period, largely reflecting an upward revision in investors’ out- look for the path of the policy rate. Treasury yields climbed substantially, with most of the upward move re- flected in real yields. Equity prices initially rose amid second-quarter earnings reports that were better than feared but later retraced those gains in response to the shifting policy outlook. Regarding international devel- opments, yields in most advanced foreign economies (AFEs) also rose sharply as a number of other central banks lifted policy rates and indicated in their communi- cations that they would likely continue to tighten mone- tary policy in order to address inflation pressures. The exchange value of the dollar appreciated notably, reach- ing multidecade highs in real terms, as market partici- pants perceived mounting economic challenges abroad. The market-implied path of the federal funds rate shifted sharply higher after market participants interpreted Fed- eral Reserve communications—particularly those pro- vided at the Jackson Hole symposium—along with in- coming data, as indicating a more restrictive path of pol- icy than previously expected. Policy-sensitive rates sug- gested that a 75 basis point increase in the target range for the federal funds rate was widely expected to be de- cided on at the Committee’s September meeting, with some chance of a 100 basis point move. In addition, the market-implied path suggested reasonable odds of addi- tional 75 basis point and 50 basis point rate increases at the November and December meetings, respectively. Market participants generally anticipated a further slow- ing in the pace of rate increases after December, with the peak policy rate being reached in the first half of 2023. Beyond that period, the market-implied path of the fed- eral funds rate sloped downward, likely reflecting down- side risks to the policy rate path. The median respond- ent to the Open Market Desk surveys expected the pol- icy rate path to remain flat through 2023 after the peak rate was reached. On average, Desk survey respondents assigned an almost 30 percent probability to a decline in real gross domestic product (GDP) over 2022, nearly double the probability assigned in the July survey. The manager pro tem turned next to a discussion of pol- icy implementation. Balance sheet runoff had continued to proceed smoothly over the intermeeting period. With caps on redemptions of Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) doubling in Septem- ber, the pace of balance sheet runoff was set to increase over coming months. The markets for Treasury securi- ties and agency MBS continued to function in an orderly manner, though liquidity conditions in both markets re- mained low, reflecting elevated interest rate uncertainty. In money markets, the 75 basis point increase in the tar- get range at the July meeting passed through fully to overnight rates. Amid strong demand for short-term in- vestments, take-up at the overnight reverse repurchase agreement (ON RRP) facility was relatively steady at el- evated levels. The staff continued to anticipate that ON RRP take-up would decline in coming quarters from its currently ele- vated levels as money market participants responded to shifting conditions. Issuance of short-term securities was likely to increase in coming periods, and, as more clarity emerged in the economic and policy outlook, de- mand for short-term assets could moderate. Both of these developments would ease downward pressure on yields on safe short-term investments. The gradual re- duction in ON RRP balances could also be facilitated by rising competition among banks in seeking deposits. The manager pro tem indicated that the staff would con- tinue to monitor money market developments closely in order to assess whether any frictions were emerging in this process. The manager pro tem concluded with an update on op- erational matters. As expected, Federal Reserve net in- come turned negative in September. The staff expected that the size of the associated deferred asset would in- crease over time until net income turned positive, likely in a few years. The Desk planned to begin aggregation of those agency MBS held in the System Open Market Account (SOMA) that are not eligible to be commingled into Uniform MBS and, specifically, the Freddie Mac MBS that were issued before June 2019 and have a 45-day payment delay; decisions about any additional ag- gregations would be made at a later date. By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk’s domestic transactions over the intermeeting period. There were no intervention operations in foreign curren- cies for the System’s account during the intermeeting pe- riod. Minutes of the Meeting of September 20–21, 2022 Page 3 _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Staff Review of the Economic Situation The information available at the time of the Septem- ber 20–21 meeting suggested that U.S. real GDP was in- creasing at a modest pace in the third quarter after hav- ing declined over the first half of the year. Labor de- mand remained strong, and the labor market continued to be very tight. Recent monthly readings indicated that consumer price inflation—as measured by the 12-month percentage change in the price index for personal con- sumption expenditures (PCE)—remained elevated. Total nonfarm payroll employment posted robust gains in July and August at an average pace that was only slightly below what was seen over the first half of the year. The unemployment rate edged up, on net, from 3.6 percent in June to 3.7 percent in August. The unem- ployment rate for African Americans increased over this period, while the rate for Hispanics moved up slightly on net; both rates were noticeably higher than the national average. The labor force participation rate and employment-to-population ratio both rose, on net, from June to August. The private-sector job openings rate, as measured by the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Sur- vey, moved slightly lower from May to July but remained at a high level. Nominal wage growth continued to be rapid and broad based: Average hourly earnings rose 5.2 percent over the 12 months ending in August, while the employment cost index of hourly compensation in the private sector, which also includes benefit costs, rose 5.5 percent over the 12 months ending in June, 2.4 per- centage points faster than the year-earlier pace. Consumer price inflation remained elevated. Total PCE price inflation was 6.3 percent over the 12 months end- ing in July, and core PCE price inflation, which excludes changes in consumer energy prices and many consumer food prices, was 4.6 percent over the same period. The trimmed mean measure of 12-month PCE price infla- tion constructed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas was 4.4 percent in July. In August, the 12-month change in the consumer price index (CPI) was 8.3 percent, while core CPI inflation was 6.3 percent over the same period. Survey-based measures of short-run inflation expecta- tions declined in recent weeks, while measures of longer- term inflation expectations remained roughly stable or moved lower. Available spending indicators, including the August re- tail sales report, suggested that real PCE was on track to post a modest gain in the third quarter. However, the latest housing market data pointed to another sharp con- traction in residential investment in the third quarter, and business fixed investment appeared to be rising at a tepid pace. Real goods exports stepped up in June and then rose fur- ther in July, led by increases in exports of industrial sup- plies. By contrast, real goods imports stepped down in June and then fell sharply in July, driven by a large de- cline in consumer goods imports. Exports and imports of services continued to be held back by an incomplete recovery of international travel. The nominal U.S. inter- national trade deficit continued to narrow in June and July. Altogether, net exports contributed positively to GDP growth in the second quarter and appeared on track to make another positive contribution in the third quarter. Data pointed to weak foreign growth in recent months, weighed down by the global reverberations from Rus- sia’s war against Ukraine and a loss of momentum in the Chinese economy. In Europe, further disruptions to the supply of energy exacerbated declines in real disposable incomes and in consumer and business confidence, re- straining economic activity. In China, recent indicators suggest only a partial rebound from the effects of earlier severe COVID-19-related lockdowns as well as increas- ing concerns about the property sector. Weaker growth in China and the broader global economy also weighed on export-oriented emerging market economies in Asia. Consumer price inflation rose further in August in many foreign economies, reflecting past increases in energy and food prices, but also a continued broadening of in- flationary pressure to core prices. With inflation persis- tently high, many central banks continued to tighten monetary policy. Staff Review of the Financial Situation Over the intermeeting period, U.S. Treasury yields and the market-implied federal funds rate path moved higher. Broad domestic equity price indexes decreased slightly, on balance, but market volatility remained ele- vated. Credit remained widely available to most types of borrowers, but increases in borrowing costs appeared to damp the demand for credit in some markets in recent months. Measures of current loan performance for businesses and most households remained generally sta- ble. However, more recently, expectations of future credit quality for businesses deteriorated slightly, and de- linquency rates rose for some types of credit owed by households with low credit scores. The expected path of the federal funds rate—implied by a straight read of financial market quotes—rose in the period since the July FOMC meeting, largely reflecting Page 4 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ more-restrictive-than-expected monetary policy com- munications amid stronger-than-expected economic data and ongoing concerns about high inflation. On net, nominal Treasury yields increased significantly across the maturity spectrum. The increases in nominal Treas- ury yields were primarily accounted for by rising real yields, while inflation compensation measures declined substantially at short horizons and remained relatively little changed at medium- and longer-term horizons. Broad equity price indexes decreased slightly, on net, as substantial early gains arising from investors’ improved perceptions about the inflation outlook and better-than- feared second-quarter earnings were more than offset by later losses arising from expectations that the Committee would follow a more restrictive policy than previously expected. One-month option-implied volatility on the S&P 500—the VIX—increased somewhat, on net, and remained elevated by historical norms, partly reflecting investor uncertainty and risks associated with higher in- flation and the expected move to a restrictive policy stance. Corporate bond spreads narrowed slightly, on net, and remained roughly at the midpoints of their his- torical distributions. Reflecting increases in both policy rates and corporate bond spreads, yields on corporate bonds rose significantly since the start of the year. Mu- nicipal bond spreads over comparable-maturity Treasury yields widened a touch. Conditions in short-term funding markets remained sta- ble over the intermeeting period, with the July increase in the Federal Reserve’s administered interest rates pass- ing through quickly to other money market rates. Al- though secured overnight rates firmed slightly later in the intermeeting period, they remained soft relative to the ON RRP offering rate—a configuration that market participants attributed to relatively low Treasury bill sup- ply combined with strong investor demand for short- dated instruments amid uncertainty about the future path of the policy rate. Consistent with continued soft- ness in repurchase agreement rates, daily take-up in the ON RRP facility remained elevated. Spreads on lower- rated short-term commercial paper changed little on net. Bank deposit rates continued to increase modestly in August, following a lagged response to increases in the federal funds rate, while money market mutual funds’ net yields rose along with the increases in short-term rates. Sovereign yields in most AFEs rose notably over the in- termeeting period as major central banks raised their policy rates and communicated a tighter stance of future policy in the face of persistent inflationary pressures. Yields on Japanese government securities, however, ended the period little changed, as the Bank of Japan re- affirmed its accommodative monetary policy stance. Measures of foreign inflation compensation were vola- tile amid large swings in European natural gas prices but increased moderately on net. The U.S. dollar appreci- ated further against most major currencies, reaching multi-decade highs against the euro, the British pound, and the Japanese yen. The dollar’s strength largely re- flected increasing investor concerns about the global growth outlook as well as widening interest rate differ- entials between the United States and Japan. Growth concerns also weighed on foreign equity prices, which declined moderately. Outflows from funds dedicated to emerging markets continued at a modest pace, and credit spreads in emerging market economies narrowed some- what on net. In domestic credit markets, borrowing costs continued to rise over the intermeeting period. Yields on both cor- porate bonds and institutional leveraged loans increased. Bank interest rates for commercial and industrial (C&I) and commercial real estate (CRE) loans also increased. Among small businesses that borrow on a regular basis, the share of firms facing higher borrowing costs contin- ued to climb through August. Municipal bond yields in- creased across ratings categories. Borrowing costs for residential mortgage loans increased and reached their highest levels since 2008. Interest rates on most credit card accounts continued to move higher, in line with the rise in the federal funds rate, and auto loan interest rates rose steadily through August. Credit remained generally available to businesses and households, but high borrowing costs appeared to re- duce the demand for credit, resulting in lower financing volumes in some markets. Issuance of nonfinancial cor- porate bonds slowed further in July from the weak levels seen in the second quarter but rebounded somewhat in August and so far in September. Gross institutional lev- eraged loan issuance increased modestly in July from subdued levels but continued to be weak in August. Eq- uity issuance remained depressed, while issuance of mu- nicipal bonds was sluggish over the summer and so far in September. According to the July Senior Loan Officer Opinion Sur- vey on Bank Lending Practices, banks tightened credit standards on C&I lending for the first time in two years, but C&I loans on banks’ balance sheets expanded at a strong pace in July and August, reflecting strong demand from nonfinancial businesses. CRE loans on banks’ bal- Minutes of the Meeting of September 20–21, 2022 Page 5 _____________________________________________________________________________________________ ance sheets also continued to grow robustly, but issu- ance of commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) slowed in July from its strong pace earlier in the year. Credit availability to small businesses appeared to be tightening somewhat. The share of small firms reporting that it was more difficult to obtain loans continued its upward trend in August but remained lower than its his- torical average. Credit in the residential mortgage market remained avail- able for high-credit-score borrowers. Credit availability for low-credit-score borrowers continued to ease through July but remained modestly tight—close to pre- pandemic averages. However, the volumes of both home-purchase and refinance mortgage originations plunged in July amid rising mortgage rates. Consumer credit remained available to most households in June and July, but about half of the respondents in the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s Survey of Consumer Ex- pectations indicated that it was harder to obtain credit than it was a year earlier and that they expected it to be- come even harder over the next year. The credit quality of nonfinancial corporations remained generally strong, with low default rates for both corpo- rate bonds and leveraged loans. The volume of rating upgrades in the corporate bond market outpaced that of downgrades in July and August, but, so far in September, these relative volumes reversed. The volume of rating downgrades in the leveraged loan market continued to exceed that of upgrades. Credit quality for C&I and CRE loans on banks’ balance sheets also remained sound, as delinquency rates remained at low levels through June. However, banks increased loan loss pro- visions somewhat in the second quarter. Delinquency rates on CRE loans securitized into CMBS remained un- changed in July, delinquency rates on small business loans stayed quite low after edging up, and the credit quality of municipal securities remained strong. Household credit quality stayed broadly solid but con- tinued to worsen for some types of credit owed by bor- rowers with low credit scores. Mortgage delinquencies trended down in recent months, and the share of mort- gages in foreclosure remained low in July. By contrast, credit card and auto credit delinquency rates rose over the second quarter, particularly among subprime bor- rowers, with subprime auto loan delinquency rates re- bounding notably to slightly above their historical aver- ages. Staff Economic Outlook The projection for U.S. economic activity prepared by the staff for the September FOMC meeting was slightly weaker than the July forecast. However, the staff’s esti- mate of potential output in recent history was revised down significantly in response to continued disappoint- ing productivity growth and the sluggish gains in labor force participation seen so far this year; moreover, this lower trajectory for potential output was expected to persist throughout the forecast period. As a result, the staff’s estimate of the output gap was revised up consid- erably this year, and while the staff projection still had the output gap closing in coming years, the level of out- put was expected to be slightly above potential at the end of 2025. Likewise, the unemployment rate was expected to rise more slowly than in the July projection and to be slightly below the staff’s estimate of its natural rate at the end of 2025. On a 12-month change basis, total PCE price inflation was expected to be 5.1 percent in 2022, and core infla- tion was expected to be 4.3 percent. Although the staff continued to project that core inflation would step down over the next two years—reflecting the anticipated reso- lution of supply–demand imbalances and a labor market that was expected to become less tight—core inflation was revised up in each year of the projection. In 2025, core inflation was expected to be 2.1 percent. Total PCE price inflation was expected to decline to 2.6 per- cent in 2023 as core inflation slowed and energy prices declined. Total PCE inflation was expected to move down further in 2024, to 2 percent, and to remain at 2 percent in 2025. The staff continued to judge that the risks to the baseline projection for real activity were skewed to the downside. In addition to Russia’s war in Ukraine, weakening activ- ity abroad, and ongoing supply chain bottlenecks, the possibility that a persistent reduction in inflation could require a greater-than-assumed amount of tightening in financial conditions was viewed by the staff as a salient downside risk to their forecast for real activity. The staff viewed the risks to the inflation projection as skewed to the upside on the grounds that supply conditions might not improve as much as expected and energy prices might rise sharply again. The staff also pointed to the possibility that wage increases could put a greater-than- expected amount of upward pressure on price inflation and the possibility that inflation expectations could be- come unanchored given the large rise in inflation seen over the past year as additional upside risks to the infla- tion forecast. Page 6 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, participants submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and infla- tion for each year from 2022 through 2025 and over the longer run, based on their individual assessments of ap- propriate monetary policy, including the path of the fed- eral funds rate. The longer-run projections represented each participant’s assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, un- der appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy. A Summary of Eco- nomic Projections was released to the public following the conclusion of the meeting. In their discussion of current economic conditions, par- ticipants noted that recent indicators had pointed to modest growth in spending and production. Job gains had been robust in recent months, and the unemploy- ment rate had remained low. Inflation remained ele- vated, reflecting supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic, higher food and energy prices, and broader price pressures. Participants recognized that Russia’s war against Ukraine was causing tremendous human and economic hardship. Participants judged that the war and related events were creating additional up- ward pressure on inflation and were weighing on global economic activity. Against this background, participants remained highly attentive to inflation risks. With regard to the economic outlook, participants noted that recent data pointed to modest growth in economic activity over the second half of this year. Participants observed that recent indicators of consumer spending and business investment suggested modest increases in those spending categories but noted that activity in in- terest-sensitive sectors weakened appreciably. Partici- pants revised down their projections of real GDP growth for this year from their projections in June. Sev- eral participants noted that the continued strength in the labor market, as well as the data on gross domestic in- come, raised the possibility that the current GDP data could understate the strength in economic activity this year. Participants generally anticipated that the U.S. economy would grow at a below-trend pace in this and the coming few years, with the labor market becoming less tight, as monetary policy assumed a restrictive stance and global headwinds persisted. Participants noted that a period of below-trend real GDP growth would help reduce inflationary pressures and set the stage for the sustained achievement of the Committee’s objectives of maximum employment and price stability. In their discussion of the household sector, participants noted that consumer spending grew moderately, reflect- ing strength in the labor market, the elevated level of household savings accumulated during the pandemic, and a strong aggregate household-sector balance sheet. Several participants noted that spending appeared to have held up relatively well, especially among higher-in- come households. These participants also noted that the composition of spending by low-to-moderate-income households—who were affected to a greater degree by high food, energy, and shelter prices—was changing, with discretionary expenditures being cut and purchases shifting to lower-cost options. Participants observed that the notable slowdown in residential investment and other interest-sensitive spending had continued, reflect- ing the effect of the Committee’s monetary policy ac- tions and tighter financial conditions. With regard to the business sector, participants observed that growth in investment spending appeared modest. Several participants mentioned that manufacturing activ- ity had slowed. A couple of participants noted that busi- nesses were constrained in undertaking new capital pro- jects, as they faced higher financing costs, persistent challenges associated with supply bottlenecks, and hiring difficulties resulting from the continued tightness of the labor market. Participants discussed how they perceived challenging supply conditions to be evolving. Many participants re- marked that their business contacts were reporting signs of relief in supply bottlenecks, such as declines in ship- ping costs and delivery times and rising inventories, while several participants saw little improvement in the supply situation. Participants saw supply bottlenecks as likely continuing for a while longer, and a couple com- mented that constraints on production were increasingly taking the form of labor shortages rather than parts shortages. Participants observed that the labor market had re- mained very tight, as evidenced by a historically low un- employment rate, elevated job vacancies and quit rates, a low pace of layoffs, robust employment gains, and high nominal wage growth. A few participants remarked that employers facing particularly acute labor shortages were those associated with professional occupations, service industries, skilled trades, and smaller firms. Some par- ticipants noted a number of developments consistent with the labor market moving toward better balance, in- cluding a lower rate of job turnover, a moderation in em- ployment growth, and an increase in the labor force par- ticipation rate for prime-age workers. However, several Minutes of the Meeting of September 20–21, 2022 Page 7 _____________________________________________________________________________________________ participants assessed that the scope for further improve- ment in labor force participation was likely limited, es- pecially in view of the sizable contribution that retire- ments had made to the previous decline in the participa- tion rate. Participants anticipated that the supply and demand im- balances in the labor market would gradually diminish and the unemployment rate would likely rise somewhat, importantly reflecting the effects of tighter monetary policy. Participants judged that a softening in the labor market would be needed to ease upward pressures on wages and prices. Participants expected that the transi- tion toward a softer labor market would be accompanied by an increase in the unemployment rate. Several com- mented that they considered it likely that the transition would occur primarily through reduced job vacancies and slower job creation. A couple of participants re- marked that, in light of challenges in hiring, businesses might be less willing to reduce their staffing levels in the event of a weakening in general economic activity. A few participants particularly stressed the high uncer- tainty associated with the expected future path of the un- employment rate and commented that the unemploy- ment rate could rise by considerably more than in the staff forecast. Participants observed that inflation remained unaccept- ably high and well above the Committee’s longer-run goal of 2 percent. Participants commented that recent inflation data generally had come in above expectations and that, correspondingly, inflation was declining more slowly than they had previously been anticipating. Price pressures had remained elevated and had persisted across a broad array of product categories. Energy prices had declined in recent months but remained con- siderably higher than in 2021, and upside risks to energy prices remained. Several participants noted the contin- ued elevated rates of increase in core goods prices. These participants considered this development as po- tentially indicating that the shift of household spending from goods to services might be having a smaller effect on goods prices than they expected or that the supply bottlenecks and labor shortages were taking longer to be resolved. Participants commented that they expected in- flation pressures to persist in the near term. Numerous contributing factors were cited as supporting this view, including labor market tightness and the resulting up- ward pressure on nominal wages, continuing supply chain disruptions, and the persistent nature of increases in services prices, particularly shelter prices. With respect to the medium term, participants judged that inflation pressures would gradually recede in com- ing years. Various factors were cited as likely to contrib- ute to this outcome, including the Committee’s tighten- ing of its policy stance, a gradual easing of supply and demand imbalances in labor and product markets, and the likelihood that weaker consumer demand would re- sult in a reduction of business profit margins from their current elevated levels. A few participants reported that business contacts in certain retail sectors—such as used cars and apparel—were planning to cut prices in order to help reduce their inventories. Several participants commented that while households across the income distribution were burdened by elevated inflation, those at the lower end of the income distribution were partic- ularly harmed, as a larger share of their income was spent on housing and other necessities. In assessing inflation expectations, participants noted that longer-term expectations appeared to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters as well as measures obtained from financial markets. Participants remarked that the Committee’s affirmation of its strong commitment to its price-stability objective, together with its forceful policy actions, had likely helped keep longer- run inflation expectations anchored. Some stressed that a more prolonged period of elevated inflation would in- crease the risk of inflation expectations becoming unan- chored, making it much more costly to bring inflation down. A few participants discussed the increased dis- persion of longer-term inflation expectations across re- spondents in various surveys, with an increase in the number of respondents reporting relatively low expecta- tions of future inflation acknowledged as a key driver of the increased dispersion but with a couple of participants citing higher inflation expectations among some survey respondents as a cause for concern and a reason not to be complacent about longer-term inflation expectations remaining well anchored. Participants agreed that the uncertainty associated with their economic outlooks was high and that risks to their inflation outlook were weighted to the upside. Some participants noted rising labor tensions, a new round of global energy price increases, further disruptions in sup- ply chains, and a larger-than-expected pass-through of wage increases into price increases as potential shocks that, if they materialized, could compound an already challenging inflation problem. A number of participants commented that a wage–price spiral had not yet devel- oped but cited its possible emergence as a risk. Page 8 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Participants broadly judged the risks to real GDP growth to be weighted to the downside, with various global headwinds most prominently cited as contributing fac- tors. These global headwinds included heightened risk of recession in Europe, a slowdown in economic activity occurring in China, and the ongoing global economic implications of Russia’s war against Ukraine. Several participants noted that the monetary policy tightening under way in many other economies would affect global financial markets and foreign real GDP growth, with the potential for spillovers to the U.S. economy. In their consideration of the appropriate stance of mon- etary policy, participants concurred that the labor market was very tight and that inflation was far above the Com- mittee’s 2 percent inflation objective. Participants ob- served that recent indicators of production and spending had pointed to modest growth, while job gains had been robust and the unemployment rate had remained low. Against this backdrop, all participants agreed that it was appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate 75 basis points at this meeting and to continue the process of reducing the Federal Reserve’s securities holdings, as described in the Plans for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve’s Balance Sheet that the Commit- tee issued in May. Policymakers observed that the rate hike at this meeting was another step toward making the Committee’s monetary policy stance sufficiently restric- tive to help ease supply and demand imbalances and to bring inflation back to 2 percent. Participants reaffirmed their strong commitment to returning inflation to the Committee’s 2 percent objective, with many stressing the importance of staying on this course even as the la- bor market slowed. In discussing potential policy actions at upcoming meet- ings, participants continued to anticipate that ongoing increases in the target range for the federal funds rate would be appropriate to achieve the Committee’s objec- tives. Participants judged that the Committee needed to move to, and then maintain, a more restrictive policy stance in order to meet the Committee’s legislative man- date to promote maximum employment and price stabil- ity. Many participants noted that, with inflation well above the Committee’s 2 percent objective and showing little sign so far of abating, and with supply and demand imbalances in the economy continuing, they had raised their assessment of the path of the federal funds rate that would likely be needed to achieve the Committee’s goals. Participants judged that the pace and extent of policy rate increases would continue to depend on the implica- tions of incoming information for the outlook for eco- nomic activity and inflation and on risks to the outlook. Several participants noted that, particularly in the current highly uncertain global economic and financial environ- ment, it would be important to calibrate the pace of fur- ther policy tightening with the aim of mitigating the risk of significant adverse effects on the economic outlook. Participants observed that, as the stance of monetary policy tightened further, it would become appropriate at some point to slow the pace of policy rate increases while assessing the effects of cumulative policy adjust- ments on economic activity and inflation. Many partici- pants indicated that, once the policy rate had reached a sufficiently restrictive level, it likely would be appropri- ate to maintain that level for some time until there was compelling evidence that inflation was on course to re- turn to the 2 percent objective. Participants noted that, in keeping with the Committee’s Plans for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve’s Balance Sheet, balance sheet runoff had moved up to its maximum planned pace in September and would continue at that pace. They further observed that a significant reduction in the Committee’s holdings of securities was in progress and that this process was contributing to the move to a re- strictive policy stance. A couple of participants re- marked that, after the process of balance sheet reduction was well under way, it would be appropriate for the Committee to consider sales of agency MBS in order to enable suitable progress toward a longer-run SOMA portfolio composed primarily of Treasury securities. In their assessment of the effects of policy actions and communications to date, participants concurred that the Committee’s actions to raise expeditiously the target range for the federal funds rate demonstrated its resolve to lower inflation to 2 percent and to keep inflation ex- pectations anchored at levels consistent with that longer- run goal. Participants noted that the Committee’s com- mitment to restoring price stability, together with its pur- poseful policy actions and communications, had con- tributed to a notable tightening of financial conditions over the past year that would likely help reduce inflation pressures by restraining aggregate demand. Participants observed that this tightening had led to substantial in- creases in real interest rates across the maturity spec- trum. Most participants remarked that, although some interest-sensitive categories of spending—such as hous- ing and business fixed investment—had already started to respond to the tightening of financial conditions, a sizable portion of economic activity had yet to display much response. They noted also that inflation had not yet responded appreciably to policy tightening and that a significant reduction in inflation would likely lag that Minutes of the Meeting of September 20–21, 2022 Page 9 _____________________________________________________________________________________________ of aggregate demand. Participants observed that a pe- riod of real GDP growth below its trend rate, very likely accompanied by some softening in labor market condi- tions, was required. They agreed that, by moving its pol- icy purposefully toward an appropriately restrictive stance, the Committee would help ensure that elevated inflation did not become entrenched and that inflation expectations did not become unanchored. These policy moves would therefore prevent the far greater economic pain associated with entrenched high inflation, including the even tighter policy and more severe restraint on eco- nomic activity that would then be needed to restore price stability. In light of the broad-based and unacceptably high level of inflation, the intermeeting news of higher-than- expected inflation, and upside risks to the inflation out- look, participants remarked that purposefully moving to a restrictive policy stance in the near term was consistent with risk-management considerations. Many partici- pants emphasized that the cost of taking too little action to bring down inflation likely outweighed the cost of tak- ing too much action. Several participants underlined the need to maintain a restrictive stance for as long as nec- essary, with a couple of these participants stressing that historical experience demonstrated the danger of prem- aturely ending periods of tight monetary policy designed to bring down inflation. Several participants observed that as policy moved into restrictive territory, risks would become more two-sided, reflecting the emergence of the downside risk that the cumulative restraint in ag- gregate demand would exceed what was required to bring inflation back to 2 percent. A few of these partic- ipants noted that this possibility was heightened by fac- tors beyond the Committee’s actions, including the tightening of monetary policy stances abroad and the weakening global economic outlook, that were also likely to restrain domestic economic activity in the period ahead. Committee Policy Action In their discussion of monetary policy for this meeting, members agreed that recent indicators had pointed to modest growth in spending and production. Members also concurred that job gains had been robust in recent months and the unemployment rate had remained low. Members agreed that inflation remained elevated, re- flecting supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic, higher food and energy prices, and broader price pressures. Members observed that Russia’s war against Ukraine was causing tremendous human and economic hardship. They also agreed that the war and related events were creating additional upward pressure on inflation and were weighing on global economic activity. Members remarked that they remained highly attentive to inflation risks. In their assessment of the monetary policy stance neces- sary for achieving the Committee’s maximum-employ- ment and price-stability goals, the Committee decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 3 to 3¼ percent and anticipated that ongoing increases in the target range would be appropriate. In addition, mem- bers agreed that the Committee would continue reduc- ing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency MBS, as described in the Plans for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve’s Balance Sheet issued in May. Members agreed that, in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, they would continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and that they would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerged that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals. They also noted that their assessments would take into account a wide range of information, including readings on public health, labor market conditions, in- flation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments. Members affirmed that the Committee was strongly committed to returning in- flation to its 2 percent objective. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the fol- lowing domestic policy directive, for release at 2:00 p.m.: “Effective September 22, 2022, the Federal Open Market Committee directs the Desk to:  Undertake open market operations as nec- essary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of 3 to 3¼ percent.  Conduct overnight repurchase agreement operations with a minimum bid rate of 3.25 percent and with an aggregate opera- tion limit of $500 billion; the aggregate op- eration limit can be temporarily increased at the discretion of the Chair.  Conduct overnight reverse repurchase agreement operations at an offering rate of 3.05 percent and with a per-counterparty Page 10 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ limit of $160 billion per day; the per-counterparty limit can be temporarily increased at the discretion of the Chair.  Roll over at auction the amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s hold- ings of Treasury securities maturing in each calendar month that exceeds a cap of $60 billion per month. Redeem Treasury coupon securities up to this monthly cap and Treasury bills to the extent that coupon principal payments are less than the monthly cap.  Reinvest into agency mortgage-backed se- curities (MBS) the amount of principal pay- ments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of agency debt and agency MBS received in each calendar month that exceeds a cap of $35 billion per month.  Allow modest deviations from stated amounts for reinvestments, if needed for operational reasons.  Engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settle- ment of the Federal Reserve’s agency MBS transactions.” The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below for release at 2:00 p.m.: “Recent indicators point to modest growth in spending and production. Job gains have been robust in recent months, and the unemploy- ment rate has remained low. Inflation remains elevated, reflecting supply and demand imbal- ances related to the pandemic, higher food and energy prices, and broader price pressures. Russia’s war against Ukraine is causing tremen- dous human and economic hardship. The war and related events are creating additional up- ward pressure on inflation and are weighing on global economic activity. The Committee is highly attentive to inflation risks. 6 In taking this action, the Board approved requests to estab- lish that rate submitted by the boards of directors of the Fed- eral Reserve Banks of Boston, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Rich- mond, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Kansas City, and Dallas. This vote also encompassed approval by the Board of Gover- nors of the establishment of a 3.25 percent primary credit rate by the remaining Federal Reserve Banks, effective on the later The Committee seeks to achieve maximum em- ployment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. In support of these goals, the Committee decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 3 to 3¼ percent and anticipates that ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate. In addition, the Com- mittee will continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities, as described in the Plans for Reducing the Size of the Federal Re- serve’s Balance Sheet that were issued in May. The Committee is strongly committed to re- turning inflation to its 2 percent objective. In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals. The Committee’s assessments will take into account a wide range of information, in- cluding readings on public health, labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation ex- pectations, and financial and international de- velopments.” Voting for this action: Jerome H. Powell, John C. Williams, Michael S. Barr, Michelle W. Bowman, Lael Brainard, James Bullard, Susan M. Collins, Lisa D. Cook, Esther L. George, Philip N. Jefferson, Loretta J. Mester, and Christopher J. Waller. Voting against this action: None. To support the Committee’s decision to raise the target range for the federal funds rate, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted unanimously to raise the interest rate paid on reserve balances to 3.15 percent, effective September 22, 2022. The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted unanimously to approve a ¾ percentage point increase in the primary credit rate to 3.25 percent, effective Sep- tember 22, 2022.6 of September 22, 2022, or the date such Reserve Banks inform the Secretary of the Board of such a request.

There was agreement that the Federal Re- serve can be effective only when there is a foundation of public trust. Participants reaffirmed the importance of holding themselves and their staffs accountable for knowing and following the high ethical standards that are set in the Committee’s policies, including those on financial transactions and disclosure and on external communications. Developments in Financial Markets and Open Market Operations The manager pro tem turned first to a discussion of fi- nancial market developments in the United States. Over Page 2 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ the period, financial conditions had tightened amid ele- vated volatility across financial markets. The market-im- plied path of the policy rate rose, with the median federal funds rate values in the September Summary of Eco- nomic Projections and other Federal Reserve communi- cations being viewed by market participants as indicating a commitment to sustaining a restrictive monetary policy stance. With data received over the period also indicat- ing higher-than-expected core inflation, market partici- pants placed high odds on a 75 basis point increase in the target range at the current meeting. Nonetheless, contacts were increasingly focused on the question of when the Committee might slow the pace of future in- creases in light of the substantial tightening of financial conditions that had occurred over the year. Most re- spondents to the Open Market Desk’s surveys viewed a 50 basis point increase in the target range for the federal funds rate at the December meeting as the most likely outcome. On net, nominal Treasury yields ended the period higher, reflecting both an upward revision in the expected path of the policy rate and higher estimated term premiums. Investment-grade bond yields and mortgage interest rates moved up as well, to the highest levels in many years. The manager pro tem turned next to a discussion of vol- atility in global financial markets. In September, an ex- pansionary budget announced by the U.K. government resulted in an extraordinary rise in yields on gilts (long- dated U.K. government securities) and reduced gilt mar- ket liquidity. Reflecting its financial stability objective, the Bank of England initiated a temporary gilt purchase program designed to address disorderly market condi- tions. These purchases and a subsequent cancellation of some announced expansionary U.K. budgetary measures resulted in a retracement of much of the earlier increase in gilt yields. Elevated volatility in international financial markets con- tributed to volatility in U.S. core fixed-income markets. In markets for U.S. Treasury securities, some measures of market-implied volatility approached pandemic-era levels. Spreads of yields on agency mortgage-backed se- curities (MBS) over yields on Treasury securities wid- ened sharply, reflecting the sensitivity of these spreads to increased volatility. The increased volatility appeared to contribute to a decline in measures of market liquidity in core fixed-income markets, in particular around the period associated with U.K. volatility, but market func- tioning remained orderly. The foreign exchange value of the dollar appreciated fur- ther over the period. Market participants perceived sev- eral Asian economies as engaging in foreign exchange market interventions in response to rapid depreciations of local currencies. In the case of advanced economies, whose monetary policy tightening was well under way, market participants focused on communications per- ceived as signaling a potentially slower pace of policy rate increases in the period ahead. The manager pro tem turned next to developments in money markets and Federal Reserve operations. Usage of the overnight reverse repurchase agreement (ON RRP) facility remained fairly steady other than dur- ing the period surrounding quarter-end. In the period ahead, the relative pace of decline in ON RRP facility balances and reserve balances would depend importantly on shifts in money market conditions. Recent develop- ments, including with regard to the relationship between ON RRP facility balances and money market rates, sug- gested that, over time, conditions could evolve in a man- ner that would lead to falling usage of the ON RRP fa- cility. However, the manager pro tem noted that money market conditions could change somewhat more quickly in the lead-up to year-end because of normal factors, such as a Treasury tax payment date in December that could increase the Treasury General Account balance, and year-end position adjustments. This prospect could require money market participants to be more respon- sive to shifting liquidity conditions and to plan ahead for the coming period. Current market quotes suggested ex- pectations of limited upward pressure on domestic money market rates around year-end. In offshore dollar funding markets, the premium associated with borrow- ing dollars was modestly higher than at similar points in previous years. Regarding Federal Reserve net income, 11 Reserve Banks reported deferred assets totaling $6.3 billion in the latest H.4.1 statistical release, reflect- ing the negative net income stemming from rising inter- est expense. Many other central banks also faced nega- tive net income. By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk’s domestic transactions over the intermeeting period. There were no intervention operations in foreign curren- cies for the System’s account during the intermeeting pe- riod. Staff Review of the Economic Situation The information available at the time of the Novem- ber 1–2 meeting suggested that U.S. real gross domestic product (GDP) had increased at a moderate pace in the third quarter after having declined over the first half of _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Minutes of the Meeting of November 1–2, 2022 Page 3 the year. Labor market conditions remained quite tight, and consumer price inflation—as measured by the 12-month percentage change in the price index for per- sonal consumption expenditures (PCE)—remained ele- vated. In September, total nonfarm payroll employment posted a solid gain that was somewhat slower than the pace seen in recent months, and the unemployment rate declined 0.2 percentage point to 3.5 percent. The unemployment rate for African Americans declined in September but was more than 2 percentage points above the national average; the unemployment rate for Hispanics declined to a level that was 0.3 percentage point above the na- tional measure. The labor force participation rate edged down in September, and the employment-to-population ratio was unchanged. The private-sector job openings rate, as measured by the Job Openings and Labor Turn- over Survey, moved lower, on net, from July to Septem- ber but remained high. Nominal wage growth continued to be rapid: Average hourly earnings rose 5.0 percent over the 12 months ending in September, while the em- ployment cost index (ECI) of hourly compensation in the private sector, which also includes benefit costs, rose 5.2 percent over this period. However, the three-month change in the ECI in September was noticeably lower than the average pace seen over the first half of the year. Consumer price inflation remained elevated. Total PCE price inflation was 6.2 percent over the 12 months end- ing in September, and core PCE inflation, which ex- cludes changes in consumer energy prices and many consumer food prices, was 5.1 percent over the same pe- riod. The trimmed mean measure of 12-month PCE price inflation constructed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas was 4.7 percent in September. The staff’s common inflation expectations index, which combines information from many indicators of inflation expecta- tions and inflation compensation, was little changed in the third quarter but remained above pre-pandemic lev- els. Real PCE rose modestly in the third quarter. Residential investment dropped further, however, and business fixed investment growth was held back by a decline in nonresidential structures investment. Government pur- chases rose in the third quarter after having declined over the first half of the year. The nominal U.S. international trade deficit narrowed in the third quarter. Net exports contributed positively to real GDP growth, as real exports stepped up while real imports declined. Data pointed to weakening foreign economic activity in recent months, weighed down by the economic fallout of Russia’s war against Ukraine, headwinds in China, and tighter financial conditions. In many advanced foreign economies, high inflation and disruptions to energy sup- ply contributed to a decline in real disposable incomes and depressed consumer and business confidence. In response, fiscal authorities in Europe and Japan an- nounced packages intended to ease the burden of high inflation on consumers and businesses. In China, data indicated weaker momentum in economic activity and a further deterioration in the property market. Weaker global demand has also resulted in a pronounced slow- down in manufacturing, which weighed on activity in ex- port-oriented emerging market economies in Asia. Con- sumer price inflation rose further in October in many foreign economies, reflecting past increases in energy and food prices, but also a continued broadening of in- flationary pressure within core prices. In response to high inflation, many central banks further tightened monetary policy, albeit at a slower pace in some cases. Staff Review of the Financial Situation Over the intermeeting period, U.S. Treasury yields and the market-implied federal funds rate path moved sub- stantially higher. Broad domestic equity prices were little changed, on net, amid high market volatility, while cor- porate bond yields increased notably. The rise in bor- rowing costs appeared to have slowed the volume of fi- nancing in many credit markets. Credit quality remained sound overall, although there are some signs of deterio- ration for lower-rated borrowers. The expected path of the federal funds rate implied by a straight read of financial market quotes rose notably over the intermeeting period, largely reflecting more-re- strictive-than-expected monetary policy communica- tions and data releases that pointed to inflation moving down more slowly than previously expected. On net, nominal Treasury yields increased across the maturity spectrum. The increases in nominal yields at medium- and longer-term horizons were primarily accounted for by higher real yields, though inflation compensation measures rose as well. Broad equity price indexes fell significantly early in the intermeeting period, with inflation news and monetary policy expectations likely being the main drivers of stock price movements. However, equity prices later re- bounded and ended the period essentially unchanged on net. One-month option-implied volatility on the S&P 500—the VIX—declined slightly, on net, but re- mained at the upper end of its range since mid-2020. Page 4 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Conditions in short-term funding markets remained sta- ble over the intermeeting period, with the September in- crease in the target range for the federal funds rate and the associated increases in the Federal Reserve’s admin- istered rates passing through quickly to overnight money market rates. In secured markets, money market rates remained soft relative to the ON RRP offering rate, at- tributed to subdued Treasury bill supply, elevated de- mand for Treasury collateral, and investor demand for very short-term assets amid uncertainty over the pace of policy rate increases. Daily take-up in the ON RRP fa- cility remained elevated amid this softness in repurchase agreement rates. Money market fund net yields rose along with the rise in administered rates, while retail bank deposit rates increased modestly on balance. Foreign asset prices were volatile over the intermeeting period as investors grappled with the combination of a deteriorating global growth outlook and synchronous policy tightening undertaken by major central banks in response to high inflation. Fiscal and political develop- ments in the United Kingdom added to market volatility but left little net imprint. On balance, sovereign bond yields in most advanced foreign economies rose mod- estly and equity prices were mixed. The U.S. dollar ap- preciated against most major currencies, driven by wid- ening yield differentials between the United States and the rest of the world and further deterioration of the for- eign growth outlook. The Japanese yen weakened against the dollar, on net, even though Japanese author- ities intervened to support the yen. The Chinese renminbi depreciated significantly against the dollar as continuation of the zero-COVID policy and increased investor concerns about longer-term growth prospects weighed on the currency. Investors continued to with- draw from dedicated emerging market economy and Eu- ropean funds amid further increases in U.S. Treasury yields and concerns over foreign economic growth. In domestic credit markets, borrowing costs continued to rise over the intermeeting period. Yields for corpo- rate bonds and institutional leveraged loans increased. Bank interest rates for commercial and industrial (C&I) loans continued the upward trend observed since the first quarter of 2022, while a rising proportion of small businesses reported facing increased borrowing costs in September. Municipal bond yields increased across rat- ings categories. Residential mortgage rates rose further in the period following the September FOMC meeting, nearly reaching their highest levels since 2002. Interest rates on existing credit card accounts continued to trend upward, reflecting increases in the federal funds rate that were quickly passed through to prime rates. Credit continued to be generally available to businesses and households despite some signs of tightening lending standards in certain segments, but high borrowing costs reduced the demand for credit in many markets. Issu- ance of corporate bonds, although quite strong in early September, slowed significantly in late September and October. Gross institutional leveraged loan issuance de- clined in September. Equity issuance and gross issuance of municipal bonds remained weak in September and October. Business loans at banks continued to expand in Septem- ber but at a slower pace than observed in past months. In the October Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices (SLOOS), banks reported hav- ing tightened C&I and commercial real estate (CRE) lending standards over the previous three months. Meanwhile, issuance of commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) also slowed amid higher spreads. Credit appeared to remain generally available to most small businesses, though the share of small firms report- ing that it was more difficult to obtain loans than three months ago continued its upward trend in September. Credit remained available in the residential mortgage market for borrowers who are able to pay high interest rates. The number of home-purchase and refinance mortgage originations were about flat in August and September but down significantly from late last year. Consumer credit remained available for most borrowers in July and August, with auto credit and credit card credit growing at a robust pace. However, banks in the Octo- ber SLOOS reported being less likely to approve auto and credit card loans to subprime and near-prime bor- rowers compared with earlier this year. The credit quality of nonfinancial corporations showed signs of deterioration in some sectors but remained gen- erally solid overall. The volume of corporate bond rat- ing upgrades was roughly on par with that of down- grades in September. However, upgrades were concen- trated in the investment-grade segment; in the specula- tive-grade segment, downgrades outpaced upgrades, and market-implied expectations of defaults over the next year increased markedly. Default rates on corporate bonds and leveraged loans rose slightly from low levels. The credit quality of C&I and CRE loans on banks’ bal- ance sheets also remained sound. Delinquency rates for CRE loans in non-agency CMBS pools ticked up in Sep- tember, as did indicators of future payment stress. De- linquency rates on small business loans remained quite low, and the credit quality of municipal securities re- mained strong. _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Minutes of the Meeting of November 1–2, 2022 Page 5 The credit quality of most households also appeared to remain solid. Delinquencies on residential mortgage loans continued to trend down, and the share of mort- gages in foreclosure in August remained close to pre- pandemic levels. Available data through the second quarter indicated that credit card and auto credit delin- quency rates continued to rise; however, delinquencies for auto loans were near their pre-pandemic levels, and those for credit cards remained well below pre-pandemic levels. The staff provided an update on its assessment of the stability of the financial system. The staff noted that re- spondents to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s survey of near-term risks judged that economic, finan- cial, and geopolitical risks had risen across the globe. Amid this weaker outlook and higher interest rates, prices of risky assets generally fell, though real estate val- uations remained elevated. Household borrowing was moderate, and mortgage performance remained strong. Nonfinancial businesses’ leverage continued to decline, and interest coverage ratios continued to increase; how- ever, further increases in borrowing costs could pose risks to some borrowers’ ability to service their debts. In the financial sector, the results of this year’s stress test demonstrated that large banks remain resilient to a sub- stantial economic downturn, but there were indicators of elevated leverage at hedge funds and other nonbank financial institutions. Short-term funding markets con- tinued to have structural vulnerabilities. Funding risks at domestic banks remained low, but prime money mar- ket funds, other cash-investment vehicles, open-end mu- tual funds, and stablecoins all continued to be suscepti- ble to disruptive redemptions. Staff Economic Outlook The projection for U.S. economic activity prepared by the staff for the November FOMC meeting was weaker than the September forecast. Broad financial conditions were expected to be considerably more restrictive over the projection period than in September, reflecting both recent market moves and upward revisions to the staff’s assumptions regarding the future course of monetary policy based on recent Federal Reserve communications. As a result, output was expected to move below the staff’s estimate of potential early in 2024 and to remain below potential in 2025. Likewise, the unemployment rate was expected to be above the staff’s estimate of its natural rate in 2024 and 2025. On a 12-month change basis, total PCE price inflation was expected to be 5.3 percent in 2022 and core inflation was expected to be 4.6 percent. The staff raised their projection for core PCE price inflation in coming quar- ters, reflecting their assessment that the factors that had boosted inflation since the middle of last year—most notably, strong wage growth and the effect of supply constraints on prices—would persist for longer than previously thought. With the effects of supply–demand imbalances in goods markets expected to unwind and la- bor and product markets expected to become less tight, the staff continued to project that inflation would de- cline markedly over the next two years; in 2025, both to- tal and core PCE price inflation were expected to be 2 percent. With inflation remaining stubbornly high, the staff con- tinued to view the risks to the inflation projection as skewed to the upside. For real activity, sluggish growth in real private domestic spending, a deteriorating global outlook, and tightening financial conditions were all seen as salient downside risks to the projection for real activ- ity; in addition, the possibility that a persistent reduction in inflation could require a greater-than-assumed amount of tightening in financial conditions was seen as another downside risk. The staff, therefore, continued to judge that the risks to the baseline projection for real activity were skewed to the downside and viewed the possibility that the economy would enter a recession sometime over the next year as almost as likely as the baseline. Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook In their discussion of current economic conditions, par- ticipants noted that recent indicators pointed to modest growth of spending and production. Nonetheless, job gains had been robust in recent months, and the unem- ployment rate had remained low. Inflation remained el- evated, reflecting supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic, higher food and energy prices, and broader price pressures. Participants recognized that Russia’s war against Ukraine was causing tremendous human and economic hardship. The war and related events were creating additional upward pressure on in- flation and were weighing on global economic activity. Against this background, participants continued to be highly attentive to inflation risks. With regard to current economic activity and the near- term outlook, participants observed that although real GDP rebounded in the third quarter, recent data sug- gested that economic activity in the near term appeared likely to expand at a pace below its trend growth rate. Participants noted a softening in consumer and business spending growth, and some participants remarked that Page 6 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ there had been a notable slowing in interest rate-sensi- tive sectors, particularly housing, in response to the tightening of financial conditions associated with the Committee’s policy actions. With inflation remaining far too high and showing few signs of moderating, partici- pants observed that a period of below-trend real GDP growth would be helpful in bringing aggregate supply and aggregate demand into better balance, reducing in- flationary pressures, and setting the stage for the sus- tained achievement of the Committee’s objectives of maximum employment and price stability. In their discussion of the household sector, participants noted that growth in consumer spending had softened recently. Several participants remarked that there had been a reduction in discretionary expenditures, especially among lower- and middle-income households, whose purchases were shifting toward lower-cost options. Par- ticipants observed that, in aggregate, household-sector balance sheets were still strong and that this factor would continue to support consumer spending. A few partici- pants noted that some households had been running down the additional savings they had accumulated dur- ing the pandemic and that there were reports of a rise in the number of households experiencing financial strains. Participants commented that higher mortgage interest rates had notably restrained housing activity. With regard to the business sector, participants noted that growth in investment spending was modest. Several participants observed that business investment was be- ing weighed down by tighter financial conditions, al- though a few participants reported that some business contacts indicated that their investment spending had been resilient. Some participants mentioned reports re- ceived from business contacts of easing supply bottle- necks, reflected in declines in shipping costs and delivery times, although the reported extent of these improve- ments varied across contacts. A few participants re- marked that, in instances in which supply constraints had eased, their business contacts found it easier to plan production or had diminished needs to maintain precau- tionary inventories. A couple of participants noted that drought conditions in the Midwest were making some waterways, notably the Mississippi River System, less navigable. These conditions were creating new supply constraints and putting upward pressures on transporta- tion costs and prices for farm products. Participants observed that, with inflation elevated glob- ally, many central banks were tightening monetary policy simultaneously, contributing to an overall tightening of global financial conditions. Participants further noted that the overall tightening of global financial conditions, along with energy prices and other headwinds, was con- tributing to a slowdown in the growth rate of global real GDP. Participants remarked that the foreign economic slowdown, in combination with a strong U.S. dollar, was likely to weigh on the U.S. export sector, and several par- ticipants commented that there could be wider spillovers to the U.S. economy. Participants observed that the labor market had re- mained very tight, with the unemployment rate near a historically low level, the number of job vacancies very high, a low pace of layoffs, robust employment gains, and elevated nominal wage growth. Some participants remarked that employers in certain sectors, such as health care, leisure and hospitality, or construction, faced particularly acute labor shortages and that these short- ages were contributing to especially strong wage pres- sures in those sectors. Participants commented on the labor market having remained strong to date, even alongside the slowing in economic activity. A number of participants remarked that some businesses were keen to retain workers after their recent experiences of labor shortages and hiring challenges. These participants noted that this consideration had limited layoffs even as the broader economy had softened or that this behavior could limit layoffs if aggregate economic activity were to soften further. Nevertheless, many participants noted tentative signs that the labor market might be moving slowly toward a better balance of supply and demand; these signs included a lower rate of job turnover and a moderation in nominal wage growth. Participants antic- ipated that imbalances in the labor market would gradu- ally diminish and that the unemployment rate would likely rise somewhat from its current very low level, while vacancies would likely fall. Participants agreed that inflation was unacceptably high and was well above the Committee’s longer-run goal of 2 percent. Some participants noted that the burden of high inflation was falling disproportionally on low-in- come households, for whom necessities like food, en- ergy, and shelter make up a larger share of expenditures. Many participants observed that price pressures had in- creased in the services sector and that, historically, price pressures in this sector had been more persistent than those in the goods sector. Some participants noted that the recent high pace of nominal wage growth, taken to- gether with the recent low pace of productivity growth, would, if sustained, be inconsistent with achievement of the 2 percent inflation objective. Several participants, however, commented on signs of a moderation in nom- _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Minutes of the Meeting of November 1–2, 2022 Page 7 inal wage growth. Participants agreed that near-term in- flation pressures were high, but some noted that lower commodity prices or the expected reduced pressure on goods prices due to an easing of supply constraints should contribute to lower inflation in the medium term. Several participants remarked that rent increases on new leases had been slowing in recent months, but partici- pants also noted that it would take some time for this development to show up in PCE inflation. Several par- ticipants summarized reports provided by business con- tacts about their firms’ ability to pass on higher input costs to their customers. These reports suggested that some firms continued to have solid pricing power, while in other cases cost pass-through had become more dif- ficult. Participants remarked that, overall, measures of me- dium- and longer-term inflation expectations obtained from surveys of households and businesses as well as from financial markets quotes appeared to have re- mained well anchored. A couple of participants ob- served that longer-term inflation expectations were sta- ble even as measures of near-term inflation expectations responded to realized inflation in line with historical pat- terns. Participants noted that longer-term inflation ex- pectations were an important influence on inflation’s be- havior and stressed that the Committee’s ongoing mon- etary policy tightening would be essential for ensuring that these expectations remained well anchored. Several participants expressed the concern that the longer infla- tion remained well above the 2 percent goal, the greater the risk that longer-term inflation expectations could be- come unanchored. Such a development, if it material- ized, would make it much more costly to bring inflation down and to achieve the Committee’s statutory objec- tives of maximum employment and price stability. A couple of participants discussed the high dispersion of longer-term inflation expectations across respondents in various surveys: These participants noted that the higher dispersion may signal increased uncertainty about the in- flation outlook and was a reason not to be complacent about longer-term inflation expectations remaining well anchored. Participants discussed the length of the lags in the re- sponse of the economy to monetary policy actions, tak- ing into account historical experience and the various es- timates of timing relationships provided in economic re- search, as well as the high degree of uncertainty involved in applying the evidence on lags to the current situation. They noted that monetary policy tightening typically produced rapid effects on financial conditions but that the full effects of changes in financial conditions on ag- gregate spending and the labor market, and then on in- flation, likely took longer to materialize. With regard to current circumstances, many participants remarked that, even though the tightening of monetary policy had clearly influenced financial conditions and had had no- table effects in some interest rate-sensitive sectors, the timing of the effects on overall economic activity, the labor market, and inflation was still quite uncertain, with the full extent of the effects yet to be realized. Several participants observed that, because of the difficulties in isolating the effects of monetary policy, changes in eco- nomic structure, or increasing transparency over time re- garding monetary policy decisions, the historical record did not provide definitive evidence on the length of these lags. In addition, some participants noted that the post-pandemic dynamics of the economy may differ from those prevailing prior to the pandemic. Participants generally noted that the uncertainty associ- ated with their economic outlooks was high and that the risks to the inflation outlook remained tilted to the up- side. Participants observed that recent inflation had been higher and more persistent than anticipated. Some participants noted the risk that energy prices could rise sharply again amid geopolitical tensions. A few partici- pants commented that the ongoing tightness in the labor market could lead to an emergence of a wage–price spi- ral, even though one had not yet developed. A number of participants judged that the risks regarding the outlook for economic activity were weighted to the downside, with various global headwinds being promi- nently cited. These global headwinds included a slow- down in economic activity occurring in China and the ongoing international economic implications of Russia’s war against Ukraine. Participants observed that, because of high inflation pressures prevailing globally, monetary policy tightening was under way in many other econo- mies—a development likely to affect foreign economic activity and carrying the potential for spillovers to the U.S. economy. In their discussion of issues related to financial stability, participants noted the importance of orderly functioning of the market for U.S. Treasury securities for the trans- mission of monetary policy, for meeting the financing needs of the federal government, and for the operation of the global financial system. Participants observed that, despite elevated interest rate volatility and indica- tions of strained liquidity conditions, the functioning of the Treasury securities market had been orderly. Noting that the value of resilience of the market for Treasury Page 8 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ securities was underlined by recent gilt market disrup- tions in the United Kingdom, a number of participants discussed a range of issues that could be considered by the appropriate authorities regarding market resilience, including potential interactions of capital and liquidity regulations with market activity, oversight of key market participants, clearing and settlement practices, and the role and structure of the Federal Reserve’s standing fa- cilities. A few participants noted the importance of be- ing prepared to address disruptions in U.S. core market functioning in ways that would not affect the stance of monetary policy, especially during episodes of monetary policy tightening. Several participants noted the risks posed by nonbank financial institutions amid the rapid global tightening of monetary policy and the potential for hidden leverage in these institutions to amplify shocks. In their consideration of appropriate monetary policy ac- tions at this meeting, participants concurred that infla- tion remained well above the Committee’s longer-run goal of 2 percent and the recent data on inflation pro- vided very few signs that inflation pressures were abat- ing. The economic expansion had slowed significantly from last year’s rapid pace, and recent indicators pointed to modest growth in spending and production in the cur- rent quarter. Despite the slowdown in growth, the labor market remained extremely tight, and nominal wage growth remained elevated. Against this backdrop, all participants agreed that it was appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate 75 basis points at this meeting and to continue the process of reducing the Federal Reserve’s securities holdings, as described in the Plans for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve’s Bal- ance Sheet that the Committee issued in May. Partici- pants observed that the policy rate hike at this meeting was another step toward making the Committee’s mon- etary policy stance sufficiently restrictive to help ease supply and demand imbalances and to return inflation to 2 percent over time. In their discussion of the effects of monetary policy ac- tions and communications to date, participants con- curred that the Committee had taken forceful steps to moderate aggregate demand in order to bring it into bet- ter alignment with aggregate supply. Financial condi- tions had tightened significantly in response to the Com- mittee’s policy actions, and their effects were clearly ev- ident in the most interest rate-sensitive sectors of the economy, including residential investment and some components of business investment. Several partici- pants commented that monetary policy actions and communications had helped keep longer-term inflation expectations well anchored—a situation that would help facilitate the return of inflation to the Committee’s longer-run goal of 2 percent. Nevertheless, with realized inflation well above that goal and the labor market still very tight, participants agreed that ongoing increases in the target range for the federal funds rate would be ap- propriate and would help keep longer-term inflation ex- pectations well anchored. Participants noted that, with regard to both real economic activity and inflation, it would take time for the full effects of monetary restraint to be realized and that these lags complicated an assess- ment of the effects of monetary policy. In discussing potential policy actions at upcoming meet- ings, participants reaffirmed their strong commitment to returning inflation to the Committee’s 2 percent objec- tive, and they continued to anticipate that ongoing in- creases in the target range for the federal funds rate would be appropriate in order to attain a sufficiently re- strictive stance of policy to bring inflation down over time. Many participants commented that there was sig- nificant uncertainty about the ultimate level of the fed- eral funds rate needed to achieve the Committee’s goals and that their assessment of that level would depend, in part, on incoming data. Even so, various participants noted that, with inflation showing little sign thus far of abating, and with supply and demand imbalances in the economy persisting, their assessment of the ultimate level of the federal funds rate that would be necessary to achieve the Committee’s goals was somewhat higher than they had previously expected. Participants mentioned a number of considerations that would likely influence the pace of future increases in the target range for the federal funds rate. These consider- ations included the cumulative tightening of monetary policy to date, the lags between monetary policy actions and the behavior of economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments. A number of participants observed that, as monetary policy ap- proached a stance that was sufficiently restrictive to achieve the Committee’s goals, it would become appro- priate to slow the pace of increase in the target range for the federal funds rate. In addition, a substantial majority of participants judged that a slowing in the pace of in- crease would likely soon be appropriate. A slower pace in these circumstances would better allow the Commit- tee to assess progress toward its goals of maximum em- ployment and price stability. The uncertain lags and magnitudes associated with the effects of monetary pol- icy actions on economic activity and inflation were among the reasons cited regarding why such an assess- ment was important. A few participants commented _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Minutes of the Meeting of November 1–2, 2022 Page 9 that slowing the pace of increase could reduce the risk of instability in the financial system. A few other partic- ipants noted that, before slowing the pace of policy rate increases, it could be advantageous to wait until the stance of policy was more clearly in restrictive territory and there were more concrete signs that inflation pres- sures were receding significantly. With monetary policy approaching a sufficiently restric- tive stance, participants emphasized that the level to which the Committee ultimately raised the target range for the federal funds rate, and the evolution of the policy stance thereafter, had become more important consider- ations for achieving the Committee’s goals than the pace of further increases in the target range. Participants agreed that communicating this distinction to the public was important in order to reinforce the Committee’s strong commitment to returning inflation to the 2 per- cent objective. Participants discussed a number of risk-management considerations related to the conduct of monetary pol- icy. In light of the continuing broad-based and unac- ceptably high level of inflation and upside risks to the inflation outlook, participants remarked that purpose- fully moving to a more restrictive policy stance was con- sistent with risk-management considerations. Some par- ticipants observed that there had been an increase in the risk that the cumulative policy restraint would exceed what was required to bring inflation back to 2 percent. Several participants commented that continued rapid policy tightening increased the risk of instability or dis- locations in the financial system. There was wide agree- ment that heightened uncertainty regarding the outlooks for both inflation and real activity underscored the im- portance of taking into account the cumulative tighten- ing of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affected economic activity and inflation, and eco- nomic and financial developments. Committee Policy Action In their discussion of monetary policy for this meeting, members agreed that recent indicators had pointed to modest growth in spending and production. Members also concurred that job gains had been robust in recent months, and the unemployment rate had remained low. Members agreed that inflation had remained elevated, reflecting supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic, higher food and energy prices, and broader price pressures. Members observed that Russia’s war against Ukraine was causing tremendous human and economic hardship. They also agreed that the war and related events were creating additional upward pressure on inflation and were weighing on global economic activity. Members concurred that they remained highly attentive to infla- tion risks. Members agreed that the Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 per- cent over the longer run. In support of these goals, members agreed to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 3¾ to 4 percent. Members anticipated that ongoing increases in the target range would be appropri- ate in order to attain a stance of monetary policy suffi- ciently restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent over time. Members agreed to add language to this effect in the postmeeting statement, on the grounds that this would underscore the Committee’s view that a suffi- ciently restrictive stance of monetary policy was needed for achieving its dual-mandate goals. Members agreed that, in determining the pace of future increases in the target range, they would take into account the cumula- tive tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affected economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments. Members agreed to add language to this effect in the postmeeting statement in order to convey explicitly the range of fac- tors that they would consider in determining future monetary policy actions. In addition, members agreed that they would continue reducing the Federal Reserve’s holdings of Treasury securities, agency debt, and agency MBS, as described in the Plans for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve’s Balance Sheet that were issued in May. All members affirmed that they were strongly committed to returning inflation to its 2 percent objec- tive. Members agreed that, in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, they would continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. They would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerged that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals. Members agreed that their assessments will take into ac- count a wide range of information, including readings on public health, labor market conditions, inflation pres- sures and inflation expectations, and financial and inter- national developments. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the fol- lowing domestic policy directive, for release at 2:00 p.m.: Page 10 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ “Effective November 3, 2022, the Federal Open Market Committee directs the Desk to: • Undertake open market operations as nec- essary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of 3¾ to 4 percent. • Conduct overnight repurchase agreement operations with a minimum bid rate of 4 percent and with an aggregate operation limit of $500 billion; the aggregate opera- tion limit can be temporarily increased at the discretion of the Chair. • Conduct overnight reverse repurchase agreement operations at an offering rate of 3.8 percent and with a per-counterparty limit of $160 billion per day; the per-coun- terparty limit can be temporarily increased at the discretion of the Chair. • Roll over at auction the amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s hold- ings of Treasury securities maturing in each calendar month that exceeds a cap of $60 billion per month. Redeem Treasury coupon securities up to this monthly cap and Treasury bills to the extent that coupon principal payments are less than the monthly cap. • Reinvest into agency mortgage-backed se- curities (MBS) the amount of principal pay- ments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of agency debt and agency MBS received in each calendar month that exceeds a cap of $35 billion per month. • Allow modest deviations from stated amounts for reinvestments, if needed for operational reasons. • Engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settle- ment of the Federal Reserve’s agency MBS transactions.” The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below for release at 2:00 p.m.: “Recent indicators point to modest growth in spending and production. Job gains have been robust in recent months, and the unemploy- ment rate has remained low. Inflation remains elevated, reflecting supply and demand imbal- ances related to the pandemic, higher food and energy prices, and broader price pressures. Russia’s war against Ukraine is causing tremen- dous human and economic hardship. The war and related events are creating additional up- ward pressure on inflation and are weighing on global economic activity. The Committee is highly attentive to inflation risks. The Committee seeks to achieve maximum em- ployment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. In support of these goals, the Committee decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 3¾ to 4 percent. The Committee anticipates that ongoing in- creases in the target range will be appropriate in order to attain a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent over time. In determining the pace of future increases in the target range, the Com- mittee will take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial devel- opments. In addition, the Committee will con- tinue reducing its holdings of Treasury securi- ties and agency debt and agency mortgage- backed securities, as described in the Plans for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve’s Bal- ance Sheet that were issued in May. The Com- mittee is strongly committed to returning infla- tion to its 2 percent objective. In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals. The Committee’s assessments will take into account a wide range of information, in- cluding readings on public health, labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation ex- pectations, and financial and international de- velopments.” Voting for this action: Jerome H.

Developments in Financial Markets and Open Market Operations The manager pro tem turned first to a discussion of de- velopments in financial markets. Following several months of tightening, financial conditions eased over the period as investor concerns about global risks edged lower and incoming data showed nascent signs of a moderation in inflationary pressures. Central bank com- munications signaling a slower pace of policy rate in- creases appeared to contribute to improved sentiment. Measures of implied volatility across financial markets declined somewhat from the elevated levels observed in October. Consistent with the decline in volatility, model-based measures suggested that a drop in term premiums accounted for much of the decline in Treasury yields over the period. Equity markets moved higher. However, equity market contacts noted risks to growth ahead, and earnings expectations for coming quarters had been marked down. In foreign exchange markets, moderating concerns about the potential for highly ele- vated U.S. interest rates spurred a depreciation in the foreign exchange value of the dollar. In other market developments, the manager pro tem noted the failure of a prominent crypto-asset exchange. While the spillovers from this situation had been significant among other crypto lenders and exchanges, the collapse was not seen as posing broader market risks to the financial system. Regarding the outlook for inflation in the United States, inflation compensation implied by Treasury Inflation Protected Securities declined over the period, respond- ing to lower-than-expected consumer price index (CPI) data and a sizable drop in oil prices. However, the Desk survey-based measures of inflation expectations were lit- tle changed from the prior survey, suggesting that falling inflation risk premiums may have contributed to the moves. Both market- and survey-based measures con- tinued to point to expectations for a moderation of in- flation over the coming year. Regarding the outlook for monetary policy, both mar- ket- and Desk survey-based measures indicated expecta- tions for the Committee to maintain elevated policy rates through 2023. In the December survey, the median re- spondent’s modal expectation for the path of the federal funds rate in 2023 shifted higher by 25 basis points rela- tive to the November survey. The survey-based estimate of the expected policy path in 2024 continued to suggest a decline in the target range for the federal funds rate over 2024, little changed from the path anticipated in the November survey. In contrast, the market-implied path of the federal funds rate in 2024 shifted down by as much as ¾ percentage point over the period, likely re- flecting declining risk premiums. The manager pro tem turned next to a discussion of op- erations and money markets and assessed that balance sheet runoff was proceeding smoothly. Repurchase agreement (repo) rates firmed modestly relative to the overnight reverse repurchase agreement (ON RRP) fa- cility rate over the period with balance sheet reduction reportedly contributing, in part, to an increase in the de- mand for financing of Treasury securities. ON RRP bal- ances declined, on net, as money market funds shifted investments out of the ON RRP facility, reportedly in favor of higher rates available in repo markets. In recent months, banks continued to increase their use of wholesale funding. In addition, survey information suggested that banks expected to move deposit rates modestly higher relative to the target range in coming months. Over time, greater competition among banks for funding could contribute to drawdowns in the ON RRP facility. Staff indicated that they would con- tinue to monitor money market conditions closely as bal- ance sheet reduction proceeds. Looking ahead to year end, market participants antici- pated limited pressures. The manager pro tem noted that if transitory pressures emerged in money markets, the Federal Reserve’s backstop facilities are available to support effective policy implementation and smooth market functioning. By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk’s domestic transactions over the intermeeting period. There were no intervention operations in foreign curren- cies for the System’s account during the intermeeting pe- riod. Minutes of the Meeting of December 13–14, 2022 Page 3 _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Staff Review of the Economic Situation The information available at the time of the Decem- ber 13–14 meeting suggested that U.S. real gross domes- tic product (GDP) was increasing at a modest pace in the fourth quarter of 2022 after expanding strongly in the third quarter. Labor market conditions eased some- what over October and November but remained quite tight. Consumer price inflation—as measured by the 12-month percent change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE)—stepped down in October but continued to be elevated. Total nonfarm payroll employment posted solid gains in October and November that were slower than the aver- age monthly pace seen over the earlier part of the year. The unemployment rate moved up 0.2 percentage point to 3.7 percent in October and remained at that rate in November. On balance, the unemployment rate for Af- rican Americans edged down over those two months, while the unemployment rate for Hispanics increased slightly; the unemployment rates for both groups re- mained above the national measure. Both the labor force participation rate and the employment-to- population ratio declined a little over the past two months. The private-sector job openings rate, as meas- ured by the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, moved back down in October but remained high. Nominal wage growth continued to be elevated and re- mained above the pace judged to be consistent with the FOMC’s 2 percent inflation objective. Average hourly earnings rose 5.1 percent over the 12 months ending in November, close to the pace recorded in the employ- ment cost index of hourly compensation in the private sector over the 12 months ending in September. Com- pensation per hour (CPH) in the business sector rose 4.0 percent over the four quarters ending in the third quarter, but the reported increase likely understated the true pace of increase in CPH, as the lower second-quar- ter employment data from the Quarterly Census of Em- ployment and Wages had not yet been incorporated in the CPH measure. Consumer price inflation remained elevated but had eased in recent months. Total PCE price inflation was 6.0 percent over the 12 months ending in October, 0.3 percentage point below the September figure. Core PCE price inflation, which excludes changes in con- sumer energy prices and many consumer food prices, was 5.0 percent over the 12 months ending in October, down 0.2 percentage point from its September reading. The trimmed mean measure of 12-month PCE price in- flation constructed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dal- las remained at 4.7 percent in October. In November, the 12-month change in the CPI stepped down to 7.1 percent and core CPI inflation dropped to 6.0 per- cent. The CPI, along with data from the producer price index, pointed to a further slowing in PCE price inflation in November. A preliminary estimate of the staff’s com- mon inflation expectations index, which combines infor- mation from many indicators of inflation expectations and inflation compensation, edged down in the fourth quarter but continued to be above pre-pandemic levels. After expanding at a moderate pace in the third quarter, real PCE growth appeared to have picked up in the fourth quarter. In contrast, residential investment looked to be contracting sharply further, and growth in business fixed investment seemed to be slowing mark- edly, with tepid gains in equipment and intangibles spending and continued declines in nonresidential struc- tures investment. Manufacturing production increased only modestly in October, and the available data pointed to a decline in November. A decrease in factory output would be consistent with recent readings from national and regional manufacturing surveys, which showed de- clining new orders and a drawdown in order backlogs. After narrowing in the third quarter, the nominal U.S. international trade deficit widened in October. Real goods exports fell, led by declines in exports of industrial supplies and consumer goods. Real goods imports rose, driven by increases in imports of industrial supplies, which more than offset declines in imports of capital goods and consumer goods. Exports of services rose, in part as travel exports continued to recover, while im- ports of services were little changed. Foreign economic activity grew at a moderate pace in the third quarter, but more recent data pointed to weakening growth, weighed down by the economic fallout of Rus- sia’s war against Ukraine and a COVID-19-related slow- down in China. High inflation continued to contribute to a decline in real disposable incomes, which, together with disruptions to energy supplies, depressed economic activity, especially in Europe. In China, authorities be- gan to ease social restrictions even as COVID cases surged, raising the prospect of significant disruptions to economic activity in the near term, but also a faster reo- pening. Weaker global demand and high interest rates also weighed on activity in emerging market economies. Despite tentative signs of easing in foreign headline in- flation, core inflationary pressures remained elevated in Page 4 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ many countries. In response to high inflation, many cen- tral banks further tightened monetary policy, albeit at a slower pace in some cases. Staff Review of the Financial Situation Over the intermeeting period, Treasury yields and measures of inflation compensation declined, on net, and the implied path of the federal funds rate in 2023 ended modestly lower. Stock market indexes rose, on balance, likely reflecting reduced concerns about the in- flation outlook, and market volatility declined notably. Borrowing costs declined, on net, over the intermeeting period. Credit flows moderated a bit in recent months, and the credit quality of businesses and most households remained solid. The expected path of the federal funds rate implied by a straight read of financial market quotes ended the inter- meeting period lower, largely reflecting data releases that pointed to a larger-than-expected moderation in infla- tion. Medium-to-longer-term nominal Treasury yields declined substantially over the intermeeting period, driven primarily by lower-than-expected inflation data releases, which appeared to prompt a substantial reduc- tion in investors’ concerns about the possibility that in- flation would remain high for a long period. In line with those developments, inflation compensation measures based on inflation swaps declined notably, especially for shorter maturities. Broad stock price indexes increased, likely reflecting re- duced concerns about the inflation outlook and the as- sociated implications for the future path of policy. On net, the one-month option-implied volatility on the S&P 500—the VIX—decreased notably and was around the middle of its range since mid-2020. In line with re- duced investor concerns about the inflation outlook, spreads of interest rates on corporate debt, mortgage- backed securities, and municipal bonds to comparable- duration Treasury yields all narrowed over the intermeet- ing period. Conditions in short-term funding markets remained sta- ble over the intermeeting period, with the November in- crease in the target range for the federal funds rate and the associated increases in the Federal Reserve’s admin- istered rates passing through quickly to overnight money market rates. In secured markets, repo rates were below the ON RRP offering rate less frequently than in the pre- vious intermeeting period. Daily take-up in the ON RRP facility declined modestly, consistent with the recent firming in overnight repo rates. Net yields on money market funds rose further over the intermeeting period, mostly passing through the increase in adminis- tered rates, while bank deposit rates increased only slightly in October and November. Foreign financial conditions broadly eased over the in- termeeting period, largely driven by lower-than-expected U.S. inflation data. The foreign exchange value of the dollar depreciated against most foreign currencies, par- ticularly against those of advanced foreign economies, in part reflecting a narrowing of near-term yield differen- tials between the United States and other advanced economies. Investors reacted positively to news of an easing of COVID restrictions in China, which drove risky asset prices significantly higher despite near-term challenges associated with the health policy shift. Emerging market fund outflows moderated and turned to inflows later in the intermeeting period. Option- implied volatility measures for exchange rates and benchmark foreign yields declined but remained ele- vated by historical norms amid a high degree of uncer- tainty around global inflation and the prospects for a re- opening of the Chinese economy. In domestic credit markets, changes in borrowing costs were mixed during the intermeeting period but remained above levels observed at the end of the previous tight- ening cycle. Yields for corporate bonds declined, while borrowing costs for leveraged loans remained at an ele- vated level. Bank interest rates for commercial and in- dustrial (C&I) loans continued to trend up in the third quarter. Municipal bond yields also decreased across rat- ing categories. Residential mortgage rates fell, on net, after the November FOMC meeting. In contrast, inter- est rates in credit card offers continued to increase, re- flecting the higher prime rate that was quickly passed through. Interest rates on auto loans also rose steadily through November. Credit continued to be generally available to businesses and households, but high borrowing costs appeared to weigh on financing volumes in many markets. Issuance of investment-grade corporate bonds rebounded some- what in late October and November from earlier sub- dued levels, while speculative-grade issuance remained soft. New launches of leveraged loans picked up in No- vember, particularly for higher-rated firms. Business loan originations continued to expand in Octo- ber and November but at a slower pace than observed in previous months. C&I loans continued to grow in October and November but decelerated relative to the third-quarter pace, moderating the robust rate of growth observed earlier this year. Nonetheless, the volume of Minutes of the Meeting of December 13–14, 2022 Page 5 _____________________________________________________________________________________________ C&I lending remained solid overall. Commercial real es- tate (CRE) loans outstanding at commercial banks con- tinued to increase in October and November, but the recent pace was somewhat lower than in previous months. In addition, banks increased CRE originations to multifamily and industrial properties relative to office properties, reflecting caution in the context of rising of- fice vacancies. Moreover, commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) issuance softened somewhat in Octo- ber amid elevated financing costs and tighter underwrit- ing standards. Credit availability to small businesses ap- peared to have tightened further this fall, with the share of small firms reporting that it was more difficult to ob- tain credit than three months earlier trending up through November. Credit was readily available in the residential mortgage market for high-credit-score borrowers who met stand- ard conforming loan criteria. Credit availability for households with lower credit scores was considerably tighter at levels comparable with what prevailed before the pandemic. The number of home purchases and re- finance mortgage rate locks edged lower at subdued lev- els despite recent declines in mortgage interest rates. In contrast, home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) grew notably in recent months, on net, potentially reflecting homeowners using HELOCs as a preferred way of ex- tracting home equity in the presence of high mortgage rates. Consumer credit remained available for most con- sumers through September, with auto loans and credit card debt growing at a robust pace. Bank credit data also indicate that the expansion in credit card balances con- tinued in October before slowing in early November. The credit quality of nonfinancial corporations remained solid. The volume of speculative-grade corporate bond downgrades slightly exceeded upgrades in October and November, while for investment-grade corporate bonds, the volume of upgrades turned positive, on net, in November. Leveraged loans experienced net down- grades in October, but the pace of net downgrades slowed substantially in recent weeks. Default rates on corporate bonds and leveraged loans remained at very low levels. However, measures of expected default probabilities for corporate bonds and leveraged loans had increased from their levels at the beginning of the year in recent months. Overall, the credit quality of mu- nicipalities remained robust amid strong revenues at state and local governments. The credit quality of busi- nesses that borrow from banks remained sound on bal- ance. Delinquencies on C&I loans stayed flat, and those on small businesses loans continued to edge up, but de- linquencies remained low relative to historical levels. In addition, the credit quality of non-agency CMBS loan borrowers deteriorated slightly, with average delin- quency rates ticking up in September and October, driven by the office and retail sectors. The credit quality of most households remained solid overall. Delinquencies on conventional mortgages con- tinued to trend down through October, while those on Federal Housing Administration mortgages ticked up a bit from low levels. In contrast, delinquency rates for credit cards and auto loans continued to rise over the third quarter. While delinquency rates on credit cards remained low relative to their historical range, those on auto loans surpassed their pre-pandemic peak. Staff Economic Outlook The forecast for U.S. economic activity prepared by the staff for the December FOMC meeting was not as weak as the November projection. Recent data suggested that real GDP growth in the second half of 2022 was stronger than previously expected, but economic growth was still forecast to slow markedly in 2023 from its sec- ond-half pace. Broad financial conditions were pro- jected to be somewhat less restrictive than previously as- sumed, as the effects of a higher path for equity values and a lower path for the dollar more than offset a higher medium-term trajectory for interest rates. Nevertheless, the forecast for U.S. real GDP growth through 2025 re- mained subdued. The staff slightly lowered its outlook for potential output, reflecting a lower expected trend in labor force participation. Moreover, the staff assumed a slower pace of decline in the natural rate of unemploy- ment over the near term in response to recent estimates suggesting that job-matching efficiency was not improv- ing as fast as previously anticipated. With all these changes, output was expected to move below the staff’s estimate of potential near the end of 2024—a year later than in the previous forecast—and to remain below po- tential in 2025. Likewise, the unemployment rate was expected to move above the staff’s estimate of its natural rate near the end of 2024 and remain above it in 2025. On a four-quarter change basis, total PCE price inflation was expected to be 5.5 percent in 2022, while core infla- tion was expected to be 4.7 percent, both lower than in the November projection. With the effects of supply– demand imbalances in goods markets expected to un- wind further and labor and product markets projected to become less tight, the staff continued to forecast that in- flation would decline markedly over the next two years. Core goods inflation was anticipated to slow further, housing services inflation was expected to peak in 2023 and then move down, while core non-housing services Page 6 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ inflation was forecast to move down as wage growth eased. In 2025, both total and core PCE price inflation were expected to be near 2 percent. With inflation still elevated, the staff continued to view the risks to the inflation projection as skewed to the up- side. Moreover, the sluggish growth in real private do- mestic spending expected over the next year, a subdued global economic outlook, and persistently tight financial conditions were seen as tilting the risks to the downside around the baseline projection for real economic activ- ity, and the staff still viewed the possibility of a recession sometime over the next year as a plausible alternative to the baseline. Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, participants submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and infla- tion for each year from 2022 through 2025 and over the longer run, based on their individual assessments of ap- propriate monetary policy, including the path of the fed- eral funds rate. The longer-run projections represented each participant’s assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, un- der appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy. A Summary of Eco- nomic Projections was released to the public following the conclusion of the meeting. In their discussion of current economic conditions, par- ticipants noted that recent indicators pointed to modest growth of spending and production. Nonetheless, job gains had been robust in recent months, and the unem- ployment rate had remained low. Inflation remained el- evated, reflecting supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic, higher food and energy prices, and broader price pressures. Participants recognized that Russia’s war against Ukraine was causing tremendous human and economic hardship. The war and related events were contributing to upward pressure on inflation and were weighing on global economic activity. Against this background, participants continued to be highly at- tentive to inflation risks. Participants observed that the growth of economic ac- tivity had slowed significantly in 2022 from the previous year’s robust pace, partly in response to the Committee’s policy actions. The effects of those actions were espe- cially notable in interest-sensitive sectors, particularly housing. Participants remarked that, although real GDP appeared to have rebounded moderately in the second half of 2022 after declining somewhat in the first half, economic activity appeared likely to expand in 2023 at a pace well below its trend growth rate. With inflation re- maining unacceptably high, participants expected that a sustained period of below-trend real GDP growth would be needed to bring aggregate supply and aggregate de- mand into better balance and thereby reduce inflationary pressures. In their discussion of the household sector, participants noted that growth in consumer spending in September and October had been stronger than they had previously expected, likely supported by a strong labor market and households running down excess savings accumulated during the pandemic. A couple of participants remarked that excess savings likely would continue to support con- sumption spending for a while. A couple of other par- ticipants, however, commented that excess savings, par- ticularly among low-income households, appeared to be lower and declining more rapidly than previously thought or that the savings, the majority of which ap- peared to be held by higher-income households, might continue to be largely unspent. Several participants re- marked that budgets were stretched for low-to-moder- ate-income households and that many consumers were shifting their spending to less expensive alternatives. They also observed that many households were increas- ingly using credit to finance spending. Overall, partici- pants assessed that there was considerable uncertainty around the consumer spending outlook. Participants commented that higher mortgage interest rates had no- tably restrained housing activity and that they expected housing activity to remain weak. A couple of partici- pants remarked on anecdotes or concerns from builder contacts about contract cancellations by purchasers no longer able to qualify for loans at higher interest rates. With regard to the business sector, participants noted that growth in investment spending appeared modest and was being restrained by high borrowing costs and an outlook for slow growth of final demand, although views on investment prospects varied across businesses and Districts. Based on discussions with District con- tacts as well as a survey of firms’ chief financial officers, some participants commented that while businesses were generally optimistic about their own prospects, they expressed increasing concern about the general eco- nomic outlook for 2023. Participants noted signs of continued easing in supply bottlenecks, with a couple cit- ing District contacts’ reports of declines in shipping costs and delivery times. Even so, participants remarked that the improvements in supply chains had not been uniform and supply shortages remained for some types of goods. Participants also discussed the developments Minutes of the Meeting of December 13–14, 2022 Page 7 _____________________________________________________________________________________________ in energy and agricultural sectors. Several participants commented that they saw diminished risks of severe dis- ruption from the European Union’s embargo and the Group of Seven’s price cap on Russian oil exports. A couple of participants noted that high costs for inputs like diesel, feed, and fertilizer were creating challenges for the agricultural sector. Participants observed that the labor market had re- mained very tight, with the unemployment rate near a historically low level, robust payroll gains, a high level of job vacancies, and elevated nominal wage growth. Sev- eral participants commented that there were tentative signs of labor market imbalances improving, including declines in job openings and quits over the second half of 2022 as well as reports from District contacts that they were seeing more qualified job applicants for open positions than earlier in the year. Some participants pointed out that payroll gains had remained robust even as they slowed in recent months. Nevertheless, they noted that some other measures of employment—such as those based on the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ house- hold survey and the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages—suggested that job growth in 2022 may have been weaker than indicated by payroll employment. Participants generally concluded that there remained a large imbalance between labor supply and labor demand, as indicated by the still-large number of job openings and elevated nominal wage growth. Participants com- mented that labor demand had remained strong to date despite the slowdown in economic growth, with a few remarking that some business contacts reported that they would be keen to retain workers even in the face of slowing demand for output because of their recent ex- periences of labor shortages and hiring challenges. With the labor force participation rate little changed since the beginning of 2022, some participants commented that labor supply appeared to be constrained by structural factors such as early retirements, reduced availability or increased cost of childcare, more costly transportation, and reduced immigration. Under an appropriately re- strictive path of monetary policy, participants expected labor market supply and demand to come into better bal- ance over time, easing upward pressures on nominal wages and prices. In the context of achieving the Com- mittee’s broad-based and inclusive maximum-employ- ment goal, a number of participants commented that as the labor market moved into better balance, the unem- ployment rate for some demographic groups—particu- larly African Americans and Hispanics—would likely in- crease by more than the national average. With inflation still well above the Committee’s longer- run goal of 2 percent, participants agreed that inflation was unacceptably high. Participants concurred that the inflation data received for October and November showed welcome reductions in the monthly pace of price increases, but they stressed that it would take sub- stantially more evidence of progress to be confident that inflation was on a sustained downward path. Partici- pants noted that core goods prices declined in the Octo- ber and November CPI data, consistent with easing sup- ply bottlenecks. Some participants also noted that, by some measures, firms’ markups were still elevated and that a continued subdued expansion in aggregate de- mand would likely be needed to reduce remaining up- ward pressure on inflation. Regarding housing services inflation, many participants observed that measures of rent based on new leases were indicating a deceleration, which would be reflected in the measures of shelter in- flation with some lag. Participants noted that, in the lat- est inflation data, the pace of increase for prices of core services excluding shelter—which represents the largest component of core PCE price inflation—was high. They also remarked that this component of inflation has tended to be closely linked to nominal wage growth and therefore would likely remain persistently elevated if the labor market remained very tight. Consequently, while there were few signs of adverse wage-price dynamics at present, they assessed that bringing down this compo- nent of inflation to mandate-consistent levels would re- quire some softening in the growth of labor demand to bring the labor market back into better balance. Participants observed that measures from surveys of households and businesses as well as from financial mar- kets generally indicated that longer-term inflation expec- tations remained well anchored, while short-term infla- tion expectations had come down. However, partici- pants stressed that the Committee’s ongoing monetary policy tightening to achieve a stance that will be suffi- ciently restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent is es- sential for ensuring that longer-term expectations re- main well anchored. Several participants commented that the longer inflation remained well above the 2 per- cent goal, the greater the risk that longer-term inflation expectations could become unanchored. Such a devel- opment, if it materialized, would make it much more costly to bring inflation down to achieve the Commit- tee’s statutory objectives of maximum employment and price stability. Participants noted that since the November meeting, fi- nancial conditions had eased, with the market-implied path for the federal funds rate beyond 2023 and longer- Page 8 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ term yields coming down noticeably. A few participants remarked that the current configuration of nominal yields, with longer-term yields lower than shorter-term yields, had historically preceded recessions and hence bore watching. However, a couple of them also noted that the current inversion of the yield curve could reflect, in part, that investors expect the nominal policy rate to decline because of a fall in inflation over time. Participants generally noted that the uncertainty associ- ated with their economic outlooks was high and that the risks to the inflation outlook remained tilted to the up- side. Participants cited the possibility that price pres- sures could prove to be more persistent than anticipated, due to, for example, the labor market staying tight for longer than anticipated. Participants saw a number of uncertainties surrounding the outlook for inflation stem- ming from factors abroad, such as China’s relaxation of its zero-COVID policies, Russia’s continuing war against Ukraine, and effects of synchronous policy firm- ing by major central banks. A number of participants judged that the risks to the outlook for economic activity were weighted to the downside. They noted that sources of such risks included the potential for more persistent inflation inducing more restrictive policy responses, the prospect of unexpected negative shocks tipping the economy into a recession in an environment of subdued growth, and the possibility of households’ and busi- nesses’ concerns about the outlook restraining their spending sufficiently to reduce aggregate output. In their consideration of appropriate monetary policy ac- tions at this meeting, participants concurred that the Committee had made significant progress over the past year in moving toward a sufficiently restrictive stance of monetary policy. Even so, participants agreed that infla- tion remained well above the Committee’s longer-run goal of 2 percent, while the labor market remained very tight, contributing to upward pressures on wages and prices. Against this backdrop, all participants agreed that it was appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate 50 basis points at this meeting and to continue the process of reducing the Federal Reserve’s securities holdings, as described in the Plans for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve’s Balance Sheet that the Commit- tee issued in May. Participants observed that a slowing in the pace of rate increases at this meeting would better allow the Committee to assess the economy’s progress toward the Committee’s goals of maximum employment and price stability, as monetary policy approached a stance that was sufficiently restrictive to achieve these goals. In discussing the policy outlook, participants continued to anticipate that ongoing increases in the target range for the federal funds rate would be appropriate to achieve the Committee’s objectives. In determining the pace of future increases in the target range, participants judged that it would be appropriate to take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments. With inflation staying persistently above the Commit- tee’s 2 percent goal and the labor market remaining very tight, all participants had raised their assessment of the appropriate path of the federal funds rate relative to their assessment at the time of the September meeting. No participants anticipated that it would be appropriate to begin reducing the federal funds rate target in 2023. Par- ticipants generally observed that a restrictive policy stance would need to be maintained until the incoming data provided confidence that inflation was on a sus- tained downward path to 2 percent, which was likely to take some time. In view of the persistent and unaccept- ably high level of inflation, several participants com- mented that historical experience cautioned against prematurely loosening monetary policy. In light of the heightened uncertainty regarding the out- looks for both inflation and real economic activity, most participants emphasized the need to retain flexibility and optionality when moving policy to a more restrictive stance. Participants generally noted that the Commit- tee’s future decisions regarding policy would continue to be informed by the incoming data and their implications for the outlook for economic activity and inflation, and that the Committee would continue to make decisions meeting by meeting. Participants reaffirmed their strong commitment to re- turning inflation to the Committee’s 2 percent objective. A number of participants emphasized that it would be important to clearly communicate that a slowing in the pace of rate increases was not an indication of any weak- ening of the Committee’s resolve to achieve its price- stability goal or a judgment that inflation was already on a persistent downward path. Participants noted that, be- cause monetary policy worked importantly through fi- nancial markets, an unwarranted easing in financial con- ditions, especially if driven by a misperception by the public of the Committee’s reaction function, would complicate the Committee’s effort to restore price sta- bility. Several participants commented that the medians of participants’ assessments for the appropriate path of the federal funds rate in the Summary of Economic Pro- jections, which tracked notably above market-based Minutes of the Meeting of December 13–14, 2022 Page 9 _____________________________________________________________________________________________ measures of policy rate expectations, underscored the Committee’s strong commitment to returning inflation to its 2 percent goal. Participants discussed a number of risk-management considerations related to the conduct of monetary pol- icy. Many participants highlighted that the Committee needed to continue to balance two risks. One risk was that an insufficiently restrictive monetary policy could cause inflation to remain above the Committee’s target for longer than anticipated, leading to unanchored infla- tion expectations and eroding the purchasing power of households, especially for those already facing difficulty making ends meet. The other risk was that the lagged cumulative effect of policy tightening could end up be- ing more restrictive than is necessary to bring down in- flation to 2 percent and lead to an unnecessary reduction in economic activity, potentially placing the largest bur- dens on the most vulnerable groups of the population. Participants generally indicated that upside risks to the inflation outlook remained a key factor shaping the out- look for policy. A couple of participants noted that risks to the inflation outlook were becoming more balanced. Participants generally observed that maintaining a re- strictive policy stance for a sustained period until infla- tion is clearly on a path toward 2 percent is appropriate from a risk-management perspective. Committee Policy Action In their discussion of monetary policy for this meeting, members agreed that recent indicators pointed to mod- est growth in spending and production. Members also concurred that job gains had been robust in recent months, and the unemployment rate had remained low. Members agreed that inflation had remained elevated, reflecting supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic, higher food and energy prices, and broader price pressures. Members observed that Russia’s war against Ukraine was causing tremendous human and economic hardship. They also agreed that the war and related events were contributing to upward pressure on inflation and were weighing on global economic activity. Members con- curred that they remained highly attentive to inflation risks. Members agreed that the Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 per- cent over the longer run. In support of these goals, members agreed to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 4¼ to 4½ percent. Members anticipated that ongoing increases in the target range would be ap- propriate in order to attain a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 per- cent over time. Members agreed that, in determining the pace of future increases in the target range, they would take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects eco- nomic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments. In addition, members agreed that they would continue reducing the Federal Reserve’s holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mort- gage-backed securities, as described in the Plans for Re- ducing the Size of the Federal Reserve's Balance Sheet that were issued in May. All members affirmed that the Committee is strongly committed to returning inflation to its 2 percent objective. Members agreed that, in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, they would continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. They would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals. Mem- bers agreed that their assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on pub- lic health, labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and interna- tional developments. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the fol- lowing domestic policy directive, for release at 2:00 p.m.: “Effective December 15, 2022, the Federal Open Market Committee directs the Desk to: • Undertake open market operations as nec- essary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of 4¼ to 4½ percent. • Conduct overnight repurchase agreement operations with a minimum bid rate of 4.5 percent and with an aggregate operation limit of $500 billion; the aggregate opera- tion limit can be temporarily increased at the discretion of the Chair. • Conduct overnight reverse repurchase agreement operations at an offering rate of 4.3 percent and with a per-counterparty limit of $160 billion per day; the per-counterparty limit can be temporarily increased at the discretion of the Chair. Page 10 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ • Roll over at auction the amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s hold- ings of Treasury securities maturing in each calendar month that exceeds a cap of $60 billion per month. Redeem Treasury coupon securities up to this monthly cap and Treasury bills to the extent that coupon principal payments are less than the monthly cap. • Reinvest into agency mortgage-backed se- curities (MBS) the amount of principal pay- ments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of agency debt and agency MBS received in each calendar month that exceeds a cap of $35 billion per month. • Allow modest deviations from stated amounts for reinvestments, if needed for operational reasons. • Engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settle- ment of the Federal Reserve’s agency MBS transactions.” The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below for release at 2:00 p.m.: “Recent indicators point to modest growth in spending and production. Job gains have been robust in recent months, and the unemploy- ment rate has remained low. Inflation remains elevated, reflecting supply and demand imbal- ances related to the pandemic, higher food and energy prices, and broader price pressures. Russia’s war against Ukraine is causing tremen- dous human and economic hardship. The war and related events are contributing to upward pressure on inflation and are weighing on global economic activity. The Committee is highly at- tentive to inflation risks. The Committee seeks to achieve maximum em- ployment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. In support of these goals, the Committee decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 4¼ to 4½ percent. The Committee anticipates that ongoing in- creases in the target range will be appropriate in 5 In taking this action, the Board approved requests to estab- lish that rate submitted by the Boards of Directors of the Fed- order to attain a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent over time. In determining the pace of future increases in the target range, the Com- mittee will take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial devel- opments. In addition, the Committee will con- tinue reducing its holdings of Treasury securi- ties and agency debt and agency mortgage- backed securities, as described in the Plans for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve’s Bal- ance Sheet that were issued in May. The Com- mittee is strongly committed to returning infla- tion to its 2 percent objective. In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals. The Committee’s assessments will take into account a wide range of information, in- cluding readings on public health, labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation ex- pectations, and financial and international de- velopments.” Voting for this action: Jerome H. Powell, John C. Williams, Michael S. Barr, Michelle W. Bowman, Lael Brainard, James Bullard, Susan M. Collins, Lisa D. Cook, Esther L. George, Philip N. Jefferson, Loretta J. Mester, and Christopher J. Waller. Voting against this action: None. To support the Committee’s decision to raise the target range for the federal funds rate, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted unanimously to raise the interest rate paid on reserve balances to 4.4 per- cent, effective December 15, 2022. The Board of Gov- ernors of the Federal Reserve System voted unanimously to approve a ½ percentage point increase in the primary credit rate to 4.5 percent, effective December 15, 2022.5 It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Tuesday–Wednesday, January 31– eral Reserve Banks of Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Cleve- land, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco.

The Guidelines for the Conduct of System Open Market Operations in Federal-Agency Is- sues remained suspended. AUTHORIZATION FOR DOMESTIC OPEN MARKET OPERATIONS (As reaffirmed effective January 26, 2021) OPEN MARKET TRANSACTIONS 1. The Federal Open Market Committee (the “Com- mittee”) authorizes and directs the Federal Reserve Bank selected by the Committee to execute open market trans- actions (the “Selected Bank”), to the extent necessary to carry out the most recent domestic policy directive adopted by the Committee: A. To buy or sell in the open market securities that are direct obligations of, or fully guaranteed as to prin- cipal and interest by, the United States, and securities that are direct obligations of, or fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, any agency of the United States, that are eligible for purchase or sale under Sec- tion 14(b) of the Federal Reserve Act (“Eligible Secu- rities”) for the System Open Market Account (“SOMA”): i. As an outright operation with securities dealers and foreign and international accounts maintained at the Selected Bank: on a same-day or deferred de- livery basis (including such transactions as are com- monly referred to as dollar rolls and coupon swaps) at market prices; or ii. As a temporary operation: on a same-day or deferred delivery basis, to purchase such Eligible Se- curities subject to an agreement to resell (“repo transactions”) or to sell such Eligible Securities sub- ject to an agreement to repurchase (“reverse repo transactions”) for a term of 65 business days or less, at rates that, unless otherwise authorized by the Committee, are determined by competitive bidding, after applying reasonable limitations on the volume of agreements with individual counterparties; B. To allow Eligible Securities in the SOMA to ma- ture without replacement; C. To exchange, at market prices, in connection with a Treasury auction, maturing Eligible Securities in the SOMA with the Treasury, in the case of Eligible Securities that are direct obligations of the United States or that are fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by the United States; and D. To exchange, at market prices, maturing Eligible Securities in the SOMA with an agency of the United States, in the case of Eligible Securities that are direct obligations of that agency or that are fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by that agency. SECURITIES LENDING 2. In order to ensure the effective conduct of open market operations, the Committee authorizes the Se- lected Bank to operate a program to lend Eligible Secu- rities held in the SOMA to dealers on an overnight basis (except that the Selected Bank may lend Eligible Securi- ties for longer than an overnight term to accommodate weekend, holiday, and similar trading conventions). A. Such securities lending must be: i. At rates determined by competitive bidding; ii. At a minimum lending fee consistent with the objectives of the program; _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Minutes of the Meeting of January 26–27, 2021 Page 3 iii. Subject to reasonable limitations on the total amount of a specific issue of Eligible Securities that may be auctioned; and iv. Subject to reasonable limitations on the amount of Eligible Securities that each borrower may borrow. B. The Selected Bank may: i. Reject bids that, as determined in its sole dis- cretion, could facilitate a bidder’s ability to control a single issue; ii. Accept Treasury securities or cash as collateral for any loan of securities authorized in this para- graph 2; and iii. Accept agency securities as collateral only for a loan of agency securities authorized in this para- graph 2. OPERATIONAL READINESS TESTING 3. The Committee authorizes the Selected Bank to undertake transactions of the type described in para- graphs 1 and 2 from time to time for the purpose of test- ing operational readiness, subject to the following limi- tations: A. All transactions authorized in this paragraph 3 shall be conducted with prior notice to the Commit- tee; B. The aggregate par value of the transactions au- thorized in this paragraph 3 that are of the type de- scribed in paragraph 1.A.i, 1.B, 1.C and 1.D shall not exceed $5 billion per calendar year; and C. The outstanding amount of the transactions de- scribed in paragraphs 1.A.ii and 2 shall not exceed $5 billion at any given time. TRANSACTIONS WITH CUSTOMER ACCOUNTS 4. In order to ensure the effective conduct of open market operations, while assisting in the provision of short-term investments or other authorized services for foreign central bank and international accounts main- tained at a Federal Reserve Bank (the “Foreign Ac- counts”) and accounts maintained at a Federal Reserve Bank as fiscal agent of the United States pursuant to sec- tion 15 of the Federal Reserve Act (together with the Foreign Accounts, the “Customer Accounts”), the Com- mittee authorizes the following when undertaken on terms comparable to those available in the open market: A. The Selected Bank, for the SOMA, to: i. Undertake reverse repo transactions in Eligible Securities held in the SOMA with the Customer Ac- counts for a term of 65 business days or less; and ii. Undertake repo transactions in Eligible Securi- ties with Foreign Accounts; and B. Any Federal Reserve Bank that maintains Cus- tomer Accounts, for any such Customer Account, when appropriate and subject to all other necessary authorization and approvals, to: i. Undertake repo transactions in Eligible Securi- ties with dealers with a corresponding reverse repo transaction in such Eligible Securities with the Cus- tomer Accounts; and ii. Undertake intra-day repo transactions in Eligi- ble Securities with Foreign Accounts. Transactions undertaken with Customer Accounts un- der the provisions of this paragraph 4 may provide for a service fee when appropriate. Transactions undertaken with Customer Accounts are also subject to the authori- zation or approval of other entities, including the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and, when involving accounts maintained at a Federal Reserve Bank as fiscal agent of the United States, the United States Department of the Treasury. ADDITIONAL MATTERS 5. The Committee authorizes the Chair of the Com- mittee, in fostering the Committee’s objectives during any period between meetings of the Committee, to in- struct the Selected Bank to act on behalf of the Commit- tee to: A. Adjust somewhat in exceptional circumstances the stance of monetary policy and to take actions that may result in material changes in the composition and size of the assets in the SOMA; or B. Undertake transactions with respect to Eligible Securities in order to appropriately address temporary disruptions of an operational or highly unusual nature in U.S. dollar funding markets. Any such adjustment described in subparagraph A of this paragraph 5 shall be made in the context of the Committee’s discussion and decision about the stance of policy at its most recent meeting and the Committee’s long-run objectives to foster maximum employment and price stability, and shall be based on economic, financial, Page 4 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ and monetary developments since the most recent meet- ing of the Committee. The Chair, whenever feasible, will consult with the Committee before making any instruc- tion under this paragraph 5. AUTHORIZATION FOR FOREIGN CURRENCY OPERATIONS (As reaffirmed effective January 26, 2021) IN GENERAL 1. The Federal Open Market Committee (the “Com- mittee”) authorizes the Federal Reserve Bank selected by the Committee (the “Selected Bank”) to execute open market transactions for the System Open Market Ac- count as provided in this Authorization, to the extent necessary to carry out any foreign currency directive of the Committee: A. To purchase and sell foreign currencies (also known as cable transfers) at home and abroad in the open market, including with the United States Treas- ury, with foreign monetary authorities, with the Bank for International Settlements, and with other entities in the open market. This authorization to purchase and sell foreign currencies encompasses purchases and sales through standalone spot or forward transactions and through foreign exchange swap transactions. For purposes of this Authorization, foreign exchange swap transactions are: swap transactions with the United States Treasury (also known as warehousing transactions), swap transactions with other central banks under reciprocal currency arrangements, swap transactions with other central banks under standing dollar liquidity and foreign currency liquidity swap ar- rangements, and swap transactions with other entities in the open market. B. To hold balances of, and to have outstanding for- ward contracts to receive or to deliver, foreign curren- cies. 2.

STANDALONE SPOT AND FORWARD TRANS- ACTIONS 3. For any operation that involves standalone spot or forward transactions in foreign currencies: A. Approval of such operation is required as fol- lows: i. The Committee must direct the Selected Bank in advance to execute the operation if it would result in the overall volume of standalone spot and for- ward transactions in foreign currencies, as defined in paragraph 3.C of this Authorization, exceeding $5 billion since the close of the most recent regular meeting of the Committee. The Foreign Currency Subcommittee (the “Subcommittee”) must direct the Selected Bank in advance to execute the opera- tion if the Subcommittee believes that consultation with the Committee is not feasible in the time avail- able. ii. The Committee authorizes the Subcommittee to direct the Selected Bank in advance to execute the operation if it would result in the overall volume of standalone spot and forward transactions in foreign currencies, as defined in paragraph 3.C of this Au- thorization, totaling $5 billion or less since the close of the most recent regular meeting of the Commit- tee. B. Such an operation also shall be: i. Generally directed at countering disorderly market conditions; or ii. Undertaken to adjust System balances in light of probable future needs for currencies; or iii. Conducted for such other purposes as may be determined by the Committee. C. For purposes of this Authorization, the overall volume of standalone spot and forward transactions in foreign currencies is defined as the sum (disregard- ing signs) of the dollar values of individual foreign cur- rencies purchased and sold, valued at the time of the transaction. _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Minutes of the Meeting of January 26–27, 2021 Page 5 WAREHOUSING 4. The Committee authorizes the Selected Bank, with the prior approval of the Subcommittee and at the re- quest of the United States Treasury, to conduct swap transactions with the United States Exchange Stabiliza- tion Fund established by section 10 of the Gold Reserve Act of 1934 under agreements in which the Selected Bank purchases foreign currencies from the Exchange Stabilization Fund and the Exchange Stabilization Fund repurchases the foreign currencies from the Selected Bank at a later date (such purchases and sales also known as warehousing). RECIPROCAL CURRENCY ARRANGEMENTS, AND STANDING DOLLAR AND FOREIGN CUR- RENCY LIQUIDITY SWAPS 5. The Committee authorizes the Selected Bank to maintain reciprocal currency arrangements established under the North American Framework Agreement, standing dollar liquidity swap arrangements, temporary dollar liquidity swap arrangements, and standing foreign currency liquidity swap arrangements as provided in this Authorization and to the extent necessary to carry out any foreign currency directive of the Committee. A. For reciprocal currency arrangements all draw- ings must be approved in advance by the Committee (or by the Subcommittee, if the Subcommittee be- lieves that consultation with the Committee is not fea- sible in the time available). B. For standing and temporary dollar liquidity swap arrangements all drawings must be approved in ad- vance by the Chair. The Chair may approve a schedule of potential drawings, and may delegate to the man- ager, System Open Market Account, the authority to approve individual drawings that occur according to the schedule approved by the Chair. C. For standing foreign currency liquidity swap ar- rangements all drawings must be approved in advance by the Committee (or by the Subcommittee, if the Subcommittee believes that consultation with the Committee is not feasible in the time available). D. Operations involving standing and temporary dollar liquidity swap arrangements and standing for- eign currency liquidity swap arrangements shall gener- ally be directed at countering strains in financial mar- kets in the United States or abroad, or reducing the risk that they could emerge, so as to mitigate their ef- fects on economic and financial conditions in the United States. E. For reciprocal currency arrangements, standing and temporary dollar liquidity swap arrangements, and standing foreign currency liquidity swap arrangements: i. All arrangements are subject to annual review and approval by the Committee; ii. Any new arrangements must be approved by the Committee; and iii. Any changes in the terms of existing arrange- ments must be approved in advance by the Chair. The Chair shall keep the Committee informed of any changes in terms, and the terms shall be con- sistent with principles discussed with and guidance provided by the Committee. OTHER OPERATIONS IN FOREIGN CURREN- CIES 6. Any other operations in foreign currencies for which governance is not otherwise specified in this Au- thorization (such as foreign exchange swap transactions with private-sector counterparties) must be authorized and directed in advance by the Committee. FOREIGN CURRENCY HOLDINGS 7. The Committee authorizes the Selected Bank to hold foreign currencies for the System Open Market Ac- count in accounts maintained at foreign central banks, the Bank for International Settlements, and such other foreign institutions as approved by the Board of Gover- nors under Section 214.5 of Regulation N, to the extent necessary to carry out any foreign currency directive of the Committee. A. The Selected Bank shall manage all holdings of foreign currencies for the System Open Market Ac- count: i. Primarily, to ensure sufficient liquidity to ena- ble the Selected Bank to conduct foreign currency operations as directed by the Committee; ii. Secondarily, to maintain a high degree of safety; iii. Subject to paragraphs 7.A.i and 7.A.ii, to pro- vide the highest rate of return possible in each cur- rency; and iv. To achieve such other objectives as may be au- thorized by the Committee. Page 6 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ B.

Purchasing and selling obligations of, or fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, a foreign government or agency thereof (“Permitted Foreign Securities”) through outright purchases and sales; ii. Purchasing Permitted Foreign Securities under agreements for repurchase of such Permitted For- eign Securities and selling such securities under agreements for the resale of such securities; and iii. Managing balances in various time and other deposit accounts at foreign institutions approved by the Board of Governors under Regulation N. C. The Subcommittee, in consultation with the Committee, may provide additional instructions to the Selected Bank regarding holdings of foreign curren- cies. ADDITIONAL MATTERS 8.

With the prior approval of the Committee, to en- ter into any needed agreement or understanding with the Secretary of the United States Treasury about the division of responsibility for foreign currency opera- tions between the System and the United States Treas- ury; B. To advise the Secretary of the United States Treasury concerning System foreign currency opera- tions, and to consult with the Secretary on policy mat- ters relating to foreign currency operations; C.

The aggregate amount of such transactions shall not exceed $2.5 billion per calendar year. These transactions shall be conducted with prior notice to the Committee. 10. All Federal Reserve banks shall participate in the foreign currency operations for System Open Market Account in accordance with paragraph 3G(1) of the Board of Governors’ Statement of Procedure with Re- spect to Foreign Relationships of Federal Reserve Banks dated January 1, 1944. 11. Any authority of the Subcommittee pursuant to this Authorization may be exercised by the Chair if the Chair believes that consultation with the Subcommittee is not feasible in the time available. The Chair shall promptly report to the Subcommittee any action ap- proved by the Chair pursuant to this paragraph. 12. The Committee authorizes the Chair, in excep- tional circumstances where it would not be feasible to convene the Committee, to foster the Committee’s ob- jectives by instructing the Selected Bank to engage in foreign currency operations not otherwise authorized pursuant to this Authorization. Any such action shall be made in the context of the Committee’s discussion and decisions regarding foreign currency operations. The Chair, whenever feasible, will consult with the Commit- tee before making any instruction under this paragraph. __________________________ 1 In general, as specified in Article IV, each member of the IMF undertakes to collaborate with the IMF and other members to assure orderly exchange arrangements and to promote a stable system of exchange rates. These obligations include seeking to direct the member’s economic and financial policies toward the objective of fostering orderly economic growth with reasonable price stability. These obligations also include avoiding manipulating exchange rates or the international monetary system in such a way that would impede effective balance of payments adjustment or to give an unfair competitive advantage over other members.

By unanimous vote, the Committee reaffirmed its Pro- gram for Security of FOMC Information with minor technical changes. In the Committee’s annual reconsideration of the State- ment on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strat- egy, all participants supported the statement as written, and the Committee voted unanimously to reaffirm without revision. STATEMENT ON LONGER-RUN GOALS AND MONETARY POLICY STRATEGY (As reaffirmed effective January 26, 2021) The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is firmly committed to fulfilling its statutory mandate from the Congress of promoting maximum employment, sta- ble prices, and moderate long-term interest rates. The Committee seeks to explain its monetary policy deci- sions to the public as clearly as possible. Such clarity facilitates well-informed decisionmaking by households and businesses, reduces economic and financial uncer- tainty, increases the effectiveness of monetary policy, and enhances transparency and accountability, which are essential in a democratic society. Employment, inflation, and long-term interest rates fluctuate over time in response to economic and finan- cial disturbances. Monetary policy plays an important role in stabilizing the economy in response to these dis- turbances. The Committee’s primary means of adjusting the stance of monetary policy is through changes in the target range for the federal funds rate. The Committee judges that the level of the federal funds rate consistent with maximum employment and price stability over the longer run has declined relative to its historical average. Therefore, the federal funds rate is likely to be con- strained by its effective lower bound more frequently Page 8 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ than in the past. Owing in part to the proximity of in- terest rates to the effective lower bound, the Committee judges that downward risks to employment and inflation have increased. The Committee is prepared to use its full range of tools to achieve its maximum employment and price stability goals. The maximum level of employment is a broad-based and inclusive goal that is not directly measurable and changes over time owing largely to nonmonetary factors that affect the structure and dynamics of the labor mar- ket. Consequently, it would not be appropriate to spec- ify a fixed goal for employment; rather, the Committee’s policy decisions must be informed by assessments of the shortfalls of employment from its maximum level, rec- ognizing that such assessments are necessarily uncertain and subject to revision. The Committee considers a wide range of indicators in making these assessments. The inflation rate over the longer run is primarily de- termined by monetary policy, and hence the Committee has the ability to specify a longer-run goal for inflation. The Committee reaffirms its judgment that inflation at the rate of 2 percent, as measured by the annual change in the price index for personal consumption expendi- tures, is most consistent over the longer run with the Federal Reserve’s statutory mandate. The Committee judges that longer-term inflation expectations that are well anchored at 2 percent foster price stability and mod- erate long-term interest rates and enhance the Commit- tee’s ability to promote maximum employment in the face of significant economic disturbances. In order to anchor longer-term inflation expectations at this level, the Committee seeks to achieve inflation that averages 2 percent over time, and therefore judges that, following periods when inflation has been running persistently be- low 2 percent, appropriate monetary policy will likely aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time. Monetary policy actions tend to influence economic activity, employment, and prices with a lag. In setting monetary policy, the Committee seeks over time to mit- igate shortfalls of employment from the Committee’s as- sessment of its maximum level and deviations of infla- tion from its longer-run goal. Moreover, sustainably achieving maximum employment and price stability de- pends on a stable financial system. Therefore, the Com- mittee’s policy decisions reflect its longer-run goals, its medium-term outlook, and its assessments of the bal- ance of risks, including risks to the financial system that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals. The Committee’s employment and inflation objectives are generally complementary. However, under circum- stances in which the Committee judges that the objec- tives are not complementary, it takes into account the employment shortfalls and inflation deviations and the potentially different time horizons over which employ- ment and inflation are projected to return to levels judged consistent with its mandate. The Committee intends to review these principles and to make adjustments as appropriate at its annual organi- zational meeting each January, and to undertake roughly every 5 years a thorough public review of its monetary policy strategy, tools, and communication practices. Developments in Financial Markets and Open Market Operations The manager turned first to a discussion of financial market developments. The evolving outlooks for the path of the virus and for fiscal policy were the main driv- ers of financial markets over the intermeeting period. Progress on vaccinations had been slower than expected, and the near-term trajectory of the pandemic worsened, weighing on economic activity. However, even with the appearance of new strains of the virus, market confi- dence in the ultimate efficacy of the vaccination efforts seemed to remain high. The emergence of a narrow Democratic majority in the Senate bolstered investor ex- pectations for additional fiscal stimulus, prompting up- ward revisions to forecasts for economic growth this year. In the Open Market Desk Survey of Primary Deal- ers, the median 2021 gross domestic product (GDP) growth forecast rose about 1 percentage point. Against this backdrop, longer-term Treasury yields rose notably over the period. Longer-dated real yields were lifted by expectations for improved growth and in- creased Treasury issuance, but remained deeply negative. Measures of inflation compensation increased over the period, with the five-year, five-year-forward measure ris- ing to a level of around 2 percent. Overall financial con- ditions eased further, on net, as the recent rally in risk assets continued. Gains in U.S. equities again centered on cyclical sectors and smaller-capitalization firms most sensitive to growth. Credit spreads narrowed further, especially for riskier borrowers. Expectations for the path of the target federal funds rate over the next several years, as implied by interest rate futures and by the Desk Survey of Primary Dealers and Survey of Market Participants, were relatively little changed from December. The stability in near-term pol- icy rate expectations amid an improving growth outlook appeared consistent with the Committee’s new frame- work and forward interest rate guidance. Although the median Desk survey respondent continued to expect _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Minutes of the Meeting of January 26–27, 2021 Page 9 12-month personal consumption expenditure (PCE) in- flation of 2.3 percent when the FOMC first lifts the tar- get range, the median expectation for the unemployment rate prevailing at that time was modestly lower than in December. The Desk survey results indicated that a ma- jority of market participants anticipated that the pace of net asset purchases would remain stable for the remain- der of the year and slow around the first quarter of 2022. The manager next discussed conditions in funding mar- kets. Over the year-end, overnight secured and unse- cured rates were little changed at rates just below the in- terest on excess reserves (IOER) rate even as financial firms managed their balance sheets for the reporting date. Going forward, reserves were projected to rise rap- idly through the summer, reflecting ongoing Federal Re- serve asset purchases as well as expected declines in bal- ances held in the Treasury General Account. Market pricing suggested that the effective federal funds rate was expected to decline modestly through the second quarter. Even if more notable downward pressure on money market rates emerged, the manager anticipated that the Federal Reserve’s tools, including the IOER rate and overnight reverse repurchase agreement facility, would continue to provide effective control over the federal funds rate and other overnight money market rates. Finally, the manager discussed Desk operations. A range of indicators suggested that both fixed-income and funding markets continued to function smoothly over the period. The manager noted that, in the coming pe- riod, the Desk anticipated implementing two adjust- ments to continue to normalize operations. First, given the sustained stability in term repurchase markets, the Desk proposed discontinuing the weekly one-month term repurchase operations, beginning in mid-February. In addition, the Desk planned to reduce the frequency of agency commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) operations in light of the sustained improve- ment in market conditions for these securities. By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk’s domestic transactions over the intermeeting period. No intervention operations occurred in foreign currencies for the System’s account during the intermeeting period. Staff Review of the Economic Situation The COVID-19 pandemic and the measures undertaken to contain its spread continued to affect economic activ- ity in the United States and abroad. The information available at the time of the January 26–27 meeting sug- gested that U.S. real GDP had continued to advance in the fourth quarter of 2020, albeit at a pace that was mark- edly slower than the rapid rate seen in the third quarter, while the level of real GDP had not yet returned to the level seen before the onset of the pandemic. Labor mar- ket conditions deteriorated, on balance, in December, and employment continued to be well below its level at the start of 2020. Consumer price inflation through No- vember—as measured by the 12-month percentage change in the PCE price index—remained considerably lower than the rates seen in early 2020. Total nonfarm payroll employment fell in December, with especially sharp declines in the leisure and hospital- ity sector. As of December, payroll employment had re- traced a little more than half of the losses seen at the onset of the pandemic. The unemployment rate held steady at 6.7 percent in December. The unemployment rate for African Americans declined and the Hispanic unemployment rate rose; both rates remained well above the national average. However, the Asian unemploy- ment rate moved below the national average in Decem- ber. Both the labor force participation rate and employ- ment-to-population ratio were unchanged in December. Initial claims for unemployment insurance in mid-Janu- ary were higher than their early December level. Weekly estimates of private-sector payrolls constructed by Fed- eral Reserve Board staff using data provided by the pay- roll processor ADP indicated that the four-week average change in private employment in mid-January was slightly lower than it had been in early December; how- ever, the most recent week-to-week changes in this measure of payrolls had been highly volatile. Average hourly earnings for all employees rose 5.1 per- cent over the 12 months ending in December, a gain that was noticeably higher than the measure’s year-earlier 12-month change. The 12-month change in average hourly earnings continued to be dominated by changes in the composition of the workforce, with the concen- tration of job losses among lower-wage workers over the pandemic period resulting in outsized increases in this measure of earnings that were not indicative of tight la- bor market conditions. By contrast, a staff measure of the 12-month change in the median wage derived from the ADP data—a measure likely to have been less af- fected by changes in workforce composition—was 3½ percent in December and remained well below its pre-pandemic pace. Total PCE price inflation was 1.1 percent over the 12 months ending in November and continued to be held down by relatively weak aggregate demand and the declines in consumer energy prices seen over the first Page 10 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ part of 2020. Core PCE price inflation, which excludes changes in consumer energy prices and many consumer food prices, was 1.4 percent over the 12 months ending in November, while the trimmed mean measure of 12-month PCE inflation constructed by the Federal Re- serve Bank of Dallas was 1.7 percent in November. In December, the 12-month change in the consumer price index (CPI) was 1.4 percent, while core CPI inflation was 1.6 percent over the same period. The latest read- ings on survey-based measures of longer-run inflation expectations ticked higher. In the first part of January, the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers meas- ure for the next 5 to 10 years moved back up to its late-summer level, while in December, the 3-year-ahead measure of inflation expectations produced by the Fed- eral Reserve Bank of New York moved back up to its August level. Real PCE fell in November, and available indicators— including the components of the nominal retail sales data used to estimate PCE—pointed to a further decline in December. Housing starts and construction permits moved up in November and December and finished the year well above their pre-pandemic levels. Although home sales turned down in November, the decline ap- peared to reflect limited availability of homes for sale ra- ther than weakening demand. Available indicators pointed to a strong increase in in- vestment in equipment and intangibles in the fourth quarter of 2020, as this component of capital spending recovered from its sharp decline over the first half of the year. Likewise, drilling investment appeared to have turned up sharply, albeit from a low level, as oil prices moved higher. By contrast, investment in nonresidential structures outside of the drilling and mining sector ap- peared to have declined further in the fourth quarter and had likely been restrained by firms’ continued hesitation to commit to projects with lengthy times to completion and uncertain future returns. Industrial production advanced further in the fourth quarter, led by a solid gain in manufacturing output, but had not yet overtaken its pre-pandemic level. The low level of export demand since the onset of the pandemic had likely continued to restrain the recovery in the man- ufacturing sector; in addition, production of motor ve- hicles and parts was a small drag on manufacturing out- put in the fourth quarter as automotive producers ap- peared to have had difficulty getting assemblies fully un- der way for the new model year. Total real government purchases appeared to have fallen further in the fourth quarter, though at a slower pace than in the third quarter. Available data suggested that real federal purchases had posted a modest gain, as an increase in defense purchases offset a reduction in non- defense purchases; however, indicators of real state and local purchases, including state and local government employment, pointed to a fourth-quarter decline similar in size to what had been seen in the third quarter. The nominal U.S. international trade deficit widened fur- ther in November. Both imports and exports continued to rebound from their collapse in the first half of the year. Goods imports rose in November to a level well above that of the previous January, with gains in most major categories. Although exports also grew in No- vember, they had not yet recovered to their January 2020 level. Services trade continued a gradual rise but re- mained depressed, driven by the continued suspension of most international travel. Taken together, these data suggested that net exports made a significant negative contribution to real GDP growth in the fourth quarter. Recent data pointed to a sharp slowing in foreign eco- nomic growth in the fourth quarter, after a strong re- bound in the third quarter. Amid a further intensifica- tion of the pandemic, many foreign governments tight- ened social-distancing restrictions. In a few countries, the emergence of new and more contagious virus strains was accompanied by a surge in COVID-19 cases and deaths. The increased virus spread and restrictions ap- peared to take a toll on foreign economic activity, par- ticularly in Europe. The global slowdown was most no- table for services, with further declines in purchasing managers indexes for this sector through January in many advanced foreign economies. By contrast, manu- facturing output in both advanced and emerging foreign economies continued to expand at a solid pace, sup- ported by resilient demand for durable goods, high-tech goods, and medical supplies. Amid the generally weak economic situation, inflationary pressures remained sub- dued in most foreign economies. Staff Review of the Financial Situation Investor sentiment improved and risk asset prices moved higher over the intermeeting period on greater prospects for additional fiscal stimulus. Domestic and foreign equity prices increased notably, and spreads on corporate and municipal bonds narrowed. The nominal Treasury yield curve steepened, partly reflecting an in- crease in inflation compensation. Market-based financ- ing conditions remained accommodative, while bank lending conditions continued to be tight. However, a smaller net share of banks tightened lending standards than in previous quarters. _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Minutes of the Meeting of January 26–27, 2021 Page 11 A straight read of overnight index swap (OIS) quotes suggested that the expected path of the federal funds rate beyond mid-2023 rose moderately over the inter- meeting period, with the increases reportedly associated largely with greater investor optimism regarding the ex- pected speed of the economic recovery. OIS quotes suggested that the expected policy rate would remain be- low 25 basis points until the third quarter of 2023, little changed from the time of the December meeting. The yield on 2-year nominal Treasury securities was little changed over the intermeeting period, while the 10-year yield rose notably. Most of the steepening of the Treas- ury yield curve occurred following the outcome of the Georgia runoff elections, which reportedly bolstered market participants’ expectations for additional fiscal stimulus. The FOMC’s updated guidance around asset purchases was seen as broadly in line with expectations and did not elicit noticeable financial market reaction. Measures of inflation compensation based on Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities increased moderately, on net, continuing the upward trend observed over recent months, with the increase over the intermeeting period reportedly reflecting greater prospects for additional fis- cal stimulus and an associated improvement in the longer-run economic outlook. Broad stock price indexes increased, on net, over the in- termeeting period, boosted by gains in the share prices of banks and companies in more cyclically sensitive sec- tors, reportedly reflecting, in part, increased expectations of fiscal stimulus. One-month option-implied volatility on the S&P 500—the VIX—was little changed, on net, remaining modestly elevated relative to its range over the past several years. Consistent with the optimism driving stock prices, spreads on corporate bond yields over comparable-maturity Treasury yields narrowed some- what. Spreads on municipal bond yields narrowed nota- bly in January, reportedly reflecting increased expecta- tions of additional fiscal stimulus and aid to state and local governments. Conditions in short-term funding markets remained sta- ble over the intermeeting period, including over the year- end. Spreads for commercial paper and negotiable cer- tificates of deposit across tenors were largely unchanged at historically low levels. Commercial paper outstanding declined somewhat in late December but quickly re- bounded in early January to the levels observed before year-end. Amid stable market conditions, there was no take-up at the Commercial Paper Funding Facility or the Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility over the intermeeting period. Assets under management (AUM) of government money market funds (MMFs) remained stable over the intermeeting period. AUM of prime MMFs continued to decline, reaching the lowest level since late 2018, likely reflecting the compressed net yield advantage for prime funds relative to yields for govern- ment funds. The net yields of both prime and govern- ment MMFs remained near historically low levels. The effective federal funds rate and the Secured Over- night Financing Rate were little changed, averaging 9 ba- sis points and 8 basis points, respectively, over the inter- meeting period. There continued to be no participation in the Fed’s repurchase agreement (repo) operations, and participation in the Fed’s reverse repo facility was minimal. In foreign financial markets, the prospect of additional U.S. fiscal stimulus and the passage of key risk events such as the Brexit trade agreement largely outweighed investor concerns around new virus strains and the slug- gish global vaccine rollout. On balance, foreign equity prices increased moderately, with notable outperfor- mance in some Asian indexes, and capital inflows into mutual funds dedicated to emerging markets continued at a robust pace. Longer-term sovereign yields in most advanced foreign economies rose slightly on improved investor sentiment even while several major central banks reaffirmed their commitment to continue or pos- sibly expand accommodative policies. The broad dollar index was little changed, on net, over the intermeeting period, while the Chinese renminbi appreciated notably against the dollar as data showed a robust economic re- covery in China. Dollar funding conditions were gener- ally stable around year-end. Financing conditions in capital markets remained broadly accommodative, supported by low interest rates and high equity valuations. Gross corporate bond issu- ance was fairly strong in November and December, and seasoned and initial public offerings in the equity mar- kets were robust. Gross institutional leveraged loan is- suance was also strong in December, as issuance vol- umes excluding refinancing topped their averages for previous months of 2020 and were above those ob- served during the same period of 2019. Commercial and industrial (C&I) loan balances at banks continued to decline in December, albeit at a slower pace than in the fall. C&I loans declined in the fourth quarter because of weak origination activity, loan forgiveness at the Paycheck Protection Program, and continued repay- ments of bank debt. In the January Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices (SLOOS), banks, on net, reported weaker demand and tightened Page 12 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ lending standards for C&I loans, with notable differ- ences in reported changes across bank sizes. Large banks reported having eased standards to large and mid- dle-market firms, while, on net, banks of all sizes re- ported having tightened standards to small firms. How- ever, a smaller net percentage of banks tightened lending standards to firms of all sizes than in previous quarters. The credit quality of nonfinancial corporations remained stable in recent months after deteriorating substantially for several months following the onset of the pandemic. The volume of nonfinancial corporate bond downgrades continued to slightly outpace upgrades in November and December, and the monthly volume of nonfinancial cor- porate bond defaults remained relatively low. Market in- dicators of future default expectations moved slightly lower, essentially returning to their pre-pandemic levels. Financing conditions for small businesses remained tight, but small business loan originations in November, the most recent month for which data were available, were at roughly the level seen a year earlier, likely sup- ported by the refinancing of existing loans. Meanwhile, liquidity needs of small businesses remained high as businesses continued to operate at reduced capacity. Small business delinquency and default rates were little changed but remained elevated relative to the levels of recent years. Financing conditions in the municipal bond market remained generally accommodative over the intermeeting period, and the credit quality of munic- ipal debt remained roughly stable. For commercial real estate (CRE) financed through cap- ital markets, financing conditions remained generally ac- commodative, easing further over the intermeeting pe- riod. Spreads on agency CMBS ticked down, on net, and issuance remained elevated through December, al- though below its recent historical high in October. Risk spreads on triple-B non-agency CMBS declined, and spreads on triple-A non-agency CMBS stayed close to their historical lows. Issuance of non-agency CMBS re- mained somewhat below its pre-pandemic level. CRE bank loan growth remained weak in the fourth quarter amid depressed property transaction volumes. On net, in the January SLOOS, banks reported a further tighten- ing of lending standards and further weakening in de- mand for CRE loans. Financing conditions in the residential mortgage market were little changed over the intermeeting period. Mort- gage rates ticked up slightly but stayed near historically low levels, supporting strong loan origination activity. Credit remained broadly available to higher-score bor- rowers seeking conforming mortgages but tightened fur- ther, from already tight levels, for borrowers with lower credit scores and those seeking nonconforming mort- gages. The January SLOOS suggested that for most types of residential mortgages, banks’ lending standards remained unchanged, while loan demand was either little changed or somewhat stronger. Mortgage forbearance rates plateaued in December and early January after hav- ing gradually declined over the previous six months, and the rate of new delinquencies stayed at low, pre-pan- demic levels. Financing conditions in consumer credit markets gener- ally remained accommodative for borrowers with strong credit scores but tight for those with subprime scores. Banks in the January SLOOS reported easing standards for all consumer loan types and experiencing weaker de- mand for auto loans and little-changed demand for other consumer loans. Conditions in the asset-backed securi- ties market appeared supportive of lending. Credit card balances edged down further for both prime and nonprime borrowers, likely reflecting weak consumer spending. However, the volume of new cards and avail- able credit continued to rise for both prime and nonprime borrowers. Interest rates on new credit card offers for nonprime borrowers stayed elevated, and fi- nancing conditions remained tight for those borrowers. Auto loan balances continued to increase solidly for prime and near-prime borrowers but declined further for subprime borrowers. Auto loan interest rates were about flat over the past few months and remained sig- nificantly below their pre-pandemic levels. Delinquency rates for nonprime auto and credit card borrowers ticked up, albeit from very low levels. The staff provided an update on its assessments of the stability of the financial system and, on balance, charac- terized the financial vulnerabilities of the U.S. financial system as notable. The staff assessed asset valuation pressures as elevated. In particular, corporate bond spreads had declined to pre-pandemic levels, which were at the lower ends of their historical distributions. In ad- dition, measures of the equity risk premium declined fur- ther, returning to pre-pandemic levels. Prices for indus- trial and multifamily properties continued to grow through 2020 at about the same pace as in the past sev- eral years, while prices of office buildings and retail es- tablishments started to fall. The staff assessed vulnera- bilities associated with household and business borrow- ing as notable, reflecting increased leverage and de- creased incomes and revenues in 2020. Small businesses were hit particularly hard. The staff judged that vulner- _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Minutes of the Meeting of January 26–27, 2021 Page 13 abilities stemming from financial leverage were moder- ate, noting that capital ratios at the largest bank holding companies rose over the course of last year; leverage among hedge funds was elevated but it did decline last spring for the most highly leveraged funds. The staff characterized vulnerabilities stemming from funding risks as moderate. Banks continued to maintain signifi- cant levels of high-quality liquid assets and stable sources of funding. In contrast, money market funds and open- ended mutual funds were characterized by significant vulnerabilities associated with liquidity transformation. Staff Economic Outlook The U.S. economic projection prepared by the staff for the January FOMC meeting implied a considerably stronger outlook for activity in 2021 relative to the De- cember forecast. Although incoming data had been weaker than expected, the staff’s January projection in- corporated the effects of the stimulus in the recently en- acted Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 (CAA), to- gether with an assumption that an additional sizable tranche of fiscal support would be put into place in com- ing months. Taken together, these stimulus measures were expected to partly offset the substantial drag on ag- gregate demand that would result from the unwinding of the fiscal stimulus enacted in the spring of 2020. The staff’s projection continued to anticipate that widespread vaccination would allow for an easing in social distanc- ing in 2021. With the boost to growth from the reduc- tion in social distancing assumed to be largely completed by the end of 2021, GDP growth was expected to step down over the remainder of the medium term. Even so, the staff continued to project that real GDP growth would outpace that of potential over this period, leading to a considerable further decline in the unemployment rate. The 12-month changes in total and core PCE prices in coming months were projected to briefly move above 2 percent in the second quarter of 2021 as the unusually low observations from the spring of 2020 drop out of the 12-month calculation. Following these swings, infla- tion was expected to finish the year at just below 2 per- cent. Thereafter, inflation was projected to gradually edge up to 2 percent by the end of the medium term as labor and product markets tightened. With monetary policy assumed to remain accommodative, inflation was projected to moderately overshoot 2 percent for some time in the years beyond 2023. The staff viewed the possibility that a larger-than-antici- pated fiscal package would be enacted in coming months as a modest upside risk to the baseline economic out- look. However, the further rise in COVID-19 cases in the United States, coupled with developments such as the emergence of more-contagious strains of the virus in the United States and elsewhere, led the staff to continue to judge that the risks to the baseline projection were skewed to the downside and that the uncertainty around the forecast was elevated. Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook Participants noted that the COVID-19 pandemic was causing tremendous human and economic hardship across the United States and around the world. The pace of the recovery in economic activity and employment had moderated in recent months, with weakness concen- trated in the sectors of the economy most adversely af- fected by the resurgence of the virus and by greater so- cial distancing. Weaker demand and earlier declines in oil prices were holding down consumer price inflation. Overall financial conditions remained accommodative, in part reflecting the Federal Reserve’s actions to sup- port the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. house- holds and businesses. Participants agreed that the path of the economy would depend significantly on the course of the virus, including progress on vaccinations, and that the ongoing public health crisis would continue to weigh on economic activity, employment, and infla- tion and posed considerable risks to the economic out- look. Participants observed that the resurgence in COVID-19 infections and associated social-distancing measures were restraining activity in some sectors, particularly in industries such as travel and leisure and hospitality. Most participants expected that the stimulus provided by the passage of the CAA in December, the likelihood of additional fiscal support, and anticipated continued pro- gress in vaccinations would lead to a sizable boost in economic activity. Even so, participants noted that eco- nomic activity and employment were currently well be- low levels consistent with achieving maximum employ- ment. Participants commented on improved prospects for household spending over the course of the year, in part reflecting fiscal support. They saw progress on vaccina- tions as essential for supporting further gains in aggre- gate consumer spending and for the economic recovery more generally. In commenting on recent data for household spending, most participants discussed the composition of expenditures, with strong spending on Page 14 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ many goods, especially durables, and weakness in spend- ing on some services, especially in travel and in leisure and hospitality. The relative strength in consumer spending on goods was supported by fiscal programs such as federal stimulus payments and expanded unem- ployment benefits as well as by accommodative mone- tary policy. The weakness in services spending was largely attributed to the pandemic and associated social- distancing measures, which limited spending on services that depend heavily on in-person contact. Increased government transfers to households, combined with re- duced outlays on some services, had contributed to a his- torically large increase in aggregate household savings last year. Participants also observed that residential in- vestment and home sales remained robust; low interest rates were viewed as an important factor supporting the strength in housing activity. Most participants noted that the economic downturn had not fallen equally on all Americans and that those least able to shoulder the burden—in particular, lower- income and Black and Hispanic households—had been the hardest hit by the pandemic. Many participants stressed that sustained support from fiscal policy would help address the hardships faced by these groups and that monetary policy could also help by promoting the economy’s return to maximum employment and price stability. In their remarks on the business sector, participants commented that business equipment investment had continued to show strength while nonresidential con- struction remained weak. Participants also discussed the recent strong performance of the manufacturing sector. Many discussed supply chain issues in manufacturing, in- cluding those associated with acquiring material inputs and pandemic-related worker shortages and absentee- ism. Business contacts reported that firms in goods-pro- ducing industries, particularly larger firms and those in the durable goods or housing sectors, were adapting to the pandemic; in contrast, smaller firms and those in in- dustries most adversely affected by the pandemic were finding it more difficult to adapt. Many participants stated that their business contacts were optimistic that continued progress on vaccinations, together with fur- ther fiscal support, would result in more improvement in overall business conditions. Several participants noted the increase in agricultural crop prices over 2020 and the associated improvement in farm revenues. As with overall economic activity, the pace of improve- ment in the labor market had slowed in recent months. Payroll employment fell in December, as continued job gains in many industries were outweighed by significant layoffs in industries where the resurgence of the virus had weighed heavily on activity. While labor market conditions had improved significantly, on balance, since the spring, some participants noted that if the sizable number of workers who reported having left the labor force since the beginning of the pandemic were to be counted as unemployed, the unemployment rate would be substantially higher. Participants judged that the cur- rent low level of labor force participation likely reflected a number of factors, including health concerns and ad- ditional childcare responsibilities. Over the medium term, participants expected strong growth in employ- ment, driven by continued progress on vaccinations and an associated rebound of economic activity and of con- sumer and business confidence, as well as accommoda- tive fiscal and monetary policy. However, participants observed that the economy was far from achieving the Committee’s broad-based and inclusive goal of maxi- mum employment and that even with a brisk pace of im- provement in the labor market, achieving this goal would take some time. In their comments about inflation, participants noted that headline PCE price inflation in December, meas- ured on a 12-month basis, was poised to come in well below the Committee’s 2 percent longer-term objective. In the relatively near term, a number of participants sug- gested that there could be increases in the prices of some goods whose production has been subject to supply chain constraints, or soon could be; others anticipated that a possibly abrupt return to normal levels of activity could result in one-time increases in certain prices. Many participants stressed the importance of distin- guishing between such one-time changes in relative prices and changes in the underlying trend for inflation, noting that changes in relative prices could temporarily raise measured inflation but would be unlikely to have a lasting effect. Some participants further observed that 12-month PCE inflation was likely to move somewhat above 2 percent for a brief period in the spring as the unusually low monthly observations from last spring roll out of the 12-month calculation. Outside of such near- term fluctuations, participants generally anticipated that inflation would move up along a trajectory consistent with achieving the Committee’s objectives over time, supported by stronger economic activity, widespread vaccinations and the associated reduction in social dis- tancing, and accommodative fiscal and monetary policy. Some participants pointed to the continued increase in market-based measures of inflation compensation from the very low levels recorded in the spring as consistent _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Minutes of the Meeting of January 26–27, 2021 Page 15 with the view that inflation was likely to move up grad- ually over time; others noted that survey-based measures were little changed, on net, over the year as a whole. Participants noted that overall financial conditions re- mained highly accommodative, in part reflecting inves- tors’ optimism about the economic outlook along with the accommodative stance of monetary policy and re- cent and expected future fiscal policy measures. How- ever, a few participants remarked that credit conditions were relatively tight for borrowers with low credit scores and for some small and medium-sized businesses that rely on bank lending rather than capital markets to meet their financing needs. While generally acknowledging that the medium-term outlook for real GDP growth and employment had im- proved, participants continued to see the uncertainty surrounding that outlook as elevated. Participants agreed that the path of the economy depended signifi- cantly on the course of the virus and progress on vac- cinations. Many participants remarked that the pan- demic continued to pose considerable risks to the eco- nomic outlook, including risks associated with new virus strains, potential public resistance to vaccination, and potential difficulties in the production and distribution of vaccines. With regard to upside risks, some partici- pants pointed to the possibility that fiscal policy could turn out to be more expansionary than anticipated, that households could display greater willingness to spend out of accumulated savings than expected, or that wide- spread vaccinations and easing of social distancing could result in a more rapid boost to spending and employ- ment than anticipated. Participants generally viewed the risks to the outlook for inflation as having become more balanced than was the case over most of 2020, although most still viewed the risks as weighted to the downside. As an upside risk to inflation, several participants noted the potential for pandemic-related supply constraints to affect price inflation somewhat more than anticipated or for price increases among industries most adversely af- fected by the pandemic to be more pronounced than projected. A number of participants commented on issues related to financial stability. Several participants noted areas of strength. For example, the banking system had shown considerable resilience since the onset of the pandemic. Banks’ capital positions had generally remained solid, and earnings were strong. In addition, results from the most recent stress tests indicated that the largest banks could withstand very stressed economic conditions. That said, a few participants stated that it would be im- portant to stay vigilant to ensure that the banking system remained strong and resilient. In addition, several par- ticipants noted that the pandemic had highlighted struc- tural vulnerabilities in other parts of the financial system. These included run-prone investment funds in short- term funding and credit markets as well as fragilities in Treasury market functioning; stresses stemming from these vulnerabilities had required substantial interven- tion by the Federal Reserve in the turbulent market con- ditions at the onset of the pandemic. A couple of par- ticipants commented that it would be important for the appropriate regulatory bodies to address these financial stability vulnerabilities. Regarding asset valuations, some participants commented that equity valuations had risen further, that initial public offering activity was ele- vated, or that valuations might have been affected by re- tail investors trading through electronic platforms. In addition, risk spreads on corporate bonds and loans were generally low, even with corporate indebtedness having risen to high levels. A few participants noted that some CRE in sectors that had been most directly af- fected by the pandemic—such as those involving retail establishments and hotels—faced the prospect of falling prices and increased stress. In their consideration of monetary policy at this meeting, participants reaffirmed the Federal Reserve’s commit- ment to using its full range of tools to support the U.S. economy during this challenging time, thereby pro- moting the Committee’s statutory goals of maximum employment and price stability. Participants agreed that the path of the economy would depend significantly on the course of the virus, including progress on vaccina- tions, and that the ongoing public health crisis had con- tinued to weigh on economic activity, employment, and inflation. Participants noted that as the pandemic had worsened across the country in recent months, the pace of the recovery had moderated, with weakness concen- trated in the sectors most adversely affected by the pan- demic. In contrast, participants remarked that the pro- spect of an effective vaccine program, the recently en- acted fiscal support, and the potential for additional fis- cal actions had led them to judge that the medium-term outlook had improved. That said, participants agreed that the economy remained far from the Committee’s longer-run goals and that the path ahead remained highly uncertain, with the pandemic continuing to pose consid- erable risks to the outlook. In their discussion of the outlook for monetary policy, participants judged that maintaining a highly accommo- dative stance of policy was essential to foster further Page 16 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ economic recovery and to achieve an average inflation rate of 2 percent over time. Participants noted that eco- nomic conditions were currently far from the Commit- tee’s longer-run goals and that the stance for policy would need to remain accommodative until those goals were achieved. Consequently, all participants supported maintaining the Committee’s current settings and out- come-based guidance for the federal funds rate and the pace of asset purchases. Participants noted that the Committee’s current guid- ance was well suited to the current environment because it describes how policy would respond based on the path of the economy. For example, if progress toward the Committee’s goals proved slower than anticipated, the outcome-based guidance would convey the Committee’s intention to respond by increasing monetary policy ac- commodation through maintaining the current level of the target range of the federal funds rate for longer and raising the expected path of the Federal Reserve’s bal- ance sheet. In addition, participants noted that the Com- mittee’s current outcome-based guidance for both the federal funds rate and balance sheet appeared to be well understood by the public. In that context, participants emphasized that it was important to abstract from tem- porary factors affecting inflation—such as low past lev- els of prices dropping out of measures of annual price changes or relative price increases in some sectors brought about by supply constraints or disruptions—in judging whether inflation was on track to moderately ex- ceed 2 percent for some time. Participants noted that the increase in the Federal Re- serve’s balance sheet since last March had materially eased financial conditions and was providing substantial support to the economy. The Committee’s guidance for asset purchases indicated that asset purchases would continue at least at the current pace until substantial fur- ther progress toward its employment and inflation goals had been achieved. With the economy still far from those goals, participants judged that it was likely to take some time for substantial further progress to be achieved. Various participants noted the importance of the Committee clearly communicating its assessment of progress toward its longer-run goals well in advance of the time when it could be judged substantial enough to warrant a change in the pace of purchases. Committee Policy Action In their discussion of monetary policy for this meeting, members agreed that the COVID-19 pandemic was causing tremendous human and economic hardship across the United States and around the world. They noted that the pace of recovery in economic activity and employment had moderated in recent months, with weakness concentrated in sectors most adversely af- fected by the pandemic. Weaker demand and earlier de- clines in oil prices had been holding down consumer price inflation. Overall financial conditions remained ac- commodative, in part reflecting policy measures to sup- port the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. house- holds and businesses. Members also stated that the path of the economy would depend significantly on the course of the virus, including progress on vaccinations. In addition, members agreed that the ongoing public health crisis had continued to weigh on economic activ- ity, employment, and inflation and was posing consider- able risks to the economic outlook. Members agreed that the pandemic continued to pose considerable risks to the outlook. Nonetheless, in light of the expected progress on vaccinations and the change in the outlook for fiscal policy, the medium-term pro- spects for the economy had improved enough that members decided that the reference in previous post- meeting statements to risks to the economic outlook over the medium term was no longer warranted. Members agreed that the Federal Reserve was commit- ted to using its full range of tools to support the U.S. economy in this challenging time, thereby promoting its maximum-employment and price-stability goals. All members reaffirmed that, in accordance with the Com- mittee’s goals to achieve maximum employment and in- flation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run and with inflation running persistently below this longer-run goal, they would aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and longer-term inflation expecta- tions remain well anchored at 2 percent. Members ex- pected to maintain an accommodative stance of mone- tary policy until those outcomes were achieved. All members agreed to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent, and they expected that it would be appropriate to maintain this target range until labor market conditions had reached levels con- sistent with the Committee’s assessments of maximum employment and inflation had risen to 2 percent and was on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time. In addition, members agreed that it would be appropri- ate for the Federal Reserve to continue to increase its holdings of Treasury securities by at least $80 billion per month and agency mortgage-backed securities by at least $40 billion per month until substantial further progress _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Minutes of the Meeting of January 26–27, 2021 Page 17 had been made toward the Committee’s maximum-em- ployment and price-stability goals. They judged that these asset purchases would help foster smooth market functioning and accommodative financial conditions, thereby supporting the flow of credit to households and businesses. Members agreed that, in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, they would continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and that they would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate in the event that risks emerged that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals. Members also agreed that, in as- sessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, they would take into account a wide range of information, in- cluding readings on public health, labor market condi- tions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the fol- lowing domestic policy directive, for release at 2:00 p.m.: “Effective January 28, 2021, the Federal Open Market Committee directs the Desk to: • Undertake open market operations as nec- essary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of 0 to ¼ percent. • Increase the System Open Market Ac- count holdings of Treasury securities by $80 billion per month and of agency mort- gage-backed securities (MBS) by $40 bil- lion per month. • Increase holdings of Treasury securities and agency MBS by additional amounts and purchase agency commercial mort- gage-backed securities (CMBS) as needed to sustain smooth functioning of markets for these securities. • Conduct repurchase agreement operations to support effective policy implementation and the smooth functioning of short-term U.S. dollar funding markets. • Conduct overnight reverse repurchase agreement operations at an offering rate of 0.00 percent and with a per-counterparty limit of $30 billion per day; the per-coun- terparty limit can be temporarily increased at the discretion of the Chair. • Roll over at auction all principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of Treasury securities and reinvest all princi- pal payments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of agency debt and agency MBS in agency MBS. • Allow modest deviations from stated amounts for purchases and reinvestments, if needed for operational reasons. • Engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate set- tlement of the Federal Reserve’s agency MBS transactions.” The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below for release at 2:00 p.m.: “The Federal Reserve is committed to using its full range of tools to support the U.S. economy in this challenging time, thereby promoting its maximum employment and price stability goals. The COVID-19 pandemic is causing tremen- dous human and economic hardship across the United States and around the world. The pace of the recovery in economic activity and em- ployment has moderated in recent months, with weakness concentrated in the sectors most adversely affected by the pandemic. Weaker demand and earlier declines in oil prices have been holding down consumer price inflation. Overall financial conditions remain accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses. The path of the economy will depend signifi- cantly on the course of the virus, including pro- gress on vaccinations. The ongoing public health crisis continues to weigh on economic activity, employment, and inflation, and poses considerable risks to the economic outlook. The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 per- cent over the longer run. With inflation run- ning persistently below this longer-run goal, the Committee will aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so Page 18 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ that inflation averages 2 percent over time and longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent. The Committee ex- pects to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these outcomes are achieved. The Committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and expects it will be appropriate to maintain this target range until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee’s assessments of maximum em- ployment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time. In addition, the Federal Re- serve will continue to increase its holdings of Treasury securities by at least $80 billion per month and of agency mortgage-backed securi- ties by at least $40 billion per month until sub- stantial further progress has been made toward the Committee’s maximum employment and price stability goals. These asset purchases help foster smooth market functioning and ac- commodative financial conditions, thereby supporting the flow of credit to households and businesses. In assessing the appropriate stance of mone- tary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming infor- mation for the economic outlook. The Com- mittee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals. The Committee’s assess- ments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on public health, labor market conditions, inflation pres- sures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.” Voting for this action: Jerome H. Powell, John C. Williams, Thomas I. Barkin, Raphael W. Bostic, Michelle W. Bowman, Lael Brainard, Richard H. Clarida, Mary C. Daly, Charles L. Evans, Randal K. Quarles, and Christopher J. Waller. Voting against this action: None. Consistent with the Committee’s decision to leave the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged, the Board of Governors voted unanimously to leave the in- terest rates on required and excess reserve balances at 0.10 percent. The Board of Governors also voted unan- imously to approve establishment of the primary credit rate at the existing level of 0.25 percent, effective Janu- ary 28, 2021. It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Tuesday–Wednesday, March 16– 17, 2021. The meeting adjourned at 10:25 a.m. on Janu- ary 27, 2021. Notation Vote By notation vote completed on January 5, 2021, the Committee unanimously approved the minutes of the Committee meeting held on December 15–16, 2020. _______________________ James A.

The revised FOIA rules, which include a range of minor and technical updates, will become effective 30 days after the forthcoming pub- lication of the final rule in the Federal Register. Developments in Financial Markets and Open Market Operations The manager turned first to a discussion of financial market developments. In the United States, the trend toward higher longer-term yields observed in recent months accelerated over the intermeeting period, and far-forward real rates based on Treasury Inflation- Protected Securities (TIPS) rose considerably. Market participants highlighted an improving economic out- look, bolstered by passage of the American Rescue Plan (ARP) and progress on vaccinations, as underlying the increase in yields. Model- and survey-based estimates suggested that a significant portion of the increase in yields was associated with an increase in term premiums. Higher term premiums could reflect the outlook for more expansive fiscal policy and an associated upward revision in the expected path for Treasury debt out- standing. Increased uncertainty over the outlook for longer-term interest rates as well as technical factors may also have contributed to the rise in term premiums. The Treasury market functioned well over most of the pe- riod, although measures of market liquidity deteriorated somewhat toward the end of February. Conditions gradually improved, although some measures of market liquidity had not fully returned to earlier levels. Page 2 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Rates implied by interest rate futures maturing over the next several years rose notably over the intermeeting pe- riod, reportedly reflecting a reassessment by market par- ticipants of the expected path of the target range for the federal funds rate. Since the January meeting, the date of the first increase in the target range for the federal funds rate implied by a straight read of market pricing moved notably earlier to the first quarter of 2023, and the implied target rate at the end of 2023 rose around 50 basis points. However, responses to the Open Mar- ket Desk surveys suggested more modest changes to policy rate expectations. The probability-weighted mean survey expectation for the target rate at the end of 2023 rose only around 5 basis points. Expectations for economic conditions at the time of the first increase in the target range, as measured by the Desk surveys, appeared to remain broadly consistent with the Committee’s policy framework and forward guidance. Expectations from the Desk surveys for the path of asset purchases were little changed. Contacts noted that these expectations have been held steady by policymaker communications emphasizing both the need to see realized progress toward the Committee’s goals and the intent to communicate well in advance of the time when progress could be judged substantial enough to warrant a change in the pace of purchases. Alongside the rise in U.S. yields, broad U.S. equity price indexes increased moderately, with the largest gains in cyclically sensitive sectors. The rise in U.S. yields was also accompanied by increases in sovereign yields in other advanced economies. Some central banks re- sponded to these yield increases with adjustments to op- erations; others suggested that the rising yields reflected improvements in the outlook. The deputy manager discussed the evolution of the Fed- eral Reserve’s balance sheet and related developments in money markets. Reserve balances rose more than $400 billion, on net, over the intermeeting period to $3.7 trillion, while Treasury bills outstanding decreased more than $200 billion. Against this backdrop, the ef- fective federal funds rate softened modestly, while re- purchase agreement (repo) rates declined to a greater ex- tent. Moreover, market participants projected that re- serves would grow at a historically rapid pace in coming months, reflecting continued expansion of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet along with a projected draw- down in the balances maintained in the Treasury General Account. Market contacts suggested that continued rapid expansion of reserves could put further downward pressure on money market rates. The deputy manager noted that the earliest and most pronounced pressure was likely to be observed in overnight secured financing markets, and there could be increasing usage of the over- night reverse repurchase agreement (ON RRP) facility. In light of the potential for expanded use of the ON RRP facility, the staff had conducted a review to ensure that the terms of the facility and its counterparty base were well positioned to continue to support effective policy implementation. By offering a broad range of money market lenders an outside investment option, the ON RRP facility enhances lenders’ bargaining power in negotiating rates on short-term private investments and thus helps establish a floor on overnight money market rates. The facility can also alleviate downward pressure on overnight rates associated with reserve growth by broadening the range of liabilities that support the Fed- eral Reserve’s balance sheet expansion. The review rec- ommended raising the ON RRP per-counterparty limit from $30 billion to $80 billion. The $30 billion limit had been established a number of years ago, and the amount of credit intermediated through money markets had grown substantially since then. The increase in the limit to $80 billion would restore the capacity of the facility relative to the aggregate size of money fund counterpar- ties to roughly the level in place when the facility was established. The staff would also monitor money market conditions on an ongoing basis to assess whether any additional adjustments were needed to the ON RRP fa- cility terms. In addition to changes to the ON RRP parameters, the deputy manager also noted that the Federal Reserve could consider adjusting its administered rates if undue downward pressure on overnight rates emerged. Re- sponses to the Desk surveys indicated that many market participants anticipated adjustments to the interest on excess reserves rate and the ON RRP rate at or before the June meeting. Finally, in light of more normal con- ditions in agency commercial mortgage-backed securi- ties (CMBS) markets, the Desk planned to conduct agency CMBS operations as needed to sustain smooth market functioning but would cease regularly scheduled CMBS operations. In their discussion following the Desk briefings, partici- pants noted that the ON RRP facility had been very ef- fective in establishing a firm floor for the federal funds rate and supporting monetary policy implementation. Participants commented that the facility would continue to be an important part of the monetary policy imple- mentation framework going forward, particularly in Minutes of the Meeting of March 16–17, 2021 Page 3 _____________________________________________________________________________________________ coming months with reserve levels projected to rise rap- idly. Participants broadly supported the proposed in- crease in the counterparty limit, and a few participants also noted that they would support removing the limit altogether. A few participants suggested that some type of dynamic or differential limit could be considered in the future to enable the ON RRP facility to adapt more readily to market developments. A few participants noted that the concerns at the time the facility was es- tablished about possible adverse effects of the ON RRP facility on financial stability and the structure of money markets had not materialized. Indeed, over the spring of 2020, the facility played an important role in helping stabilize money market conditions. In light of the po- tential for greater use of the ON RRP facility going for- ward in connection with the expansion of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet and associated downward pres- sure on overnight rates, a couple of participants noted that it might be useful to review lessons learned regard- ing the ON RRP facility since its inception. Following the discussion, the Chair noted the potential for downward pressure on money market rates and sug- gested that, should undue downward pressure on over- night rates emerge, it might be appropriate to implement adjustments to administered rates at upcoming meetings or even between meetings to support effective policy im- plementation and ensure that the federal funds rate re- mains well within the target range. By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk’s domestic transactions over the intermeeting period. No intervention operations occurred in foreign currencies for the System’s account during the intermeeting period. Staff Review of the Economic Situation The COVID-19 pandemic and the measures undertaken to contain its spread continued to affect economic activ- ity in the United States and abroad. The information available at the time of the March 16–17 meeting sug- gested that U.S. real gross domestic product (GDP) was expanding in the first quarter of 2021 at a pace that was faster than in the fourth quarter of last year, although the level of real GDP had likely not yet returned to the level seen before the onset of the pandemic. Labor market conditions improved in January and February, but em- ployment was still well below its level at the start of 2020. Consumer price inflation through January—as measured by the 12-month percentage change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE)—re- mained well below 2 percent. Total nonfarm payroll employment increased solidly over January and February after softening at the end of last year. As of February, payroll employment had re- traced somewhat more than half of the losses seen since the onset of the pandemic. The unemployment rate fell to 6.2 percent in February. The unemployment rates for Hispanics and Asians declined, on balance, over January and February, while the unemployment rate for African Americans was unchanged on net; the rates for both Af- rican Americans and Hispanics remained well above the national average. Even though the labor force participa- tion rate edged down, the employment-to-population ra- tio moved up somewhat over January and February; both measures remained below their pre-pandemic lev- els. Initial claims for unemployment insurance in early March were at their lowest level since November of last year. Weekly estimates of private-sector payrolls con- structed by Federal Reserve Board staff using data pro- vided by the payroll processor ADP indicated that the four-week average increase in private employment at the end of February was about the same as it had been in the middle of the month, when the Bureau of Labor Statis- tics collects payroll employment data. Average hourly earnings for all employees rose 5.3 per- cent over the 12 months ending in February, and labor compensation per hour in the business sector increased 6.6 percent over the four quarters of 2020. The gains in both these measures, however, continued to be domi- nated by changes in the composition of the workforce. In particular, the concentration of job losses among lower-wage workers since early last year had resulted in outsized increases in average hourly earnings and com- pensation per hour that were not indicative of tight labor market conditions. By contrast, the employment cost index of total hourly compensation in the private sector rose 2.6 percent over the 12 months of last year, and a staff estimate of the 12-month change in the median wage derived from the ADP data was 3.2 percent in Jan- uary. These measures are likely to have been less af- fected by changes in workforce composition, and they were rising more slowly than their pre-pandemic pace. Total PCE price inflation was 1.5 percent over the 12 months ending in January and continued to be held down by slack in resource utilization. Core PCE price inflation, which excludes changes in consumer energy prices and many consumer food prices, also was 1.5 per- cent over the 12 months ending in January, while the trimmed mean measure of 12-month PCE inflation con- structed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas was 1.7 percent in January. In February, the 12-month change in the consumer price index (CPI) was 1.7 per- cent, while core CPI inflation was 1.3 percent over the same period. The latest readings on survey-based Page 4 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ measures of longer-run inflation expectations were little changed on balance. In early March, the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers preliminary measure for the next 5 to 10 years was the same as in the previous two months, while in February, the 3-year-ahead meas- ure of inflation expectations produced by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was essentially unchanged from its January level. The Survey of Professional Fore- casters measure of PCE price inflation over the next 10 years edged up in the first quarter, returning to its pre- pandemic level. A staff index of common inflation ex- pectations, which summarizes the co-movement of a wide variety of inflation expectations measures, was at about the same level in the fourth quarter of last year as in the third quarter. Consumer spending appeared to be increasing in the first quarter at a pace considerably faster, on balance, than in the fourth quarter of last year. Real PCE ex- panded strongly in January after declining over the pre- ceding two months, with spending likely boosted by fed- eral stimulus payments sent out in early January. The components of the nominal retail sales data used by the Bureau of Economic Analysis to estimate PCE pointed to a step-down in spending in February, but revised data for the previous month suggested an even stronger gain in January. Spending in March was expected to be boosted by additional federal stimulus payments from the ARP, which started to be distributed around the mid- dle of the month. In addition, the personal saving rate jumped to an even higher level in January, and ongoing gains in labor earnings along with further fiscal support pointed to additional increases in accumulated house- hold savings. Moreover, the preliminary reading of con- sumer sentiment from the Michigan survey moved up notably in early March to its highest level over the past year, reportedly reflecting the growing number of vac- cinations and the enactment of the ARP, although con- sumer sentiment remained below its levels from just be- fore the onset of the pandemic. Construction of single-family homes and home sales re- mained well above their pre-pandemic levels. However, the incoming data for this sector were mixed. Starts of single-family homes moved down notably over January and February, in part likely reflecting severe winter weather in February. Starts of multifamily units also fell in February but by less than the strong increase seen in January. Construction permits for single-family homes moved down, on net, over January and February, point- ing to some slowing in construction in coming months. Sales of both new and existing homes increased further in January, and home prices continued to rise briskly. Business investment in equipment and intangibles was continuing to increase in the first quarter after rising ap- preciably in the fourth quarter of last year. Nominal shipments of nondefense capital goods excluding air- craft expanded strongly in January, and rising orders for these goods pointed to further gains in business equip- ment spending in coming months. Business investment in the drilling and mining sector appeared to be increas- ing further after turning up sharply in the fourth quarter, as crude oil and natural gas rigs in operation—an indica- tor of drilling investment—continued to rise through early March with oil prices moving higher. Nominal nonresidential construction spending rose somewhat in January, but investment in nonresidential structures out- side of the drilling and mining sector looked to remain weak in the current quarter after declining further in the fourth quarter, reflecting continued hesitation by busi- nesses to commit to building projects with lengthy times to completion and uncertain future returns. Industrial production continued to rise solidly in January but then fell markedly in February, largely reflecting de- clines in manufacturing and mining sector output caused by severe winter weather in the south central region of the country in the middle of that month. Along with the severe weather, a cutback in the production of motor vehicles and parts also reflected a global shortage of semiconductors. New orders indexes in national and re- gional manufacturing surveys pointed toward solid in- creases in factory output in the coming months, al- though reports of shortages in materials and labor, as well as bottlenecks in transportation, signaled some po- tential restraints on the pace of the manufacturing recov- ery. Total real government purchases appeared to be rising in the first quarter after edging down in the fourth quar- ter. Although data through February indicated that de- fense spending was moving down, a likely bounceback in nondefense spending was expected to lift total federal purchases. State and local government purchases looked to be increasing, as the payrolls of these governments expanded, on net, over January and February, and nom- inal state and local construction spending increased sol- idly in January. Moreover, additional federal support for state and local governments included in the ARP, along with an improved outlook for state and local tax reve- nues, pointed to further notable increases in state and local purchases. Data for December and January showed a narrower nominal U.S. international trade deficit than in Novem- ber. Both imports and exports continued to rebound Minutes of the Meeting of March 16–17, 2021 Page 5 _____________________________________________________________________________________________ from their collapse in the first half of last year. Goods imports in January were much higher than a year earlier, with continued gains in most categories. Nominal goods exports in January nearly recovered to their level from a year earlier, with particular strength in exports of capital goods and industrial supplies. Services imports and ex- ports remained depressed, weighed down by the contin- ued suspension of most international travel. Recent data pointed to a slowdown in economic activity across foreign economies around the turn of the year, as tight social-distancing restrictions were imposed to rein in a new wave of COVID-19 infections in various parts of the world, most notably in Europe and Latin America. Even so, economies appeared to be better adapted to operating under restrictions than during previous waves of infections. Manufacturing activity continued to gen- erally outperform activity in the services sector, and manufactured exports from China and some other Asian economies remained strong, especially to the United States. Inflation rebounded in many foreign economies, reflecting rising energy prices and other temporary fac- tors. However, underlying inflationary pressures re- mained subdued. Staff Review of the Financial Situation Investors appeared to have become more optimistic about the economic outlook over the intermeeting pe- riod against the backdrop of progress on COVID-19 vaccinations, signs of stronger domestic spending, and additional fiscal stimulus. The nominal Treasury yield curve steepened markedly, largely because of increases in longer-term real yields, although measures of inflation compensation also increased further. Despite the spikes in equity market volatility early in the intermeeting pe- riod, spurred by heavy trading concentrated in a few spe- cific stocks and subsequent concerns over the rapid rise in longer-term interest rates, broad equity price indexes rose on net. Consistent with the stronger outlook, spreads on high-yield corporate bonds narrowed. Fi- nancing conditions for businesses with access to capital markets and households with high credit scores re- mained broadly accommodative, but conditions stayed tight for other borrowers. The Treasury yield curve steepened over the intermeet- ing period, with 5- and 10-year yields rising markedly. Measures of inflation compensation increased moder- ately, on net, continuing the trend observed over recent months. However, in contrast to recent months, most of the recent increase in longer-term Treasury yields was accounted for by higher TIPS-implied real yields. Mar- ket participants attributed the increases in longer-term yields in part to increased investor optimism about the economic outlook and expectations of higher Treasury debt issuance. On February 25, yields rose especially sharply. Market depth became thin, and bid-ask spreads widened, but Treasury market liquidity gradually recov- ered over the following days. Swaption-implied volatili- ties of longer-term interest rates rose notably. The expected path for the federal funds rate over the next few years, as implied by a straight read of overnight index swap quotes, rose substantially since the previous FOMC meeting and moved above 25 basis points in the first quarter of 2023, about three quarters sooner than expected at the time of the January meeting. Broad stock price indexes increased, on net, over the in- termeeting period, consistent with increased investor optimism about the economic outlook and the enact- ment of the ARP. Stocks in cyclically sensitive industries such as energy, banking, and small caps recorded sizable gains, while other sectors experienced mixed perfor- mance. One-month option-implied volatility on the S&P 500—the VIX—fluctuated over a wide range dur- ing the intermeeting period but moved lower on balance. Spreads of corporate bond yields over comparable- maturity Treasury yields were roughly unchanged on investment-grade corporate bonds but narrowed for speculative-grade bonds. Conditions in short-term funding markets remained sta- ble over the intermeeting period. Spreads on commer- cial paper and negotiable certificates of deposit across different tenors were little changed and remained near historically low levels. Assets under management (AUM) of government money market funds (MMFs) rose over the intermeeting period, whereas AUM of prime MMFs declined somewhat. The effective federal funds rate and the Secured Over- night Financing Rate averaged 7 basis points and 3 basis points, respectively, over the intermeeting period, de- creasing somewhat relative to the previous intermeeting period average amid a net decrease in Treasury bill issu- ance and rising reserves. There continued to be no par- ticipation in the Federal Reserve’s repo operations, but participation in the Federal Reserve’s ON RRP increased a little. Amid stable market conditions, there was no take-up in the Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Fa- cility or the Commercial Paper Funding Facility. Improved U.S. economic growth prospects and opti- mism about the eventual lifting of social-distancing and related restrictions globally were major drivers of asset prices abroad, spurring sizable increases in sovereign Page 6 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ yields in advanced foreign economies. In response to rising yields, the Reserve Bank of Australia increased its bond purchases, and the European Central Bank indi- cated it would increase the pace of its bond purchases going forward. The broad dollar index rose modestly, with more notable appreciation against currencies of emerging market economies (EMEs). EME sovereign spreads edged up, and flows into EME bond funds fell back later in the period amid the rise in yields in ad- vanced economies. However, flows into dedicated EME equity funds remained strong. Overall, foreign eq- uity indexes increased slightly in most major markets. Financing conditions for nonfinancial businesses in cap- ital markets remained broadly accommodative over the intermeeting period, supported by low interest rates and high equity valuations. Gross and net corporate bond issuances were solid in January and February. Gross is- suance of leveraged loans was strong in January, driven mainly by refinancing activity, as primary-market spreads compressed notably since the end of last year in re- sponse to strong investor demand for such loans. Eq- uity raised through traditional initial public offerings and seasoned equity offerings continued to be strong in Jan- uary and February, and initial equity offerings by special purpose acquisition companies remained exceptionally high. Commercial and industrial loans outstanding on banks’ balance sheets continued to decline through Feb- ruary as loan paydowns persisted and demand for new bank credit reportedly remained subdued. Corporate earnings continued to recover while the credit quality of nonfinancial corporations improved further. Corporate bond defaults declined in December and Jan- uary and reached levels substantially below their 2019 average. In addition, the volume of nonfinancial corpo- rate credit rating upgrades modestly outpaced down- grades over the first two months of 2021. Market indi- cators of future default expectations moved lower. Financing conditions for small businesses remained tight. Demand for loans remained depressed—and loan originations fell in December last year to about the same level seen in August—after the spike in lending associ- ated with the first round of the Paycheck Protection Pro- gram. Long-term delinquencies remained elevated rela- tive to recent years but were at levels significantly below those experienced during the Global Financial Crisis. Municipal market financing conditions stayed accom- modative over the intermeeting period. For commercial real estate (CRE) financed through cap- ital markets, financing conditions remained accommo- dative over the intermeeting period. Agency CMBS spreads narrowed further with strong issuance in De- cember and January. Spreads on non-agency CMBS also tightened, although triple-B spreads stayed at elevated levels compared with pre-pandemic levels. Issuance of non-agency CMBS remained weak relative to pre- pandemic levels. CRE loan growth at banks was weak, on net, through February, consistent with tight bank lending standards. Financing conditions in the residential mortgage market tightened somewhat over the intermeeting period but re- mained accommodative for stronger borrowers. Mort- gage rates for most borrowers increased but stayed near historically low levels, supporting elevated refinance and purchase activity through January. Credit was broadly available to higher-score borrowers meeting standard conforming loan criteria but tightened further for bor- rowers with lower credit scores. The share of mortgages in forbearance was unchanged. Financing conditions in consumer credit markets re- mained generally accommodative for borrowers with strong credit scores but were still tight for those with nonprime scores. Auto loan balances continued to grow in January, while credit card balances declined. Interest rates on new credit card offers to borrowers with prime credit scores continued to trend down, on net, through December. In contrast, offer rates to nonprime borrow- ers rose further. Conditions in the asset-backed securi- ties market were stable during the intermeeting period. Staff Economic Outlook The U.S. economic projection prepared by the staff for the March FOMC meeting was considerably stronger than the January forecast. Real GDP growth appeared to be picking up at the beginning of this year by more than the staff had expected, likely reflecting both a faster-than-anticipated easing in social distancing and a more rapid response by households to the fiscal support package enacted in late December. Moreover, the size of the ARP enacted in March was considerably larger than what the staff had assumed in the January projec- tion. All told, real GDP growth was projected to be sub- stantial this year and the unemployment rate was fore- cast to decline markedly, as the staff’s projection also continued to anticipate that widespread vaccination would allow for further easing in social distancing this year. Real GDP growth was expected to step down in 2022 and 2023 but still outpace that of potential over this period, leading to a decline in the unemployment rate to historically low levels, as monetary policy was as- sumed to remain highly accommodative. Minutes of the Meeting of March 16–17, 2021 Page 7 _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Incoming data on inflation were a little above what the staff had expected. The 12-month changes in total and core PCE prices were expected to transitorily move above 2 percent in coming months, as the low inflation readings from the spring of last year dropped out of the calculation window. In addition, inflation was forecast to be temporarily boosted this year by the expected emergence of some production bottlenecks and supply constraints. Following the transitory increase this year, inflation was projected to run a bit below 2 percent next year and then to reach 2 percent by 2023, reflecting tight resource utilization in product and labor markets. The staff continued to see the uncertainty surrounding the outlook as elevated. Moreover, the uncertain course of the pandemic, particularly the emergence of more- contagious strains of the coronavirus in the United States and elsewhere, was still viewed as tilting the risks to the economic outlook to the downside. However, given the resilience of the economy in the face of the earlier surge in new COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths and the magnitude of fiscal support enacted, the downside risks to the economic outlook were seen as smaller than for the previous projection. The staff viewed the risks of upside inflationary pressures as hav- ing increased since the previous forecast and now saw the risks to the inflation projection as balanced. Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, participants submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and infla- tion for each year from 2021 through 2023 and over the longer run, based on their individual assessments of ap- propriate monetary policy, including the path of the fed- eral funds rate. The longer-run projections represented each participant’s assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, un- der appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy. A Summary of Eco- nomic Projections was released to the public following the conclusion of the meeting. In their discussion of current conditions, participants noted that the COVID-19 pandemic was causing tre- mendous human and economic hardship across the United States and around the world. Following a mod- eration in the pace of the recovery, indicators of eco- nomic activity and employment had turned up recently, although the sectors most adversely affected by the pan- demic remained weak. Inflation continued to run below 2 percent. Overall financial conditions remained accom- modative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses. Participants noted that the path of the economy would depend significantly on the course of the virus, including progress on vaccinations, and that the ongoing public health crisis would continue to weigh on economic activity, employment, and inflation and posed considerable risks to the economic outlook. Participants observed that the pace of the economic re- covery had picked up recently and that the economy continued to show resilience in the face of the pandemic. They noted encouraging developments regarding the pandemic, including significant declines in the number of new cases, hospitalizations, and deaths over the inter- meeting period as well as a pickup in the pace of vac- cinations. In light of these developments as well as the extent of the recent fiscal policy support, participants significantly revised up their projections for real GDP growth this year compared with the projections they submitted last December. They noted, however, that economic activity and employment were currently well below levels consistent with maximum employment. Participants observed that the economic downturn had not fallen equally on all Americans and that lower- income and Black and Hispanic households had been disproportionately affected by the pandemic. A number of participants stressed that recently enacted fiscal sup- port would help address some of the hardships faced by these groups and that monetary policy would also help by promoting the economy’s return to the Committee’s goals of broad-based and inclusive maximum employ- ment and price stability. Participants observed that household spending had risen notably so far this year and anticipated that further gains in consumer spending would contribute significantly to the economic recovery. While household spending on services that typically require close personal contact re- mained weak, participants expected spending on these services would improve as vaccinations became more widespread, social-distancing measures were relaxed, and the public became less wary of close personal inter- actions. Participants anticipated consumer spending would be bolstered by the recently enacted fiscal stimu- lus packages as well as by accommodative monetary pol- icy. Many participants also pointed to the elevated level of household savings and judged that the release of pent- up demand could boost consumption growth further as social distancing waned. Participants also observed that residential construction continued to be solid and home Page 8 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ sales remained robust in part because of low interest rates. Low inventory was viewed as an important factor supporting strong gains in housing prices. With respect to the business sector, participants ob- served that business equipment investment had contin- ued to increase and that readings on new orders and shipments of capital goods remained strong. While some District contacts continued to report that firms in industries such as CRE or leisure, travel, and hospitality were struggling from pandemic-related social distancing, other District contacts reported that activity in these in- dustries had started to improve. Participants noted that surveys of business activity had picked up recently and that many District contacts were growing increasingly optimistic about business prospects given ongoing pro- gress on vaccinations. Participants also discussed re- ports of shortages in materials, key intermediate inputs, and labor as well as bottlenecks in shipping. A few par- ticipants noted that higher crop prices were continuing to boost income in the agricultural sector. Several par- ticipants judged that the support provided by the ARP could improve the financial positions of small firms that had been adversely affected by the pandemic. Participants observed that labor market conditions had improved recently, as payroll employment registered strong gains in February and the unemployment rate fell to 6.2 percent. Even so, payroll employment was about 9.5 million jobs below its pre-pandemic level, and labor market conditions for those in the most disadvantaged communities were viewed as lagging behind those of other households. Moreover, participants noted that employment in the leisure and hospitality sector was still down substantially from its pre-pandemic level despite a sharp rebound in February. Participants generally ex- pected strong job gains to continue over coming months and into the medium term, supported by accommoda- tive fiscal and monetary policies as well as by continued progress on vaccinations, further reopening of sectors most affected by the pandemic, and the associated re- covery in economic activity. However, participants noted that the economy was far from achieving the Committee’s broad-based and inclusive goal of maxi- mum employment. Some participants commented that labor force participation continued to be held down by workers’ health concerns and additional childcare re- sponsibilities associated with virtual schooling and that the pace of recovery in the labor market would depend importantly on how rapidly those affected by these is- sues could rejoin the labor force. Several participants noted that the speed of the labor market recovery also depended on factors such as the movement of workers across industries and occupations in a restructuring economy or the effects of technological change on the demand for labor. Several participants suggested that the ARP could hasten the recovery, which could help limit longer-term damage in labor markets caused by the pandemic. Participants observed that headline PCE inflation con- tinued to run below 2 percent. In the near term, the 12-month change in PCE prices was expected to move above 2 percent as the low inflation readings from the spring of last year drop out of the calculation. Most par- ticipants also pointed to supply constraints that could contribute to price increases for some goods in coming months as the economy continued to reopen. After the transitory effects of these factors fade, however, partici- pants generally anticipated that annual inflation readings would edge down next year. Subsequently, participants expected that inflation would likely move along a trajec- tory consistent with achieving the Committee’s objec- tives over time, supported by strong aggregate demand, which participants expected would be driven in part by accommodative monetary and fiscal policies. Participants discussed market- and survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations and their implications for the inflation outlook. Market-based measures of inflation compensation at the 5- and 10-year horizons had continued to move up over the intermeet- ing period, while survey-based measures of inflation ex- pectations were little changed on balance. A number of participants indicated that the increases in market-based measures of inflation compensation from the very low levels of last spring were consistent with the view that inflation was likely to move along a path over time con- sistent with the Committee’s goals. Participants noted that overall financial conditions re- mained highly accommodative, in part reflecting the stance of monetary policy. Participants commented on the notable rise in longer-term Treasury yields that oc- curred over the intermeeting period and generally viewed it as reflecting the improved economic outlook, some firming in inflation expectations, and expectations for increased Treasury debt issuance. Disorderly condi- tions in Treasury markets or a persistent rise in yields that could jeopardize progress toward the Committee’s goals were seen as cause for concern. While overall fi- nancial conditions were still seen as accommodative, a number of participants remarked that financing condi- tions remained challenging for many small businesses. A Minutes of the Meeting of March 16–17, 2021 Page 9 _____________________________________________________________________________________________ couple of participants expressed concern that highly ac- commodative financial conditions could lead to exces- sive risk-taking and the buildup of financial imbalances. While generally acknowledging that the medium-term outlook for real GDP growth and employment had im- proved, participants continued to see the uncertainty surrounding that outlook as elevated. Participants agreed that the path of the economy would depend sig- nificantly on the course of the virus, including progress on vaccinations. Most participants indicated that the pandemic continued to pose considerable risks to the economic outlook, including risks associated with new more-contagious virus strains, obstacles in getting suffi- cient numbers of the public vaccinated, or social- distancing fatigue. A few participants pointed to risks associated with stress in the CRE sector or to risks asso- ciated with the unwinding of mortgage forbearance and eviction moratoriums provided to households. With re- gard to upside risks, some participants pointed to the possibility that fiscal policy could have a more expan- sionary effect than anticipated, that households could display a greater-than-expected willingness to spend out of accumulated savings, or that widespread vaccinations and easing of social distancing could result in a more rapid boost to spending and employment than antici- pated. Most participants noted that they viewed the risks to the outlook for inflation as broadly balanced. Several re- marked that supply disruptions and strong demand could push up price inflation more than anticipated. Several participants commented that the factors that had contributed to low inflation during the previous expan- sion could again exert more downward pressure on in- flation than expected. In their consideration of the stance of monetary policy, participants reaffirmed the Federal Reserve’s commit- ment to using its full range of tools to support the U.S. economy during this challenging time, thereby promot- ing the Committee’s statutory goals of maximum em- ployment and price stability. Participants noted that in- dicators of economic activity and employment had turned up recently after a period of moderation, al- though the sectors most adversely affected by the pan- demic remained weak. Despite these positive indicators and an improved public health situation, participants agreed that the economy remained far from the Com- mittee’s longer-run goals and that the path ahead re- mained highly uncertain, with the pandemic continuing to pose considerable risks to the outlook. Consequently, participants judged that the current stance of policy and policy guidance remained appropriate to foster further economic recovery as well as to achieve inflation that av- erages 2 percent over time and longer-term inflation ex- pectations that remain well anchored at 2 percent. Participants judged that the Committee’s current guid- ance for the federal funds rate and asset purchases was serving the economy well. They noted that a benefit of the outcome-based guidance was that it did not need to be recalibrated often in response to incoming data or the evolving outlook. Participants also noted the im- portance of communicating to the public that the exist- ing guidance, together with the new monetary policy framework as delineated in the revised Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, meant that the path of the federal funds rate and the balance sheet depend on actual progress toward reaching the Committee’s maximum-employment and inflation goals. In particular, various participants noted that changes in the path of policy should be based primarily on observed outcomes rather than forecasts. Participants agreed that overall financial conditions were accommodative. They noted that the Federal Reserve’s asset purchases since last March had materially eased fi- nancial conditions and were providing substantial sup- port to the economy. Participants noted that it would likely be some time until substantial further progress to- ward the Committee’s maximum-employment and price-stability goals would be realized and that, con- sistent with the Committee’s outcome-based guidance, asset purchases would continue at least at the current pace until then. A number of participants highlighted the importance of the Committee clearly communicating its assessment of progress toward its longer-run goals well in advance of the time when it could be judged sub- stantial enough to warrant a change in the pace of asset purchases. The timing of such communications would depend on the evolution of the economy and the pace of progress toward the Committee’s goals. Committee Policy Action In their discussion of monetary policy for this meeting, members agreed that the COVID-19 pandemic was causing tremendous human and economic hardship across the United States and around the world. They noted that following a moderation in the pace of the re- covery, indicators of economic activity and employment had turned up recently, although the sectors most ad- versely affected by the pandemic remained weak. Infla- tion continued to run below 2 percent. Overall financial conditions remained accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of Page 10 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ credit to U.S. households and businesses. Members also remarked that the path of the economy would depend significantly on the course of the virus, including pro- gress on vaccinations. In addition, members agreed that the ongoing public health crisis continued to weigh on economic activity, employment, and inflation and was posing considerable risks to the economic outlook. Members agreed that the Federal Reserve was commit- ted to using its full range of tools to support the U.S. economy in this challenging time, thereby promoting its maximum-employment and price-stability goals. All members reaffirmed that, in accordance with the Com- mittee’s goals to achieve maximum employment and in- flation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run and with inflation running persistently below this longer-run goal, they would aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and longer-term inflation expecta- tions remain well anchored at 2 percent. Members ex- pected to maintain an accommodative stance of mone- tary policy until those outcomes were achieved. All members agreed to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent, and they expected that it would be appropriate to maintain this target range until labor market conditions had reached levels con- sistent with the Committee’s assessments of maximum employment and inflation had risen to 2 percent and was on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time. In addition, members agreed that it would be appropri- ate for the Federal Reserve to continue to increase its holdings of Treasury securities by at least $80 billion per month and agency mortgage-backed securities by at least $40 billion per month until substantial further progress had been made toward the Committee’s maximum- employment and price-stability goals. They judged that these asset purchases would help foster smooth market functioning and accommodative financial conditions, thereby supporting the flow of credit to households and businesses. Members agreed that, in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, they would continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and that they would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate in the event that risks emerged that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals. Members also agreed that, in as- sessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, they would take into account a wide range of information, in- cluding readings on public health, labor market condi- tions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments. With regard to the postmeeting statement, in light of the notably positive tone of recent data, members judged that it was appropriate to incorporate that development in the description of the economic situation with the lan- guage that “indicators of economic activity and employ- ment have turned up recently.” Members also deter- mined that, with oil prices having essentially retraced their pandemic-related declines, it was appropriate to re- move the reference to oil prices as a factor holding down consumer price inflation and to simply state that “infla- tion continues to run below 2 percent.” Regarding the directive to the Desk, members agreed that the directive should incorporate the proposed increase in the per- counterparty limit for the ON RRP facility to $80 billion. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Open Market Account in ac- cordance with the following domestic policy directive, for release at 2:00 p.m.: “Effective March 18, 2021, the Federal Open Market Committee directs the Desk to: • Undertake open market operations as nec- essary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of 0 to ¼ percent. • Increase the System Open Market Ac- count holdings of Treasury securities by $80 billion per month and of agency mort- gage-backed securities (MBS) by $40 bil- lion per month. • Increase holdings of Treasury securities and agency MBS by additional amounts and purchase agency commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) as needed to sustain smooth functioning of markets for these securities. • Conduct repurchase agreement operations to support effective policy implementation and the smooth functioning of short-term U.S. dollar funding markets. • Conduct overnight reverse repurchase agreement operations at an offering rate of 0.00 percent and with a per-counterparty limit of $80 billion per day; the per- Minutes of the Meeting of March 16–17, 2021 Page 11 _____________________________________________________________________________________________ counterparty limit can be temporarily in- creased at the discretion of the Chair. • Roll over at auction all principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of Treasury securities and reinvest all princi- pal payments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of agency debt and agency MBS in agency MBS. • Allow modest deviations from stated amounts for purchases and reinvestments, if needed for operational reasons. • Engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settle- ment of the Federal Reserve’s agency MBS transactions.” The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below for release at 2:00 p.m.: “The Federal Reserve is committed to using its full range of tools to support the U.S. economy in this challenging time, thereby promoting its maximum employment and price stability goals. The COVID-19 pandemic is causing tremen- dous human and economic hardship across the United States and around the world. Following a moderation in the pace of the recovery, indi- cators of economic activity and employment have turned up recently, although the sectors most adversely affected by the pandemic remain weak. Inflation continues to run below 2 per- cent. Overall financial conditions remain ac- commodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses. The path of the economy will depend signifi- cantly on the course of the virus, including pro- gress on vaccinations. The ongoing public health crisis continues to weigh on economic activity, employment, and inflation, and poses considerable risks to the economic outlook. The Committee seeks to achieve maximum em- ployment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. With inflation running per- sistently below this longer-run goal, the Com- mittee will aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent. The Committee expects to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these outcomes are achieved. The Com- mittee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and expects it will be appropriate to maintain this target range until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee’s assessments of maximum employment and in- flation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time. In addition, the Federal Reserve will continue to increase its holdings of Treasury securities by at least $80 billion per month and of agency mortgage-backed securities by at least $40 bil- lion per month until substantial further progress has been made toward the Committee’s maxi- mum employment and price stability goals. These asset purchases help foster smooth mar- ket functioning and accommodative financial conditions, thereby supporting the flow of credit to households and businesses. In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals. The Committee’s assessments will take into account a wide range of information, in- cluding readings on public health, labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation ex- pectations, and financial and international de- velopments.” Voting for this action: Jerome H. Powell, John C. Williams, Thomas I. Barkin, Raphael W. Bostic, Michelle W. Bowman, Lael Brainard, Richard H. Clarida, Mary C. Daly, Charles L. Evans, Randal K. Quarles, and Christopher J. Waller. Voting against this action: None. Consistent with the Committee’s decision to leave the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged, the Board of Governors voted unanimously to leave the in- terest rates on required and excess reserve balances at 0.10 percent. The Board of Governors also voted unan- imously to approve establishment of the primary credit rate at the existing level of 0.25 percent, effective March 18, 2021.

Financial conditions eased modestly as market participants continued to focus on progress toward economic reopening as well as support- ive monetary and fiscal policy. Equity prices rose, with the S&P 500 index reaching a record high, while Treas- ury yields, the dollar, and credit spreads declined mod- estly. The equity gains were broad based across sectors, though shares of small caps, as captured by the Russell 2000 index, declined. News regarding losses associated with a highly levered family investment office affected the equity prices of some large financial firms, but the broader financial market effects appeared limited. After rising sharply in recent months, longer-term Treas- ury yields declined modestly over the intermeeting pe- riod, even as market expectations for U.S. growth con- tinued to be revised higher. Contacts reported that the earlier increases in yields drew in a range of investors, including foreign institutions, pension funds, and insur- ance companies. Against this backdrop, term premiums as measured by term structure models and based on es- Page 2 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ timates using the Open Market Desk’s surveys of pri- mary dealers and market participants moved slightly lower. Nonetheless, market participants were attentive to the potential for rising yields going forward, and, in recent months, Desk survey respondents had increased the probability they attach to higher yields at the end of 2021. Regarding expectations for the policy outlook, the mar- ket- and survey-implied paths of the federal funds rate were both relatively little changed over the intermeeting period, and the modal survey path in later years contin- ued to imply that the target range would gradually in- crease to a level just over 2 percent in 2026. Expecta- tions for the path of asset purchases were also stable, and market participants remained focused on the Commit- tee’s communications about progress toward its goals. According to the median survey responses, the Federal Reserve’s net purchases of Treasury and agency securi- ties were expected to end three quarters after the first reduction in the pace of asset purchases, and the first increase in the target range for the federal funds rate was expected to occur three quarters after that. Recent financial market developments across advanced economies reflected differing expectations for economic growth and monetary policy. Some countries that were expected to recoup COVID-19-related output losses earlier than others had seen larger yield increases and more appreciation in their currencies in recent months. Over the intermeeting period, the Bank of Canada an- nounced a reduction in the pace of its asset purchases and brought forward its forecast of when conditions would be met for an increase in its policy rate. The manager turned next to money markets and the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet. Reserve balances in- creased further this intermeeting period to a record level of $3.9 trillion. The effective federal funds rate was steady at 7 basis points. However, amid ongoing strong demand for safe short-term investments and reduced Treasury bill supply, the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) stood at 1 basis point throughout the pe- riod. The overnight reverse repurchase agreement (ON RRP) facility continued to effectively support pol- icy implementation, and take-up peaked at more than $100 billion. A modest amount of trading in overnight repurchase agreement (repo) markets occurred at nega- tive rates, although this development appeared to largely reflect technical factors. The SOMA manager noted that downward pressure on overnight rates in coming months could result in conditions that warrant consider- ation of a modest adjustment to administered rates and could ultimately lead to a greater share of Federal Re- serve balance sheet expansion being channeled into ON RRP and other Federal Reserve liabilities. Although few survey respondents expected an adjustment to ad- ministered rates at the current meeting, more than half expected an adjustment by the end of the June FOMC meeting. The manager concluded with an update on three opera- tional issues. Following the review of the ON RRP fa- cility discussed at the previous meeting, the Desk planned to relax counterparty eligibility criteria for money funds and government-sponsored enterprises in order to allow smaller counterparties of these types to participate. The Desk also planned to make modest ad- justments to the allocation of Treasury outright pur- chases across maturity ranges to ensure that purchases remain roughly proportional to the outstanding amounts of Treasury securities. These minor technical adjust- ments would have no implications for the effects of the Federal Reserve’s asset purchases on overall financial conditions. Finally, the manager requested that the Committee vote to maintain the standing U.S. dollar and foreign currency liquidity swap arrangements and to re- new the reciprocal currency arrangements with Canada and Mexico under the North American Framework Agreement. The Committee voted unanimously to renew the recip- rocal currency arrangements with the Bank of Canada and the Bank of Mexico; these arrangements are associ- ated with the Federal Reserve’s participation in the North American Framework Agreement of 1994. In ad- dition, the Committee voted unanimously to renew the dollar and foreign currency liquidity swap arrangements with the Bank of Canada, the Bank of England, the Bank of Japan, the European Central Bank, and the Swiss Na- tional Bank. The votes to renew the Federal Reserve’s participation in these standing arrangements occur an- nually at the April or May FOMC meeting. By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk’s domestic transactions over the intermeeting period. There were no intervention operations in foreign curren- cies for the System’s account during the intermeeting pe- riod. Discussion of Repurchase Agreement Arrange- ments The staff briefed participants on the Federal Reserve’s experience with the daily repo operations with primary dealers that have been in place since September 2019 and the temporary Foreign and International Monetary Authorities (FIMA) Repo Facility established in March _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Minutes of the Meeting of April 27–28, 2021 Page 3 last year. The briefing also reviewed considerations that could be relevant for policymakers’ judgments regarding whether these arrangements should become permanent standing facilities. The staff noted that repo operations have been a useful tool in controlling the federal funds rate by adding reserves to ensure that they remain ample and by limiting pressures in repo markets that could spill over into unsecured markets. In March 2020, repo op- erations worked in concert with other measures to man- age shocks to financial markets by stabilizing Treasury market conditions. Since June 2020, when the rate on overnight repo operations was raised relative to the rate of interest on excess reserves, repo operations have served as a backstop and there has been no substantive usage. Regarding considerations concerning a perma- nent standing repo facility, the briefing noted that stand- ing repo operations could be viewed as useful in fore- stalling funding strains that could spill over into other overnight markets and limit dealers’ intermediation ac- tivity in financial markets. However, a standing repo fa- cility could be seen as a form of liquidity support for nonbank financial institutions, and one that could create incentives for firms with access to the facility to take on more liquidity risk against eligible securities than would otherwise be the case. In discussing considerations for the establishment of a standing FIMA repo facility, the staff noted that such a facility could limit the propensity for foreign official institutions to execute large sales of U.S. Treasury securities in a stress environment that, in turn, could exacerbate strains in broader U.S. domestic financial markets. The briefing also noted some poten- tial drawbacks of such a facility, including less transpar- ency regarding its operations relative to other Federal Reserve facilities. In their discussion of considerations related to the estab- lishment of a standing repo facility as part of the Com- mittee’s overall approach to policy implementations in an ample reserves regime, a substantial majority of par- ticipants saw the potential benefits of an appropriately calibrated facility as outweighing the potential costs. Nearly all participants commented that a standing repo facility, by acting as a backstop, could help address pres- sures in the markets for U.S. Treasury securities and Treasury repo that could spill over to other funding mar- kets and impair the implementation and transmission of monetary policy. In this regard, a number of participants noted the potential for pressures in short-term funding markets to arise from time to time, even with monetary policy operating in an ample-reserves regime. Many par- ticipants noted that a standing facility could provide a timely and automatic response to incipient market pres- sures; they remarked that such pressures can be difficult to anticipate and, as a result, might not be as promptly addressed with discretionary operations. A few partici- pants noted that a standing repo facility could provide counterparties with additional flexibility in managing the composition of their holdings of high-quality liquid as- sets, potentially reducing the demand for reserves. A few participants cautioned that establishing a standing repo facility should not be viewed as a way of imple- menting monetary policy without an ample supply of re- serves. A couple of participants remarked that most of the benefits of a standing repo facility could be realized by the Federal Reserve maintaining readiness to conduct repo operations on short notice as needed, noting that such an arrangement could avoid some of the costs of a standing facility. A few participants mentioned that a standing repo facility could be perceived as a means of supporting the financing of the U.S. Treasury or as a per- manent Federal Reserve liquidity backstop for nonde- pository institutions; a couple of others called out the risk that such a facility could crowd out private market sources of liquidity provision. Participants noted that it would be important to carefully consider key design elements of a potential standing repo facility, including the pricing structure, counterpar- ties, and range of collateral accepted. A number of par- ticipants commented that the counterparties at such a fa- cility should include depository institutions. Several par- ticipants noted the facility’s design should be targeted specifically to enhance control of the federal funds rate rather than to limit volatility in the repo market. In their discussion of considerations related to the estab- lishment of a permanent FIMA repo facility, a vast ma- jority of participants saw the potential benefits as out- weighing the costs. Participants highlighted a number of benefits of a standing FIMA repo facility, with many noting that it could support smoother functioning in U.S. Treasury securities markets and U.S. financial mar- kets more broadly by providing foreign official holders of U.S. Treasury securities with an alternative to outright sales of these securities in times of market stress. A few participants noted that, had a FIMA repo facility been in place in March 2020, it likely would have significantly damped pressures in these markets caused by the abrupt need for dollar funding abroad. Several participants sug- gested that a standing FIMA repo facility could be viewed as complementing the existing dollar swap lines by extending access to dollar funding for a broader range of central banks and foreign official institutions. Partic- ipants also commented on some potential risks of a Page 4 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ standing FIMA repo facility, including less transparency in connection with FIMA repo operations relative to other Federal Reserve facilities. Staff Review of the Economic Situation The COVID-19 pandemic and the measures undertaken to contain its spread continued to affect economic activ- ity in the United States and abroad. The information available at the time of the April 27–28 meeting sug- gested that U.S. real gross domestic product (GDP) had increased in the first quarter of 2021 at a pace that was faster than in the fourth quarter of last year but had not yet returned to its pre-pandemic level. Labor market conditions improved markedly in March, though em- ployment remained well below its level at the start of 2020. Consumer price inflation through February—as measured by the 12-month percentage change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE)—continued to run well below 2 percent. Total nonfarm payroll employment surged in March, with a notable gain in the leisure and hospitality sector. As of March, payroll employment had retraced almost two-thirds of the losses seen at the onset of the pan- demic. The unemployment rate declined to 6 percent in March, as the number of workers on temporary layoff continued to fall and the number on permanent layoff ticked down. Although the unemployment rates for Af- rican Americans and Hispanics fell, both rates remained well above the national average; in addition, the Asian unemployment rate moved up and was equal to the na- tional average in March. The labor force participation rate and employment-to-population ratio increased in March, though both measures remained below their pre- pandemic levels. Initial claims for unemployment insur- ance had moved down, on net, since mid-March and were at the lowest level since the beginning of the pan- demic, though they remained exceptionally high by pre- pandemic standards. Weekly estimates of private-sector payrolls constructed by Federal Reserve Board staff us- ing data provided by the payroll processor ADP, which were available through the first half of April, suggested that the rate of increase in private employment had slowed somewhat relative to its earlier robust pace. Average hourly earnings for all employees rose 4.2 per- cent over the 12 months ending in March. The 12-month change in average hourly earnings continued to be influenced by the effect of the pandemic on the composition of the workforce; in particular, the concen- tration of job losses among lower-wage workers since early last year had resulted in large increases in this meas- ure that were not indicative of tight labor market condi- tions. By contrast, a staff measure of the 12-month change in the median wage derived from the ADP data was 3.1 percent in March and continued to run below its pre-pandemic pace; this measure had likely been less af- fected by shifts in the composition of the workforce. Total PCE price inflation was 1.6 percent over the 12 months ending in February and continued to be held down by low rates of resource utilization. Core PCE price inflation, which excludes changes in consumer en- ergy prices and many consumer food prices, was 1.4 per- cent over the 12 months ending in February, while the trimmed mean measure of 12-month PCE inflation con- structed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas was 1.6 percent in February. In March, the 12-month change in the consumer price index (CPI) was 2.6 percent, boosted by increases in consumer energy prices, while core CPI inflation was 1.6 percent over the same period. In the first quarter of 2021, the staff’s common inflation expectations index, which combines information from many indicators of inflation expectations and inflation compensation, had returned to the level that prevailed in 2018. Real PCE declined in February; however, available indi- cators—including the components of the nominal retail sales data used to estimate PCE—pointed to a large in- crease in March and for the first quarter as a whole, with federal stimulus payments having likely supported the March increase. Housing starts bounced back in March following a weather-induced decline in February. Al- though existing home sales fell in February and March, the declines appeared to reflect continued limited avail- ability of homes for sale rather than weakening demand; in addition, February’s drop in new home sales was re- traced in March. Available indicators suggested that equipment and intan- gibles investment had increased in the first quarter of 2021, though at a slower pace than that seen in the fourth quarter of 2020. Likewise, drilling investment ap- peared to have moved up, boosted in part by higher en- ergy prices. However, investment in nonresidential structures outside of the drilling and mining sector looked as though it had declined further in the first quar- ter, likely reflecting ongoing uncertainty about the longer-term effects of the pandemic on businesses. Manufacturing output rebounded strongly in March fol- lowing weather-related disruptions to production in February. The March rise in factory output occurred de- spite lingering supply constraints; for example, weather- _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Minutes of the Meeting of April 27–28, 2021 Page 5 damaged facilities in Texas used to produce petrochem- ical and plastic materials had not yet been fully repaired, and semiconductor shortages were still weighing on mo- tor vehicle production. Total real government purchases appeared to have moved up in the first quarter after having declined over the second half of 2020. Available data suggested that a jump in federal nondefense purchases had offset a de- cline in defense purchases; in addition, indicators of real state and local purchases pointed to a small first-quarter increase. Data for February showed a wider nominal U.S. interna- tional trade deficit than in January. Both imports and exports fell from their January levels, the first nominal decline in each since last May. Goods imports were held back in February by weakness in imports for automotive products and consumer goods but remained higher than their pre-pandemic level. Nominal goods exports in February were weak in most categories and were still be- low their pre-pandemic level. Imports and exports of services remained depressed, weighed down by the con- tinued suspension of most international travel. Incoming data were consistent with a sharp slowdown in foreign economic growth in the first quarter, follow- ing a tightening of social-distancing restrictions to con- tain new waves of COVID-19 infections. Nevertheless, the slowdown appeared less severe than observed de- clines in mobility would have suggested, underscoring that foreign economies continued to adapt to public health restrictions. The most recent indicators showed that economic activity in many advanced foreign econo- mies (AFEs) resumed expanding toward the end of the first quarter amid a partial easing of restrictions. How- ever, a new surge in infections in several countries in Latin America and South Asia, notably India, under- scored the fragility of the global recovery. Foreign head- line inflation rose considerably, boosted by temporary factors, such as the fading effects of steep price declines seen early last year and the pass-through of price in- creases for oil and other commodities. However, under- lying inflationary pressures appeared to have remained muted. Staff Review of the Financial Situation Investor sentiment improved over the intermeeting pe- riod, reflecting a pickup in the pace of vaccinations, pro- spects for infrastructure spending, and stronger-than-ex- pected labor market and retail sales data. Domestic eq- uity prices increased notably amid declining equity mar- ket volatility, and corporate bond spreads narrowed. The nominal Treasury yield curve was little changed, as were measures of inflation compensation. A straight read of overnight index swap quotes suggested that the expected path for the federal funds rate was little changed over the intermeeting period and that the ex- pected policy rate would remain below 25 basis points until the first quarter of 2023. Market-based financing conditions remained accommodative, and bank lending conditions eased markedly. Despite recent improve- ments, lending standards for commercial and industrial (C&I) and consumer loans remained tighter than pre- pandemic levels. Broad stock price indexes increased over the intermeet- ing period, with outperformance by technology stocks and stocks sensitive to consumer discretionary spending. One-month option-implied volatility on the S&P 500— the VIX—declined, approaching the median level ob- served in the decade before the pandemic. Spreads of yields on investment- and speculative-grade corporate bonds over comparable-maturity Treasury yields nar- rowed moderately. Spreads on municipal bonds were little changed, with yields on such bonds remaining close to their lowest levels in more than 20 years. Domestic short-term funding markets remained stable. Funding rates stayed very low against the backdrop of continued paydowns in Treasury bills and substantial in- creases in reserve balances stemming from Federal Re- serve asset purchases as well as the drawdown in bal- ances maintained in the Treasury General Account asso- ciated with stimulus payments and other fiscal outlays. Assets under management increased somewhat for gov- ernment money market funds (MMFs) but declined slightly for prime MMFs. The weighted average ma- turity of government and prime MMFs remained ele- vated. The effective federal funds rate and the SOFR were little changed, averaging 7 basis points and 1 basis point, re- spectively, over the intermeeting period. There contin- ued to be no participation in the Fed’s repo operations. Participation in the Fed’s reverse repo facility increased from minimal levels to an average of $47 billion and reached $134 billion on the quarter-end date. Factors that had stressed foreign financial markets ear- lier this year—rising U.S. interest rates, resurging COVID-19 cases, and renewed lockdowns in a number of countries—appeared less concerning to global inves- tors over the intermeeting period. Most AFE equity in- dexes rose modestly, and most AFE sovereign bond yields were little changed. In emerging market econo- mies (EMEs), market optimism was tempered in part by rising COVID-19 cases. The broad EME equity price Page 6 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ index was little changed, while credit spreads widened somewhat in the most vulnerable EMEs. After robust inflows earlier this year, flows into EME-dedicated funds continued at a moderate pace. The broad dollar index fell modestly. Financing conditions for nonfinancial businesses in cap- ital markets remained highly accommodative over the in- termeeting period, as reflected in low corporate bond yields and high price-to-earnings ratios in equity mar- kets. Gross corporate bond issuance and gross lever- aged loan issuance were robust in February and March. Equity raised through traditional initial public offerings (IPOs) and seasoned equity offerings, as well as through special purpose acquisition companies, continued to be substantial in March. C&I loans outstanding at banks expanded in February and March after contracting for more than half a year. In the April Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices (SLOOS), banks reported easing standards, on net, for C&I loans across firms of all sizes over the first quarter. Banks also reported that demand for C&I loans weakened at large and middle-market firms and was basically unchanged at small firms. The credit quality of nonfinancial corporations showed further signs of improvement for lower-rated firms. Following a modest uptick in February, the volume of nonfinancial corporate bond downgrades spiked in March, but the spike reflected the downgrades of a few large and highly rated investment-grade firms. In con- trast, for speculative-grade issuers, the volume of up- grades modestly exceeded that of downgrades in Febru- ary and March. Nonfinancial corporate bond defaults remained at low levels in February and March. Market indicators of future default expectations were little changed and stayed low. Financing conditions in the municipal bond market re- mained accommodative over the intermeeting period. Issuance of municipal bonds was strong in March, and indicators of the credit quality of municipal debt were little changed in February and March. Financing condi- tions for small businesses appeared to have improved, with demand for loans remaining subdued. Likely in part because of the Paycheck Protection Program, small business loan originations rose notably in February, the most recent month for which data were available, and were close to pre-pandemic levels. However, even amid improving financing conditions, many small businesses remained under financial stress. For commercial real estate (CRE) financed through cap- ital markets, financing conditions remained accommo- dative over the intermeeting period. Although overall delinquency rates in agency commercial mortgage- backed securities (CMBS) declined in the past few months, delinquency rates on hotel and retail mortgages in CMBS pools remained high. CRE loans held by banks were little changed in March. In the April SLOOS, changes in lending standards over the first quarter were mixed across CRE loan categories. Financing conditions in the residential mortgage market were little changed over the intermeeting period and re- mained accommodative for stronger borrowers who met standard conforming loan criteria. Credit remained tight for borrowers with lower credit scores. Mortgage rates for most borrowers were little changed on net. In the April SLOOS, banks reported easing standards on most types of mortgages. The share of mortgages in forbear- ance declined slightly in March. Financing conditions in consumer credit markets gener- ally remained accommodative for borrowers with strong credit scores but tight for those with subprime scores. Consumer loans grew at a robust pace in February, re- flecting the continued expansion of auto loans and a par- tial rebound in credit card account balances. Banks in the April SLOOS reported easing auto lending standards in the first quarter but generally reported that standards remained tight compared with the end of 2019, espe- cially for nonprime borrowers. Banks also reported that standards on credit cards eased over the first quarter of 2021 but were generally still tighter than before the pan- demic. Interest rates offered to nonprime borrowers continued to rise through February, with the fraction of these offers with zero introductory rates continuing to decline. The staff provided an update on its assessments of the stability of the financial system. The staff noted that cor- porate bond spreads had declined notably since late last year and were at the lower ends of their historical distri- butions. In addition, measures of the equity risk pre- mium declined further, and nonprice measures, such as high IPO volume, also indicated elevated investor appe- tite for risk in the equity market. Valuation pressures for CRE remained high, although information related to CRE continued to be noisier than usual due to pan- demic-induced declines in transactions. House price growth increased further, with house prices outpacing rents. In contrast, vulnerabilities from both household and business debt had diminished, reflecting continued _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Minutes of the Meeting of April 27–28, 2021 Page 7 government support, a slower pace of business borrow- ing, and improving business earnings, although many households and businesses continued to struggle. Re- garding financial leverage, the staff noted that bank cap- ital ratios remained above pre-pandemic levels in the fourth quarter, but risks remained. Leverage among hedge funds was elevated and increased in the third quarter of last year for the most highly leveraged funds. Leverage in hedge funds’ prime brokerage accounts rose notably through the fourth quarter of last year, reflecting elevated hedge fund leverage related to their stock mar- ket activities. The staff highlighted recent episodes un- derlining the opacity of risk exposures among some lev- eraged entities. With regard to funding risks, the staff noted that MMFs and open-end mutual funds faced sig- nificant structural vulnerabilities associated with liquidity transformation. Assets under management at MMFs de- clined during the second half of 2020, while open-end mutual fund holdings of corporate bonds rose during the second half of last year. Staff Economic Outlook The U.S. economic projection prepared by the staff for the April FOMC meeting was slightly stronger than the March forecast. Real GDP growth was projected to post a substantial increase this year, with a correspondingly rapid decline in the unemployment rate, as further re- ductions in social distancing and favorable financial con- ditions were expected to support output growth. With the boost to growth from continued reductions in social distancing assumed to fade after 2021, GDP growth was expected to step down in 2022 and 2023. However, with monetary policy assumed to remain highly accommoda- tive, the staff continued to anticipate that real GDP growth would outpace that of potential over much of this period, leading to a decline in the unemployment rate to historically low levels. The staff’s outlook for inflation was broadly unchanged. The 12-month changes in total and core PCE prices were expected to move above 2 percent in coming months as the unusually low readings from the spring of 2020 dropped out of the calculation window and as a recent jump in consumer energy prices pushed up the total measure. Core inflation was expected to ease some later in the year but to remain above 2 percent at the end of 2021, boosted by large increases in import prices, a recovery in prices that had been especially affected by the pandemic, and the temporary effects of supply bot- tlenecks. Inflation was then projected to dip slightly be- low 2 percent in 2022 as the influence of these transitory factors diminished, before returning to 2 percent by the end of 2023, supported by sustained tight levels of re- source utilization in labor and product markets. The staff continued to judge that the risks to the baseline projection for economic activity were skewed to the downside and that the uncertainty around the forecast was elevated. In particular, despite the demonstrated re- silience of the economy to surges in the pandemic over the past year, the possibility that COVID-19 variants that were more contagious or more resistant to existing vaccines would spread posed a salient downside risk. The staff continued to view the risks around the inflation projection as balanced. On the upside, bottlenecks, sup- ply disruptions, and historically high rates of resource utilization were seen as potential sources of greater-than- expected inflationary pressures. Alternatively, the possi- bility that inflation would be held down by low underly- ing trend inflation and a weaker-than-expected response to resource utilization was seen as an important down- side risk. Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook In their discussion of current conditions, participants noted that the COVID-19 pandemic was causing tre- mendous human and economic hardship across the United States and around the world. Amid progress on vaccinations and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment had strengthened. The sectors most adversely affected by the pandemic re- mained weak but had shown improvement. Inflation had risen, largely reflecting transitory factors. Overall financial conditions remained accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses. Participants noted that the path of the economy would depend significantly on the course of the virus, including progress on vaccinations. The ongoing public health cri- sis continued to weigh on the economy, and risks to the economic outlook remained. Participants observed that economic activity had picked up sharply this year, with robust gains in consumer spending, housing-sector activity, business equipment investment, and manufacturing production. They noted that the acceleration in economic activity reflected posi- tive developments associated with the rapid pace of vac- cinations as well as continued support from fiscal and monetary policies. Nevertheless, participants generally noted that the economy remained far from the Commit- tee’s maximum-employment and price-stability goals. In their discussion of the household sector, participants remarked that indicators of consumer spending surged Page 8 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ in March and expected that further gains in spending would contribute significantly to the economic recovery. Many participants commented that fiscal stimulus, ac- commodative financial conditions, the release of pent- up demand, progress on widespread vaccination, and the ongoing reduction of social-distancing measures were important factors supporting spending. Many partici- pants also noted that consumer spending would con- tinue to be bolstered by these factors as well as by the elevated level of accumulated household savings. Sev- eral participants observed that housing market activity continued to be strong, supported in part by low interest rates. With respect to the business sector, participants noted that business equipment investment continued to rise at a robust pace and manufacturing activity was expanding at a strong clip. That said, many participants discussed reports of shortages of materials and labor as well as sup- ply chain bottlenecks as likely restraints to the pace of recovery in manufacturing and other business sectors. Many participants also noted that their District contacts had reported a pickup in activity in the leisure, travel, and hospitality sectors. Those contacts had grown increas- ingly optimistic about overall business conditions, given ongoing progress on vaccinations, easing of restrictions on in-person activities, and substantial fiscal support. A couple of participants reported improved conditions in the agricultural sector, with farmers’ income supported by higher crop prices and federal aid payments. Participants commented on the continued improvement in labor market conditions in recent months. Job gains in the March employment report were strong, and the unemployment rate fell to 6.0 percent. Even so, partic- ipants judged that the economy was far from achieving the Committee’s broad-based and inclusive maximum- employment goal. Payroll employment was 8.4 million jobs below its pre-pandemic level. Some participants noted that the labor market recovery continued to be un- even across demographic and income groups and across sectors. Many participants also remarked that business contacts in their Districts reported having trouble hiring workers, likely reflecting factors such as early retire- ments, health concerns, childcare responsibilities, and expanded unemployment insurance benefits. Many par- ticipants noted as well that these factors were depressing the labor force participation rate, relative to its pre-pan- demic level. Some of these factors were seen as likely to remain significant while pandemic-related risks per- sisted. Based on reports from business contacts, some participants noted that the step-up in demand for labor had started to put some upward pressure on wages. Moreover, over the medium term, participants expected labor market conditions to continue to improve, sup- ported by accommodative fiscal and monetary policies as well as continued progress on vaccinations, unwind- ing of social distancing, and the associated recovery in economic activity. A couple of participants remarked that businesses in industries severely affected by the pan- demic were downsizing or that some businesses were fo- cused on cutting costs or increasing productivity, partic- ularly through automation. In their comments about inflation, participants antici- pated that inflation as measured by the 12-month change of the PCE price index would move above 2 percent in the near term as very low readings from early in the pan- demic fall out of the calculation. In addition, increases in oil prices were expected to pass through to consumer energy prices. Participants also noted that the expected surge in demand as the economy reopens further, along with some transitory supply chain bottlenecks, would contribute to PCE price inflation temporarily running somewhat above 2 percent. After the transitory effects of these factors fade, participants generally expected measured inflation to ease. Looking further ahead, par- ticipants expected inflation to be at levels consistent with achieving the Committee’s objectives over time. A num- ber of participants remarked that supply chain bottle- necks and input shortages may not be resolved quickly and, if so, these factors could put upward pressure on prices beyond this year. They noted that in some indus- tries, supply chain disruptions appeared to be more per- sistent than originally anticipated and reportedly had led to higher input costs. Despite the expected short-run fluctuations in measured inflation, many participants commented that various measures of longer-term infla- tion expectations remained well anchored at levels broadly consistent with achieving the Committee’s longer-run goals. Participants judged that uncertainty was elevated and that the outlook was highly dependent on the course of the virus. Amid considerable progress on vaccinations, the unwinding of social distancing, and strong policy support, participants assessed that risks to the outlook were no longer as elevated as in previous months. Nev- ertheless, some participants remarked that the pandemic continued to pose downside risks to the economic out- look and noted the potential for an uneven recovery in light of new virus strains and potential hesitancy regard- ing vaccination. As upside risks, some participants men- tioned that the release of pent-up demand, accumulated excess household savings, and rapid progress on vac- cinations, amid continued fiscal and monetary support, _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Minutes of the Meeting of April 27–28, 2021 Page 9 could boost economic activity and bring individuals back into the labor force more quickly than currently ex- pected. Some participants mentioned upside risks around the inflation outlook that could arise if tempo- rary factors influencing inflation turned out to be more persistent than expected. Participants who commented on financial stability agreed that the financial sector had shown resilience dur- ing the pandemic, in large part reflecting strong policy support. Some remarked that the capital positions and loan loss reserves at large banks remained high, and earnings were strong. A few participants noted that vul- nerabilities from both business and household debt were at a moderate level. Nevertheless, a couple of partici- pants highlighted that forbearance programs instituted in response to the pandemic could be masking vulnera- bilities among households and businesses. Regarding as- set valuations, several participants noted that risk appe- tite in capital markets was elevated, as equity valuations had risen further, IPO activity remained high, and risk spreads on corporate bonds were at the bottom of their historical distribution. A couple of participants re- marked that, should investor risk appetite fall, an associ- ated drop in asset prices coupled with high business and financial leverage could have adverse implications for the real economy. A number of participants commented on valuation pressures being somewhat elevated in the housing market. Some participants mentioned the po- tential risks to the financial system stemming from the activities of hedge funds and other leveraged investors, commenting on the limited visibility into the activities of these entities or on the prudential risk-management practices of dealers’ prime-brokerage businesses. Some participants highlighted potential vulnerabilities in other parts of the financial system, including run-prone invest- ment funds in short-term funding and credit markets. Various participants commented on the prolonged pe- riod of low interest rates and highly accommodative fi- nancial market conditions and the possibility for these conditions to lead to reach-for-yield behavior that could raise financial stability risks. In their consideration of the stance of monetary policy, participants reaffirmed the Federal Reserve’s commit- ment to using its full range of tools to support the U.S. economy during this challenging time, thereby promot- ing the Committee’s statutory goals of maximum em- ployment and price stability. Participants agreed that the economy was still far from the Committee’s longer-run goals. Moreover, the path ahead continued to depend on the course of the virus, and risks to the economic outlook remained. Consequently, participants judged that the current stance of policy and policy guidance re- mained appropriate to foster further economic recovery as well as to achieve inflation that averages 2 percent over time and longer-term inflation expectations that continue to be well anchored at 2 percent. Participants judged that the Committee’s current guid- ance for the federal funds rate and asset purchases was serving the economy well. Participants also noted that the existing outcome-based guidance implied that the path of the federal funds rate and the balance sheet would depend on actual progress toward reaching the Committee’s maximum-employment and inflation goals. In particular, some participants emphasized that an im- portant feature of the outcome-based guidance was that policy would be set based on observed progress toward the Committee’s goals, not on uncertain economic fore- casts. However, a couple of participants commented on the risks of inflation pressures building up to unwelcome levels before they become sufficiently evident to induce a policy reaction. In their discussion of the Federal Reserve’s asset pur- chases, various participants noted that it would likely be some time until the economy had made substantial fur- ther progress toward the Committee’s maximum-em- ployment and price-stability goals relative to the condi- tions prevailing in December 2020 when the Committee first provided its guidance for asset purchases. Con- sistent with the Committee’s outcome-based guidance, purchases would continue at least at the current pace un- til that time. Many participants highlighted the im- portance of the Committee clearly communicating its as- sessment of progress toward its longer-run goals well in advance of the time when it could be judged substantial enough to warrant a change in the pace of asset pur- chases. The timing of such communications would de- pend on the evolution of the economy and the pace of progress toward the Committee’s goals. A number of participants suggested that if the economy continued to make rapid progress toward the Committee’s goals, it might be appropriate at some point in upcoming meet- ings to begin discussing a plan for adjusting the pace of asset purchases. Committee Policy Action In their discussion of monetary policy for this meeting, members agreed that the COVID-19 pandemic was causing tremendous human and economic hardship across the United States and around the world. They noted that amid progress on vaccinations and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and em- ployment had strengthened. Although the sectors most Page 10 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ adversely affected by the pandemic remained weak, they had shown improvement. Inflation had risen, largely re- flecting transitory factors. Overall financial conditions remained accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses. Members also re- marked that the path of the economy would depend sig- nificantly on the course of the virus, including progress on vaccinations. In addition, members agreed that the ongoing public health crisis continued to weigh on the economy and risks to the economic outlook remained. Members agreed that the Federal Reserve was commit- ted to using its full range of tools to support the U.S. economy in this challenging time, thereby promoting its maximum-employment and price-stability goals. All members reaffirmed that, in accordance with the Com- mittee’s goals to achieve maximum employment and in- flation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run and with inflation running persistently below this longer-run goal, they would aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and longer-term inflation expecta- tions remain well anchored at 2 percent. Members ex- pected to maintain an accommodative stance of mone- tary policy until those outcomes were achieved. All members agreed to keep the target range for the fed- eral funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent, and they expected that it would be appropriate to maintain this target range un- til labor market conditions had reached levels consistent with the Committee’s assessments of maximum employ- ment and inflation had risen to 2 percent and was on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time. In addition, members agreed that it would be appropriate for the Federal Reserve to continue to increase its hold- ings of Treasury securities by at least $80 billion per month and agency mortgage-backed securities by at least $40 billion per month until substantial further progress had been made toward the Committee’s maximum-em- ployment and price-stability goals. They judged that these asset purchases would help foster smooth market functioning and accommodative financial conditions, thereby supporting the flow of credit to households and businesses. Members agreed that, in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, they would continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and that they would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate in the event that risks emerged that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals. Members also concurred that, in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, they would take into account a wide range of information, in- cluding readings on public health, labor market condi- tions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments. Members agreed that the postmeeting statement should acknowledge that indicators of economic activity and employment had strengthened but that, despite showing improvement, the sectors of the economy most affected by the pandemic remained weak. Members also judged that, while risks to the outlook remained, continued pro- gress on vaccinations and accommodative monetary and fiscal policies most likely would underpin further gains in economic activity and employment and would limit risks to the outlook. As a result, they agreed to remove the characterization of risks as “considerable” in the FOMC statement. With regard to the characterization of inflation, members agreed that the statement should note that inflation had risen but that the increase largely reflected transitory factors. They noted that inflation as measured by the 12-month change of the PCE price in- dex was expected to move above 2 percent as the very low readings from early in the pandemic fell out of the calculation and as past increases in oil prices passed through to consumer energy prices. The expected re- bound in spending as the economy continued to reopen was also likely to boost inflation temporarily, particularly if supply bottlenecks limited how quickly production could respond to demand in the near term. However, members also viewed these increases in prices as likely to have only transitory effects on inflation. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the fol- lowing domestic policy directive, for release at 2:00 p.m.: “Effective April 29, 2021, the Federal Open Market Committee directs the Desk to:  Undertake open market operations as nec- essary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of 0 to ¼ percent.  Increase the System Open Market Ac- count holdings of Treasury securities by $80 billion per month and of agency mort- gage-backed securities (MBS) by $40 bil- lion per month.  Increase holdings of Treasury securities and agency MBS by additional amounts _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Minutes of the Meeting of April 27–28, 2021 Page 11 and purchase agency commercial mort- gage-backed securities (CMBS) as needed to sustain smooth functioning of markets for these securities.  Conduct repurchase agreement operations to support effective policy implementation and the smooth functioning of short-term U.S. dollar funding markets.  Conduct overnight reverse repurchase agreement operations at an offering rate of 0.00 percent and with a per-counterparty limit of $80 billion per day; the per-coun- terparty limit can be temporarily increased at the discretion of the Chair.  Roll over at auction all principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of Treasury securities and reinvest all princi- pal payments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of agency debt and agency MBS in agency MBS.  Allow modest deviations from stated amounts for purchases and reinvestments, if needed for operational reasons.  Engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settle- ment of the Federal Reserve’s agency MBS transactions.” The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below for release at 2:00 p.m.: “The Federal Reserve is committed to using its full range of tools to support the U.S. economy in this challenging time, thereby promoting its maximum employment and price stability goals. The COVID-19 pandemic is causing tremen- dous human and economic hardship across the United States and around the world. Amid pro- gress on vaccinations and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employ- ment have strengthened. The sectors most ad- versely affected by the pandemic remain weak but have shown improvement. Inflation has risen, largely reflecting transitory factors. Over- all financial conditions remain accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. house- holds and businesses. The path of the economy will depend signifi- cantly on the course of the virus, including pro- gress on vaccinations. The ongoing public health crisis continues to weigh on the econ- omy, and risks to the economic outlook remain. The Committee seeks to achieve maximum em- ployment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. With inflation running per- sistently below this longer-run goal, the Com- mittee will aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and longer‑term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent. The Committee expects to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these outcomes are achieved. The Com- mittee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and expects it will be appropriate to maintain this target range until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee’s assessments of maximum employment and in- flation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time. In addition, the Federal Reserve will continue to increase its holdings of Treasury securities by at least $80 billion per month and of agency mort- gage‑backed securities by at least $40 billion per month until substantial further progress has been made toward the Committee’s maximum employment and price stability goals. These as- set purchases help foster smooth market func- tioning and accommodative financial condi- tions, thereby supporting the flow of credit to households and businesses. In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals. The Committee’s assessments will take into account a wide range of information, in- cluding readings on public health, labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation ex- pectations, and financial and international de- velopments.” Voting for this action: Jerome H.

Building on discussion at previous meetings, the staff presented considerations for how these facilities might be designed. The design considerations were guided by Page 2 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ participants’ general desire to have these facilities play a backstop role in fostering effective implementation of monetary policy and supporting smooth functioning of markets. In April, participants highlighted the im- portance of designing these facilities in a way that would leave ample room for private market activity while min- imizing the potential for stigma, promote equitable ac- cess to an appropriately broad set of counterparties, and be governed by the FOMC. With these principles and goals in mind, the staff presented potential terms for each facility. The staff presentation on the potential design of a do- mestic SRF included establishing the minimum bid rate at 25 basis points—the top of the target range for the federal funds rate. The staff briefing suggested counter- parties for the facility would include primary dealers and would be extended over time to include banks that ex- pressed interest in participation. The staff presentation noted that such a facility could be limited to only U.S. Treasury securities or could accept all securities currently accepted in open market operations (OMOs), which in- clude Treasury securities, agency securities, and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS). The briefing noted that, on the one hand, restricting eligible collateral for a domestic SRF to U.S. Treasury securities could mitigate concerns that an SRF could encourage counterparties to take on greater liquidity risk. On the other hand, accept- ing agency securities and agency MBS in an SRF would be consistent with the structure of current repo opera- tions and could help address a greater range of potential repo market pressures from spilling over into the federal funds market. The proposed design for a standing FIMA repo facility was similar in structure to the existing temporary FIMA repo facility. Under the draft terms, the range of eligible counterparties for the FIMA repo facility would con- tinue to include foreign official institutions, largely com- prising central banks, subject to individual approval. The eligible collateral would continue to be limited to U.S. Treasury securities. The draft terms envisioned that the rate for the FIMA repo facility would be set equal to the top of the target range for the federal funds rate, a rate equal to the minimum bid rate in the draft terms for the domestic SRF. In their discussion of considerations related to the de- sign of a domestic SRF, a substantial majority restated their view, conveyed at the April 2021 meeting, that the potential benefits of such a facility outweighed the po- tential costs. Participants broadly supported the terms presented by the staff for such a facility. Several partic- ipants noted the importance of setting the minimum bid rate high enough so that the facility was positioned as a backstop, while some pointed out the importance of not setting the rate so high that usage of the facility could be stigmatized or that the facility would not sufficiently contain pressures that could spill over into the federal funds market. Several participants noted that setting an SRF rate at the top of the target range for the federal funds rate would be consistent with addressing pressures that could spill over to the federal funds market. Others remarked that setting the SRF rate at the same level as the primary credit rate for borrowing at the discount window would promote equitable access to Federal Re- serve liquidity across banks and counterparties for OMOs. Several participants commented that it may also be appropriate to adjust the SRF rate over time based on accumulated experience and economic or financial de- velopments. Several participants suggested that, in order to ensure an SRF continues to be effective, it may be appropriate to study the costs and benefits of additional adjustments over time, such as moving to a cleared set- tlement structure. Most participants noted the benefits of allowing banks to be counterparties to a domestic SRF, including more directly addressing liquidity pres- sures for participants in the federal funds market and promoting equitable access to liquidity across domestic counterparties. Many participants judged that it would be appropriate to accept the same set of securities that is currently accepted for OMOs. Some participants indi- cated that accepting these securities in the domestic SRF’s operations should increase the effectiveness of the facility in limiting upward pressures in repo markets that could spill over into the federal funds market. Some other participants noted that limiting acceptable securi- ties for SRF operations to U.S. Treasury securities could have benefits, including consistency with the regulatory distinction between U.S. Treasury securities and other types of securities, potentially limiting the Federal Re- serve’s footprint in financial markets, and maintaining consistency with the structure of the proposed FIMA repo facility and the overnight reverse repo (ON RRP) facility. Several participants cautioned that establishing a backstop SRF would not diminish the importance of providing a sufficiently ample supply of reserves on an ongoing basis or the need to improve the structural re- siliency of the U.S. Treasury market. A couple of partic- ipants reiterated their concerns about converting current ongoing daily repo operations to a standing facility and suggested ways to calibrate the terms of the facility to mitigate these concerns, including setting a relatively Minutes of the Meeting of June 15–16, 2021 Page 3 _____________________________________________________________________________________________ high minimum bid rate or limiting securities eligible for SRF operations to only U.S. Treasury securities. In their discussion of considerations related to the de- sign of a standing FIMA repo facility, a substantial ma- jority supported the broad structure discussed in the staff presentation. Many participants generally saw ben- efits in keeping the rate at the same level as that in the potential domestic SRF in light of the similar nature of the transactions and high quality of the collateral. A number of participants remarked that the rate at the FIMA repo facility could be set at a higher level than at the domestic SRF or could be set at a level comparable to that in the Federal Reserve’s dollar liquidity swap lines. A couple of participants commented on the po- tential reputational risks of establishing a standing FIMA repo facility, including those associated with providing liquidity on a standing basis to a wider set of central banks and finance ministries than through existing swap lines. These participants reiterated the importance of maintaining well-defined criteria for participation in the facility and suggested that the FOMC should receive reg- ular reports on the operations and counterparties ap- proved for a standing FIMA repo facility. Participants agreed that they would continue their dis- cussion of design parameters for both a domestic SRF and a standing FIMA repo facility. The Chair asked the staff to work on a specific proposal that reflected the views expressed by participants at this meeting. Developments in Financial Markets and Open Market Operations The manager turned first to a discussion of financial market developments over the intermeeting period. On net, U.S. financial conditions eased further, led by a de- cline in Treasury yields. Lower term premiums appeared to be a significant component of the declines, as re- flected by lower implied volatility on longer-term inter- est rates. Equities rose slightly, the broad dollar weak- ened, and credit spreads were little changed at histori- cally tight levels. Over the period, market participants focused on data showing lower employment growth and higher inflation readings than had been expected. The median 2021 core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation forecast from the Open Market Desk’s Survey of Pri- mary Dealers jumped nearly 1 percentage point from the previous survey. However, median forecasts for 2022 and 2023 each rose less than 0.1 percent, suggesting ex- pectations for inflationary pressures to subside. Infla- tion compensation as measured by five-year breakeven rates on Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities peaked in mid-May at the highest level in more than a decade, but the increase was driven almost entirely by higher in- flation compensation at short horizons. Indeed, one- year-forward inflation compensation at horizons beyond a year was relatively stable. Measures of expectations for Federal Reserve policy were little changed over the period. The median re- spondent to the Desk’s surveys of primary dealers and market participants continued to expect the pace of Fed- eral Reserve asset purchases to begin to decline in the first quarter of 2022, although most respondents also saw a reasonable chance that this decline could occur one quarter earlier or later. The median respondent ex- pected purchases to end in the fourth quarter of 2022. The Desk’s survey measures of the expected path of the target federal funds rate were also fairly steady, and the median respondent continued to expect the first target rate increase to occur in the third quarter of 2023. Nearly all Desk survey respondents anticipated that the Summary of Economic Projections would show the me- dian Committee participant projecting either no increase in the target range or one ¼ percentage point increase by the end of 2023. The manager noted that downward pressure on money market rates continued over the period. Banks contin- ued to limit growth in their balance sheets by allowing wholesale liabilities to mature and encouraging custom- ers to shift some nonoperational deposits to money mar- ket funds. Moreover, the supply of Treasury bills, a pri- mary investment for government money market mutual funds, fell further. Against this backdrop, the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) printed at 1 basis point each day in the intermeeting period, while the ef- fective federal funds rate (EFFR) decreased 1 basis point, to 6 basis points. Amid heightened demand and reduced supply for short- term investments, the ON RRP continued to maintain a floor on overnight rates. Growth in the ON RRP and other nonreserve liabilities helped expand the base of Federal Reserve liabilities supporting asset purchases, damping the increase in reserves and easing pressure on bank balance sheets. Over the next intermeeting period, the manager antici- pated that further increases in reserves and reductions in bill supply could put additional downward pressure on overnight rates. A modest technical adjustment to ad- ministered rates could be warranted to maintain the EFFR well within the target range and support smooth functioning of short-term funding markets. Such an ad- justment would be expected to raise the federal funds Page 4 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ rate and to lift other overnight rates modestly. Most re- spondents to the Desk’s surveys expected an adminis- tered rate adjustment this summer. The manager noted that balances at the ON RRP facility would likely con- tinue to grow over coming months. The staff would continue to monitor developments, and the manager noted that, at some point, it could become appropriate to consider raising the counterparty limits for the ON RRP. The manager provided an update on progress toward winding down a number of emergency facilities estab- lished under section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act. While market participants took note of the Federal Re- serve Board’s announcement on winding down the Sec- ondary Market Corporate Credit Facility (SMCCF) hold- ings, it elicited little price response. The commencement of exchange-traded funds sales proceeded smoothly. All of the SMCCF assets are expected to be sold by the end of this year. Finally, the manager noted a proposal to request the Chair’s approval for an extension to the temporary U.S. dollar liquidity swap arrangements to December 31, 2021. The extension would benefit the U.S. economy by helping forestall potential pressures in offshore dollar funding markets that could spill over to U.S. financial conditions while much of the global economy remains on an uncertain recovery path from the pandemic. Should the Committee decide to make the FIMA repo facility standing, an extension would also provide suffi- cient time for those temporary swap line central banks that are not currently enrolled in the FIMA repo facility to do so and to become fully operational. Secretary’s note: The Chair subsequently pro- vided approval to the Desk, following the pro- cedures in the Authorization for Foreign Cur- rency Operations, to extend the expiration of the temporary U.S. dollar liquidity swap lines through December 31, 2021. By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk’s domestic transactions over the intermeeting period. There were no intervention operations in foreign curren- cies for the System’s account during the intermeeting pe- riod. Staff Review of the Economic Situation The information available at the time of the June 15–16 meeting suggested that U.S. real gross domestic product (GDP) was expanding in the second quarter at a pace that was faster than in the first quarter of the year. More- over, labor market conditions had improved further in April and May. Consumer price inflation through April—as measured by the 12-month percentage change in the PCE price index—had picked up notably, largely reflecting transitory factors. Total nonfarm payroll employment increased solidly over April and May, though at a slower monthly pace than over February and March. As of May, total payroll employment had retraced two-thirds of the job losses seen at the onset of the pandemic, although employment in the leisure and hospitality sector and in the education sector (including both public and private education) had bounced back by less. Over April and May, the unem- ployment rate edged down and stood at 5.8 percent in May. The unemployment rates for African Americans, Asians, and Hispanics also moved down, although the rates for African Americans and Hispanics remained well above the national average. Both the labor force participation rate and the employment-to-population ra- tio moved up slightly, and both measures had recovered only partially from their lows during the pandemic. Ini- tial claims for regular state unemployment insurance benefits had moved down further since mid-April and were at the lowest level since the beginning of the pan- demic, though they remained high relative to their pre- pandemic level. Weekly estimates of private-sector pay- rolls constructed by Federal Reserve Board staff using data provided by the payroll processor ADP, which were available through May, suggested that the pace of private employment gains had stepped up late in that month. The pace of increases in several measures of labor com- pensation had moved up in recent months. Average hourly earnings for all employees jumped at a sizable monthly rate in April and May, even though the large job gains in the leisure and hospitality sector—where wages tend to be lower than in other sectors—likely held down the increases in average hourly earnings in these months. A staff measure of the 12-month change in the median wage derived from the ADP data had stepped up signif- icantly in April relative to March. The employment cost index of total hourly compensation in the private sector increased at an annual rate of 4 percent in the three months ending in March, a notably faster pace than over the previous three months. Recent 12-month change measures of inflation, using ei- ther PCE prices or the consumer price index (CPI), were boosted significantly by the base effects of the drop in prices from the spring of 2020 rolling out of the calcula- tion. In addition, a surge in demand as the economy re- opened further, combined with production bottlenecks and supply constraints, contributed to the large recent Minutes of the Meeting of June 15–16, 2021 Page 5 _____________________________________________________________________________________________ monthly price increases. Total PCE price inflation was 3.6 percent over the 12 months ending in April. Core PCE price inflation, which excludes changes in con- sumer energy prices and many consumer food prices, was 3.1 percent over the 12 months ending in April. In contrast, the trimmed mean measure of 12-month PCE inflation constructed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas was 1.8 percent in April. In May, the 12-month change in the CPI was 5 percent, while core CPI infla- tion was 3.8 percent over the same period. In the second quarter, the staff’s common inflation expectations index, which combines information from many indicators of inflation expectations and inflation compensation, had returned to the level that prevailed in 2014, a time when inflation was modest. Real PCE increased substantially in March and then was little changed from that high level in April. The compo- nents of the nominal retail sales data that are used to es- timate PCE edged down in May, but the sales data for the previous two months were revised up markedly, pointing to stronger real PCE growth than had been in- itially estimated. Combined with reduced social distanc- ing and more widespread vaccinations, key factors that influence consumer spending—including increasing job gains, the upward trend in real disposable income, high levels of household net worth, and low interest rates— pointed to strong real PCE growth over the rest of the year. Housing demand continued to be robust, with construc- tion of single-family homes and home sales remaining well above their pre-pandemic levels and house prices rising appreciably further. The incoming data for this sector indicated that residential investment spending was being temporarily held back in the second quarter by ma- terials shortages and limited stocks of homes for sale. Available indicators suggested that equipment and intan- gibles investment—particularly in high-tech catego- ries—was increasing solidly in the second quarter. Ris- ing orders for nondefense capital goods excluding air- craft were running well above the increases in shipments of those goods through April, which pointed to addi- tional gains in business equipment spending in coming months. Moreover, business investment in the drilling and mining sector appeared to be increasing further, as crude oil and natural gas rigs in operation—an indicator of drilling investment—continued to rise through early June, with oil prices moving higher. However, nominal nonresidential construction spending declined further in April, and investment in nonresidential structures out- side of the drilling and mining sector looked to remain weak in the current quarter, likely reflecting continued hesitation by businesses to commit to building projects with lengthy times to completion and uncertain future returns. Manufacturing output expanded solidly, on balance, over April and May. Output in the motor vehicle and parts sector rose, on net, although semiconductor short- ages were still weighing on vehicle production. Factory output outside of the motor vehicle sector increased sol- idly, and production in the mining sector, which includes crude oil and natural gas extraction, also increased over April and May. Total real government purchases looked to be about flat, on balance, in the second quarter. Data through May indicated that real federal defense spending was rising only slightly, and nondefense spending was expected to drop following a first-quarter surge in pandemic-related expenditures. State and local government purchases looked to be increasing significantly, as the payrolls of these governments expanded solidly over April and May. Nominal state and local construction spending, how- ever, edged down in April. With the strong economic recovery leading to an improved outlook for state and local tax revenues, and the additional federal support for these governments included in the American Rescue Plan, state and local purchases appeared likely to in- crease notably over the rest of the year. The nominal U.S. international trade deficit widened to a record size in March and then reversed that widening in April. Real goods exports in March surpassed their January 2020 levels for the first time and then continued to grow in April, with particular strength in exports of capital goods. Real goods imports surged to record-high levels in March and then stepped back modestly in April. Bottlenecks in the global semiconductor industry, which had weighed on exports and imports of automotive products this year, continued to do so through April. Exports and imports of services remained depressed rel- ative to pre-pandemic levels, as international travel in- creased only slightly from February. Recent data pointed to a pickup in foreign economic ac- tivity in the second quarter. Demand improved as social-distancing restrictions were lifted in the United Kingdom and the euro area following the rollout of vac- cines. With the economic reopening under way, pur- chasing managers indexes (PMIs) in both the manufac- turing and services sectors were strong in Europe in April and May. In the emerging market economies (EMEs), manufacturing PMIs and exports were gener- Page 6 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ ally robust. However, many EMEs continued to strug- gle to contain the virus amid a slow pace of vaccinations, particularly in South America and parts of Asia. Con- sumer price inflation continued to rise in many foreign economies, primarily driven by rebounding energy prices and the fading effects of steep price declines seen early last year. Price increases were concentrated in rel- atively few items, suggesting that underlying inflationary pressures remained subdued amid considerable eco- nomic slack. Staff Review of the Financial Situation Overall financial conditions eased during the intermeet- ing period as market participants appeared to remain confident that the economic recovery was broadly on track, that inflation over the medium term would stay contained, and that monetary policy would remain ac- commodative. Domestic equity prices edged up, and corporate bond spreads narrowed a little. Yields on nominal Treasury securities declined modestly since the previous FOMC meeting. Measures of inflation com- pensation at shorter horizons moved down somewhat, on net, while measures of longer-term inflation compen- sation were little changed. A straight read of overnight index swap (OIS) quotes suggested that the expected path for the federal funds rate moved lower over the in- termeeting period and that the expected policy rate would remain below 25 basis points until the first quarter of 2023. Short-term funding markets functioned smoothly amid record participation in the ON RRP fa- cility. Financing conditions for businesses and house- holds remained accommodative, particularly for large firms and households with high credit ratings. The Treasury yield curve flattened a bit, on net, with 2-year yields about unchanged while 5-, 10-, and 30-year yields declined somewhat. Inflation compensation de- clined a bit at shorter horizons but held steady at longer horizons. Market expectations for the federal funds rate path over the medium term, as implied by OIS quotes unadjusted for term premiums, declined moderately. Broad stock price indexes increased slightly over the in- termeeting period, with stocks in cyclically sensitive sec- tors generally outperforming. One-month option- implied volatility on the S&P 500—the VIX—reached its lowest level since February 2020 and remained a bit below the middle of its historical distribution. Spreads of yields on corporate bonds over those on comparable- maturity Treasury securities narrowed a little for all credit ratings. Meanwhile, yields on municipal bonds reached historical lows, with spreads roughly unchanged for high-credit-rated bonds and moderately narrower for lower-credit-rated bonds. Short-term funding markets continued to function smoothly over the intermeeting period. Short-term and overnight rates remained near historical lows, with over- night rates dipping slightly. The EFFR was nearly con- stant throughout the period at 6 basis points, while the SOFR remained at 1 basis point. With rates low and net Treasury bill supply contracting, government money market funds, which at the same time were attracting no- table inflows, had limited investment options at nonnegative rates. As a result, ON RRP take-up by these funds surged, pushing total ON RRP participation to record levels in late May and June. International financial market participants were focused on news about inflation and monetary policy communi- cations. In Europe, stronger-than-expected readings for both inflation and economic activity, as well as increased optimism about vaccinations, contributed to a rise in market-based measures of inflation expectations. On net, European longer-term government bond yields were little changed even as U.S. yields declined, and the broad dollar index decreased modestly. In emerging markets, credit spreads narrowed a bit, and capital flows into EME funds continued at a moderate pace. Equity indexes increased somewhat in both emerging and ad- vanced foreign economies. Financing conditions for nonfinancial firms through capital markets remained highly accommodative, as re- flected in historically low corporate bond and leveraged loan yields as well as high price-to-earnings ratios in the equity markets. Gross issuance of corporate bonds and leveraged loans was solid. Equity raised through tradi- tional initial public offerings was robust in April but sof- tened to more moderate levels in May and through mid- June, while the pace of seasoned equity offerings was modest over the intermeeting period. Meanwhile, equity issuance through special purpose acquisition companies slowed markedly. Commercial and industrial (C&I) loans outstanding at banks fell through mid-May, with forgiveness of Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans continuing to drive balances down and more than offsetting volumes of new loan originations. Tepid de- mand for loans appears to have been a factor in the de- cline in loans outstanding. For instance, despite healthy growth in C&I commitments at large banks over the first quarter, there was no corresponding change in the utili- zation rates of credit lines. The credit quality of large nonfinancial corporations re- mained largely stable over the intermeeting period. The Minutes of the Meeting of June 15–16, 2021 Page 7 _____________________________________________________________________________________________ volume of credit rating upgrades for nonfinancial bonds and leveraged loans outpaced downgrades somewhat in the April-to-early-June period. There were no reported corporate defaults in April, and defaults were low in May. Delinquency rates on bank C&I loans also re- mained low in the first quarter. Market indicators of fu- ture default expectations were little changed and re- mained low relative to their historical range. In the municipal bond market, financing conditions re- mained accommodative over the intermeeting period. Issuance of municipal bonds was solid in recent months, and indicators of the credit quality of municipal debt showed some signs of improvement, with the volume of bond upgrades outpacing the volume of bond down- grades. Financing conditions for small businesses were little changed, with supply of small business loans remaining tight and demand still subdued outside of the PPP. While small business loan originations rose in April, sur- passing pre-pandemic levels, loans made under the PPP likely accounted for a significant portion of that growth. Loan performance and other indicators of the financial health of small businesses improved in recent months. However, in certain sectors, such as accommodation and food services, small businesses remained stressed. For commercial real estate (CRE) financed through cap- ital markets, financing conditions remained mostly ac- commodative over the intermeeting period. Issuance of commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) was solid in recent months except in the retail and hotel sec- tors. Spreads of agency CMBS narrowed to below pre- pandemic levels. Meanwhile, spreads on non-agency triple-A CMBS were little changed at accommodative levels, while non-agency triple-B spreads remained ele- vated. CRE loan growth at banks continued to be weak through mid-May, likely reflecting weak demand as well as tight underwriting standards. In the residential mortgage market, financing conditions were little changed over the intermeeting period and re- mained accommodative for stronger borrowers who met standard conforming loan criteria. Credit continued to appear tight for borrowers with lower credit scores. Mortgage rates for most borrowers were little changed, on net, and remained near historical lows. Home-pur- chase and refinance mortgage activity continued at a strong pace through early June. The share of mortgages in forbearance declined in May. Financing conditions for consumer credit remained gen- erally accommodative. Consumer loans grew at a robust pace in April, driven by rapid growth in auto loan bal- ances. Credit card balances on banks’ books rose in May, reversing an April decline. For subprime borrow- ers, conditions in the credit card market appeared to have eased somewhat further from the tight conditions seen after the onset of the pandemic. Conditions in the asset-backed securities market continued to be support- ive of lending during the intermeeting period. Staff Economic Outlook The U.S. economic projection prepared by the staff for the June FOMC meeting was stronger than the April forecast. Real GDP growth was projected to increase substantially this year, with a correspondingly rapid de- cline in the unemployment rate. Further reductions in social distancing and favorable financial conditions were expected to support output growth, even though the ef- fects of fiscal stimulus on economic growth were start- ing to unwind. With the boost to growth from contin- ued reductions in social distancing assumed to fade after 2021 and the further unwinding of fiscal stimulus, GDP growth was expected to step down in 2022 and 2023. Nevertheless, with monetary policy assumed to remain highly accommodative, the staff continued to anticipate that real GDP growth would outpace that of potential over most of this period, leading to a decline in the un- employment rate to historically low levels. The staff’s near-term outlook for inflation was revised up markedly, but the staff continued to expect the rise in inflation this year to be transitory. The 12-month change in total and core PCE prices had moved well above 2 percent in April, and incoming CPI data sug- gested that PCE price inflation would remain high in May. The recent 12-month measures of inflation were being boosted significantly by the base effects of the drop in prices from the spring of 2020 rolling out of the calculation. In addition, the surge in demand as the economy reopened further, combined with production bottlenecks and supply constraints, contributed to the large recent monthly price increases. The staff expected the 12-month change in PCE prices to gradually move down in coming months, reflecting, importantly, the fading of base effects along with smaller expected monthly price increases, but PCE price inflation was forecast to still be well above 2 percent at the end of this year. Over the next year, the transitory price increases caused by bottlenecks and supply constraints were ex- pected to largely reverse, and the growth in demand was forecast to ease. As a result, inflation was projected to slow to slightly below 2 percent in 2022 before moving back up to a bit above 2 percent in 2023, supported by high levels of resource utilization. Page 8 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ The staff continued to see the uncertainty surrounding the economic outlook as elevated, although increasingly widespread vaccinations, along with ongoing policy sup- port, were viewed as helping to diminish some of these uncertainties. Nevertheless, the staff judged that the risks around their strong baseline projection for eco- nomic activity were still tilted somewhat to the down- side, as adverse alternative courses of the pandemic— including the possibility of the spread of more-conta- gious, more-vaccine-resistant COVID-19 variants— seemed more likely than outcomes that would be more favorable than in the baseline forecast. The staff contin- ued to view the risks around the inflation projection as roughly balanced. On the upside, bottlenecks, supply disruptions, and historically high rates of resource utili- zation were seen as potential sources of greater-than- expected inflationary pressures, particularly if there were a significant rise in inflation expectations that altered in- flation dynamics. On the downside, if the effects of sup- ply constraints proved to be transitory, as expected, then the inflation record from the past 25 years suggested the possibility that low underlying trend inflation and a flat Phillips curve could cause inflation to revert to relatively low levels despite a strengthening economy. Participants’ Views on Current Economic Condi- tions and the Economic Outlook In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, participants submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and infla- tion for each year from 2021 through 2023 and over the longer run, based on their individual assessments of ap- propriate monetary policy, including the path of the fed- eral funds rate. The longer-run projections represented each participant’s assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, un- der appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy. A Summary of Eco- nomic Projections was released to the public following the conclusion of the meeting. In their discussion of current conditions, participants noted that progress on vaccinations had reduced the spread of COVID-19 in the United States. Amid this progress and strong policy support, indicators of eco- nomic activity and employment had strengthened. The sectors most adversely affected by the pandemic re- mained weak but had shown improvement. Inflation had risen, largely reflecting transitory factors. Overall financial conditions remained accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses. Participants generally noted that the path of the econ- omy would depend significantly on the course of the vi- rus. Progress on vaccinations would likely continue to reduce the effects of the public health crisis on the econ- omy, but risks to the economic outlook remained. Participants observed that economic activity was ex- panding at a historically rapid pace, led by robust gains in consumer spending. A vast majority of participants revised up their projections for real GDP growth this year compared with the projections they had submitted in March, citing stronger consumer demand and im- provements in vaccination rates as the primary reasons for these upgrades. That said, participants generally saw supply disruptions and labor shortages as constraining the expansion of economic activity this year. Partici- pants’ projections of real GDP growth in 2022 and 2023 were generally little changed. In their discussion of the household sector, participants remarked that indicators of consumer spending had con- tinued to surge and expected that further gains in spend- ing would contribute significantly to the economic re- covery. Many participants commented that accommo- dative financial conditions, the release of pent-up de- mand, progress on widespread vaccination, the ongoing reduction of social-distancing measures, and fiscal stim- ulus were important factors supporting spending. Some participants also noted that consumer spending would likely continue to be bolstered by the ongoing effects from these factors as well as by households’ elevated level of accumulated savings and generally healthy bal- ance sheets. A majority of participants observed that housing market activity remained strong. With respect to the business sector, most participants noted that activity in the service industries most ad- versely affected by the pandemic, such as in the leisure and hospitality sector, was rebounding as the economy reopened. A number of participants noted that business equipment investment was rising at a strong pace, but growth in manufacturing activity was being restrained by production bottlenecks and supply constraints. In addi- tion, participants reported hearing from contacts in a broad range of industries that shortages of materials and labor as well as supply chain challenges were limiting the ability of firms to keep up with demand. Some business contacts indicated that they were responding to input shortages and bottlenecks by canceling shifts, raising compensation to attract and retain workers, raising prices, or focusing on cutting costs and increasing productivity, particularly through automation. Minutes of the Meeting of June 15–16, 2021 Page 9 _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Participants commented on the continued improvement in labor market conditions in recent months. Job gains in April and May averaged more than 400,000, and the unemployment rate edged down, on net, to 5.8 percent over the period. Many participants pointed to the ele- vated number of job openings and high rates of job switching as further evidence of the improvement in la- bor market conditions. Many participants remarked, however, that the economy was still far from achieving the Committee’s broad-based and inclusive maximum- employment goal, and some participants indicated that recent job gains, while strong, were weaker than they had expected. A number of participants noted that the labor market recovery continued to be uneven across demo- graphic and income groups and across sectors. Participants noted that their District contacts had re- ported having trouble hiring workers to meet demand, likely reflecting factors such as early retirements, con- cerns about the virus, childcare responsibilities, and ex- panded unemployment insurance benefits. Some partic- ipants remarked that these factors were making people either less able or less inclined to work in the current environment. Citing recent wage data and reports from business contacts, many participants judged that labor shortages were putting upward pressure on wages or leading employers to provide additional financial incen- tives to attract and retain workers, particularly in lower- wage occupations. Participants expected labor market conditions to continue to improve, with labor shortages expected to ease throughout the summer and into the fall as progress on vaccinations continues, social distanc- ing unwinds further, more schools reopen, and ex- panded unemployment insurance benefits expire. In their discussions on inflation, participants stated that they had expected inflation to move above 2 percent in the near term, in part as the drop in prices from early in the pandemic fell out of the calculation and past in- creases in oil prices passed through to consumer energy prices. However, participants remarked that the actual rise in inflation was larger than anticipated, with the 12-month change in the PCE price index reaching 3.6 percent in April. Participants attributed the upside surprise to more widespread supply constraints in prod- uct and labor markets than they had anticipated and to a larger-than-expected surge in consumer demand as the economy reopened. They noted that many of their Dis- trict contacts had reported that higher input costs were putting upward pressure on prices. Most participants observed that the largest contributors to the rise in meas- ured inflation were sectors affected by supply bottle- necks or sectors where price levels were rebounding from levels depressed by the pandemic. Looking ahead, participants generally expected inflation to ease as the effect of these transitory factors dissipated, but several participants remarked that they anticipated that supply chain limitations and input shortages would put upward pressure on prices into next year. Several participants noted that, during the early months of the reopening, uncertainty remained too high to accurately assess how long inflation pressures will be sustained. Some partici- pants commented that recent readings of inflation measures that exclude volatile components, such as trimmed mean measures, had been relatively stable at or just below 2 percent. In their comments on longer-term inflation expectations, a number of participants noted that, despite increases earlier this year, measures of longer-term inflation expectations had remained in ranges that were broadly consistent with the Commit- tee’s longer-run inflation goal. Others noted that it was this year’s increases that had brought these measures to levels that were broadly consistent with the Committee’s longer-run inflation goal. Participants noted that overall financial conditions re- mained highly accommodative, in part reflecting the stance of monetary policy, which continued to deliver appropriate support to the economy. Several partici- pants highlighted, however, that low interest rates were contributing to elevated house prices and that valuation pressures in housing markets might pose financial stabil- ity risks. In discussing the uncertainty and risks associated with the economic outlook, participants commented that the process of reopening the economy was unprecedented and likely to be uneven across sectors. Some partici- pants judged that supply chain disruptions and labor shortages complicated the task of assessing progress to- ward the Committee’s goals and that the speed at which these factors would dissipate was uncertain. Accord- ingly, participants judged that uncertainty around their economic projections was elevated. Although they gen- erally saw the risks to the outlook for economic activity as broadly balanced, a substantial majority of partici- pants judged that the risks to their inflation projections were tilted to the upside because of concerns that supply disruptions and labor shortages might linger for longer and might have larger or more persistent effects on prices and wages than they currently assumed. Several participants expressed concern that longer-term infla- tion expectations might rise to inappropriate levels if el- evated inflation readings persisted. Several other partic- ipants cautioned that downside risks to inflation re- Page 10 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ mained because temporary price pressures might un- wind faster than currently anticipated and because the forces that held down inflation and inflation expecta- tions during the previous economic expansion had not gone away or might reinforce the effect of the unwind- ing of temporary price pressures. In their consideration of the stance of monetary policy, participants reaffirmed the Federal Reserve’s commit- ment to using its full range of tools to support the U.S. economy during this challenging time, thereby promot- ing the Committee’s statutory goals of maximum em- ployment and price stability. Participants generally agreed that the economic recovery was incomplete and that risks to the economic outlook remained. Although inflation had risen more than anticipated, the increase was seen as largely reflecting temporary factors, and par- ticipants expected inflation to decline toward the Com- mittee’s 2 percent longer-run objective. Participants judged that the current stance of monetary policy and policy guidance remained appropriate to pro- mote maximum employment as well as to achieve infla- tion that averages 2 percent over time and longer-term inflation expectations that are well anchored at 2 per- cent. Participants also reiterated that the existing out- come-based guidance implied that the paths of the fed- eral funds rate and the balance sheet would depend on actual progress toward reaching the Committee’s maxi- mum-employment and inflation goals. In light of the incoming data and the implications for their economic outlooks, a few participants mentioned that they ex- pected the economic conditions set out in the Commit- tee’s forward guidance for the federal funds rate to be met somewhat earlier than they had projected in March. Several participants emphasized, however, that uncer- tainty around the economic outlook was elevated and that it was too early to draw firm conclusions about the paths of the labor market and inflation. In their view, this heightened uncertainty regarding the evolution of the economy also implied significant uncertainty about the appropriate path of the federal funds rate. Some par- ticipants noted that communications about the appro- priate path of policy would be a focus of market partici- pants in the current environment and commented that it would be important to emphasize that the Committee’s reaction function or commitment to its monetary policy framework had not changed. Participants discussed the Federal Reserve’s asset pur- chases and progress toward the Committee’s goals since last December when the Committee adopted its guid- ance for asset purchases. The Committee’s standard of “substantial further progress” was generally seen as not having yet been met, though participants expected pro- gress to continue. Various participants mentioned that they expected the conditions for beginning to reduce the pace of asset purchases to be met somewhat earlier than they had anticipated at previous meetings in light of in- coming data. Some participants saw the incoming data as providing a less clear signal about the underlying eco- nomic momentum and judged that the Committee would have information in coming months to make a better assessment of the path of the labor market and inflation. As a result, several of these participants em- phasized that the Committee should be patient in as- sessing progress toward its goals and in announcing changes to its plans for asset purchases. Participants generally judged that, as a matter of prudent planning, it was important to be well positioned to reduce the pace of asset purchases, if appropriate, in response to unex- pected economic developments, including faster-than- anticipated progress toward the Committee’s goals or the emergence of risks that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals. Various participants offered their views on the Commit- tee’s agency MBS purchases. Several participants saw benefits to reducing the pace of these purchases more quickly or earlier than Treasury purchases in light of val- uation pressures in housing markets. Several other par- ticipants, however, commented that reducing the pace of Treasury and MBS purchases commensurately was preferable because this approach would be well aligned with the Committee’s previous communications or be- cause purchases of Treasury securities and MBS both provide accommodation through their influence on broader financial conditions. In coming meetings, par- ticipants agreed to continue assessing the economy’s progress toward the Committee’s goals and to begin to discuss their plans for adjusting the path and composi- tion of asset purchases. In addition, participants reiter- ated their intention to provide notice well in advance of an announcement to reduce the pace of purchases. With regard to the implementation of monetary policy, participants had observed downward pressure on money market rates over the intermeeting period and viewed the possibility of further downward pressure on these rates in the near term as likely. Consequently, they noted that an adjustment to the Federal Reserve’s administered rates would help keep the federal funds rate well within the target range and support smooth market functioning of short-term funding markets. Participants agreed that Minutes of the Meeting of June 15–16, 2021 Page 11 _____________________________________________________________________________________________ this technical adjustment had no bearing on the appro- priate path for the federal funds rate or the stance of monetary policy. Committee Policy Action In their discussion of monetary policy for this meeting, members agreed that progress on vaccinations had re- duced the spread of COVID-19 in the United States. They noted that amid progress and strong policy sup- port, indicators of economic activity and employment had strengthened. Although the sectors most adversely affected by the pandemic remained weak, they had shown improvement. Inflation had risen, largely reflect- ing transitory factors. Overall financial conditions re- mained accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses. Members also agreed that the path of the economy would depend sig- nificantly on the course of the virus. Progress on vac- cinations would likely continue to reduce the effects of the public health crisis on the economy, but risks to the economic outlook remained. Members agreed that the Federal Reserve was commit- ted to using its full range of tools to support the U.S. economy in this challenging time, thereby promoting its maximum-employment and price-stability goals. All members reaffirmed that, in accordance with the Com- mittee’s goals to achieve maximum employment and in- flation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run and with inflation having run persistently below this longer- run goal, they would aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and longer-term inflation expecta- tions remain well anchored at 2 percent. Members ex- pected to maintain an accommodative stance of mone- tary policy until those outcomes were achieved. All members agreed to keep the target range for the fed- eral funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent, and they expected that it would be appropriate to maintain this target range un- til labor market conditions had reached levels consistent with the Committee’s assessments of maximum employ- ment and inflation had risen to 2 percent and was on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time. In addition, members agreed that it would be appropriate for the Federal Reserve to continue to increase its hold- ings of Treasury securities by at least $80 billion per month and agency MBS by at least $40 billion per month until substantial further progress had been made toward the Committee’s maximum-employment and price-sta- bility goals. They judged that these asset purchases would help foster smooth market functioning and ac- commodative financial conditions, thereby supporting the flow of credit to households and businesses. Members agreed that, in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, they would continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and that they would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate in the event that risks emerged that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals. Members also concurred that, in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, they would take into account a wide range of information, in- cluding readings on public health, labor market condi- tions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments. Members judged that the economic outlook had contin- ued to improve and that the most negative effects of the pandemic on the economy most likely had occurred. As a result, they agreed to remove references in the FOMC statement that noted that the virus was “causing tremen- dous human and economic hardship” and that “the on- going public health crisis continues to weigh on the economy.” Instead, they agreed to say that progress on vaccinations had reduced the spread of COVID-19 and would likely continue to reduce the negative economic effects of the public health crisis. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the fol- lowing domestic policy directive, for release at 2:00 p.m.: “Effective June 17, 2021, the Federal Open Market Committee directs the Desk to: • Undertake open market operations as nec- essary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of 0 to ¼ percent. • Increase the System Open Market Ac- count holdings of Treasury securities by $80 billion per month and of agency mort- gage-backed securities (MBS) by $40 bil- lion per month. • Increase holdings of Treasury securities and agency MBS by additional amounts and purchase agency commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) as needed to sustain smooth functioning of markets for these securities. Page 12 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ • Conduct repurchase agreement operations to support effective policy implementation and the smooth functioning of short-term U.S. dollar funding markets. • Conduct overnight reverse repurchase agreement operations at an offering rate of 0.05 percent and with a per-counterparty limit of $80 billion per day; the per- counterparty limit can be temporarily in- creased at the discretion of the Chair. • Roll over at auction all principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of Treasury securities and reinvest all princi- pal payments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of agency debt and agency MBS in agency MBS. • Allow modest deviations from stated amounts for purchases and reinvestments, if needed for operational reasons. • Engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settle- ment of the Federal Reserve’s agency MBS transactions.” The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below for release at 2:00 p.m.: “The Federal Reserve is committed to using its full range of tools to support the U.S. economy in this challenging time, thereby promoting its maximum employment and price stability goals. Progress on vaccinations has reduced the spread of COVID-19 in the United States. Amid this progress and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employ- ment have strengthened. The sectors most ad- versely affected by the pandemic remain weak but have shown improvement. Inflation has risen, largely reflecting transitory factors. Over- all financial conditions remain accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. house- holds and businesses. The path of the economy will depend signifi- cantly on the course of the virus. Progress on vaccinations will likely continue to reduce the effects of the public health crisis on the econ- omy, but risks to the economic outlook remain. The Committee seeks to achieve maximum em- ployment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. With inflation having run persistently below this longer-run goal, the Committee will aim to achieve inflation moder- ately above 2 percent for some time so that in- flation averages 2 percent over time and longer‑term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent. The Committee expects to maintain an accommodative stance of mone- tary policy until these outcomes are achieved. The Committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and expects it will be appropriate to maintain this target range until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee’s assessments of maximum employment and in- flation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time. In addition, the Federal Reserve will continue to increase its holdings of Treasury securities by at least $80 billion per month and of agency mort- gage‑backed securities by at least $40 billion per month until substantial further progress has been made toward the Committee’s maximum employment and price stability goals. These as- set purchases help foster smooth market func- tioning and accommodative financial condi- tions, thereby supporting the flow of credit to households and businesses. In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals. The Committee’s assessments will take into account a wide range of information, in- cluding readings on public health, labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation ex- pectations, and financial and international de- velopments.” Voting for this action: Jerome H. Powell, John C. Williams, Thomas I. Barkin, Raphael W. Bostic, Michelle W. Bowman, Lael Brainard, Richard H. Clarida, Mary C. Daly, Charles L. Evans, Randal K. Quarles, and Christopher J. Waller. Voting against this action: None. Minutes of the Meeting of June 15–16, 2021 Page 13 _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Consistent with the Committee’s decision to leave the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged, the Board of Governors voted unanimously to raise the in- terest rates on required and excess reserve balances to 0.15 percent. Setting the interest rate paid on required and excess reserve balances 15 basis points above the bottom of the target range for the federal funds rate is intended to foster trading in the federal funds market at rates well within the Federal Open Market Committee’s target range and to support the smooth functioning of short-term funding markets. The Board of Governors also voted unanimously to approve establishment of the primary credit rate at the existing level of 0.25 percent, effective June 17, 2021. It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Tuesday–Wednesday, July 27– 28, 2021. The meeting adjourned at 10:40 a.m. on June 16, 2021. Notation Vote By notation vote completed on May 18, 2021, the Com- mittee unanimously approved the minutes of the Com- mittee meeting held on April 27–28, 2021. _______________________ James A.

Although there were notable moves in some asset prices over the intermeeting period, overall financial conditions ended the period little changed at historically accommodative levels. Market participants seemed to interpret communications associ- ated with the June FOMC meeting as signaling a less ac- commodative path of monetary policy than had been an- ticipated. Implied rates on interest rate futures initially rose following the meeting but subsequently retraced, and expectations regarding the path of the target federal funds rate over the next few years ended the period only modestly changed. Longer-term yields fell notably over the period, with the declines concentrated in far-forward rates. A significant portion of these movements seemed to reflect changes in term premiums. Market participants pointed to a number of factors as driving the movement in longer- term yields, most prominently including Federal Reserve policy communications, investor positioning, and changes in expectations regarding the course of the pan- demic. With respect to the path of net asset purchases, respond- ents to the Open Market Desk’s surveys of primary deal- ers and market participants expected communications on asset purchases to evolve gradually, with signals an- ticipated over coming months regarding both the Com- mittee’s assessment of conditions constituting “substan- Page 2 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ tial further progress” and details on tapering plans. Al- most 60 percent of respondents anticipated the first re- duction in the pace of net asset purchases to come in January, though, on average, respondents placed some- what more weight than in the June surveys on the possi- bility of tapering beginning somewhat earlier. With re- spect to the pace of tapering, respondents continued to anticipate that the Committee would take a gradual ap- proach. While market participants discussed the possi- bility of an earlier or faster-than-proportional reduction in the pace of net purchases of agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS), most survey respondents appeared to expect the timing and pace of tapering of net purchases of agency MBS and Treasury securities to be similar. The manager turned next to a discussion of develop- ments in operations and money markets over the period. Following the June meeting, overnight rates rose in line with the technical adjustment in administered rates and were relatively stable for the remainder of the period. Overnight reverse repurchase agreement (ON RRP) take-up jumped by over $200 billion after the technical adjustment took effect, as government-sponsored enter- prises moved balances held in unremunerated Federal Reserve deposit accounts into the higher-yielding ON RRP investments. Government money market funds also increased their participation in the facility amid a continued decline in Treasury bills outstanding and downward pressure on overnight rates. Overall, market participants reported that the technical adjustment went smoothly and that, with overnight rates having moved further away from zero, concerns about the functioning of short-term funding markets had diminished. Looking ahead, market participants were beginning to focus on the potential effects of changes in the Treasury General Account at the Federal Reserve and Treasury bill issuance over coming months in connection with the debt ceiling. The manager noted that, if a number of counterparties reached the per-counterparty limit on their ON RRP investments and downward pressure on overnight rates emerged, it may become appropriate to lift the limit. Establishment of Standing Repurchase Agreement Facilities Finally, the manager summarized the proposed terms for the standing repurchase agreement (repo) facility (SRF) and the Foreign and International Monetary Authorities (FIMA) Repo Facility. In questions and comments fol- lowing the manager’s briefing, participants expressed broad support for the establishment of the SRF and FIMA Repo Facility. The vast majority of participants supported the proposed terms, although a few partici- pants raised questions, including whether the proposed aggregate cap of $500 billion was necessary, whether the collateral eligible in SRF operations should be limited to Treasury securities only, and how the setting of the min- imum bid rate in SRF operations would be expected to evolve over time relative to the primary credit rate and the interest on reserve balances rate. In general, partici- pants viewed the SRF and FIMA Repo Facility as im- portant new tools, serving in backstop roles, that would support effective policy implementation and smooth market functioning. Participants anticipated that the Committee would learn more about how these facilities operate over time and noted that it could adjust some parameters of the facilities on the basis of that experi- ence. The Committee voted unanimously to approve the es- tablishment of the SRF. All but one member of the Committee voted to approve the FIMA Repo Facility. Governor Bowman abstained from voting on the FIMA Repo Facility and noted that she would have preferred that the liquidity arrangements accessible to foreign of- ficial institutions be maintained only during periods of extraordinary financial market stress rather than through a standing facility. Standing Repurchase Agreement Facility Resolu- tion The Federal Open Market Committee (the “Commit- tee”) authorizes and directs the Open Market Desk at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (the “Selected Bank”), for the System Open Market Account (“SOMA”), to conduct operations in which it offers to purchase securities, subject to an agreement to resell (“repurchase agreement transactions”). The repurchase agreement transactions hereby authorized and directed shall (i) include only U.S. Treasury securities, agency debt securities, and agency mortgage-backed securities; (ii) be conducted as open market operations with pri- mary dealers and depository institutions as participants; (iii) be conducted with a minimum bid rate of 0.25 per- cent; (iv) be offered on an overnight basis (except that the Open Market Desk at the Selected Bank may extend the term for longer than an overnight term to accommo- date weekend, holiday, and similar trading conventions); and (v) be subject to an aggregate operation limit of $500 billion. The aggregate operation limit can be tem- porarily increased at the discretion of the Chair. These operations shall be conducted by the Open Market Desk at the Selected Bank until otherwise directed by the Committee. _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Minutes of the Meeting of July 27–28, 2021 Page 3 Standing FIMA Repurchase Agreement Resolution The Federal Open Market Committee (the “Commit- tee”) authorizes and directs the Open Market Desk at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (the “Selected Bank”), for the System Open Market Account (“SOMA”), to offer to purchase U.S. Treasury securities subject to an agreement to resell (“repurchase agreement transactions”) with foreign central bank and interna- tional accounts maintained at a Federal Reserve Bank (the “Foreign Accounts”). The repurchase agreement transactions hereby authorized and directed shall (i) in- clude only U.S. Treasury securities; (ii) be conducted with Foreign Accounts approved in advance by the For- eign Currency Subcommittee (the “Subcommittee”); (iii) be conducted at an offering rate of 0.25 percent; (iv) be offered on an overnight basis (except that the Open Market Desk at the Selected Bank may extend the term for longer than an overnight term to accommodate weekend, holiday, and similar trading conventions); and (v) be subject to a per-counterparty limit of $60 billion per day. The Subcommittee may approve changes in the offering rate, the maturity of the transactions, eligible Foreign Accounts counterparties (either by approving or removing account access), and the counterparty limit; and the Subcommittee shall keep the Committee in- formed of any such changes. These transactions shall be undertaken by the Open Market Desk at the Selected Bank until otherwise directed by the Committee. The Open Market Desk at the Selected Bank will also report at least annually to the Committee on facility usage and the list of approved account holders. By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk’s domestic transactions over the intermeeting period. There were no intervention operations in foreign curren- cies for the System’s account during the intermeeting pe- riod. Discussion of Asset Purchases Participants discussed aspects of the Federal Reserve’s asset purchases, including progress made toward the Committee’s maximum-employment and price-stability goals since the adoption of the asset purchase guidance in December 2020. They also considered the question of how asset purchases might be adjusted once eco- nomic conditions met the standards of that guidance. Participants agreed that their discussion at this meeting would be helpful background for the Committee’s future decisions about modifying asset purchases. No deci- sions regarding future adjustments to asset purchases were made at this meeting. The participants’ discussion was preceded by staff presentations that reviewed the principal channels through which asset purchases exert effects on financial conditions and the economy, with a focus on the impli- cations of these channels for the Committee’s delibera- tions regarding future adjustments to the Federal Re- serve’s asset purchases. The presentations noted that, in the staff’s standard empirical modeling framework, the effect of asset purchases on financial and economic con- ditions occurred primarily via their influence on the ex- pected path of private-sector holdings of longer-term as- sets. In that framework, larger Federal Reserve holdings of these assets reduced private-sector holdings, exerting downward pressure on term premiums and, conse- quently, keeping longer-term interest rates and overall fi- nancial conditions more accommodative than they oth- erwise would be. The staff noted that, because plausible alternative approaches to the tapering of asset purchases would likely not lead to significant differences in the ex- pected path of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet, these approaches would have similar financial and economic effects in the staff’s standard framework. The presenta- tions highlighted, however, that alternative tapering ap- proaches could have significant financial and economic effects not fully captured in the staff’s standard empirical framework. In particular, changes in asset purchases could be interpreted by the public as signaling a shift in the Committee’s view of the economic outlook or in its overall policy strategy, with implications for the ex- pected path of the federal funds rate. Changes in the flow of asset purchases could also influence yields, but this influence would likely be modest outside of periods of stressed financial market conditions. In their discussion of considerations related to asset pur- chases, various participants noted that these purchases were an important part of the monetary policy toolkit and a critical aspect of the Federal Reserve’s response to the economic effects of the pandemic, supporting smooth financial market functioning and accommoda- tive financial conditions, which aided the flow of credit to households and businesses and supported the recov- ery. Participants discussed a broad range of labor market and inflation indicators. All participants assessed that the economy had made progress toward the Commit- tee’s maximum-employment and price-stability goals since the adoption of the guidance on asset purchases in December. Most participants judged that the Commit- tee’s standard of “substantial further progress” toward the maximum-employment goal had not yet been met. At the same time, most participants remarked that this standard had been achieved with respect to the price- Page 4 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ stability goal. A few participants noted, however, that the transitory nature of this year’s rise in inflation, as well as the recent declines in longer-term yields and in mar- ket-based measures of inflation compensation, cast doubt on the degree of progress that had been made to- ward the price-stability goal since December. Looking ahead, most participants noted that, provided that the economy were to evolve broadly as they anticipated, they judged that it could be appropriate to start reducing the pace of asset purchases this year because they saw the Committee’s “substantial further progress” criterion as satisfied with respect to the price-stability goal and as close to being satisfied with respect to the maximum- employment goal. Various participants commented that economic and financial conditions would likely warrant a reduction in coming months. Several others indicated, however, that a reduction in the pace of asset purchases was more likely to become appropriate early next year because they saw prevailing conditions in the labor mar- ket as not being close to meeting the Committee’s “sub- stantial further progress” standard or because of uncer- tainty about the degree of progress toward the price-sta- bility goal. Participants agreed that the Committee would provide advance notice before making changes to its balance sheet policy. Participants expressed a range of views on the appropri- ate pace of tapering asset purchases once economic con- ditions satisfied the criterion laid out in the Committee’s guidance. Many participants saw potential benefits in a pace of tapering that would end net asset purchases be- fore the conditions currently specified in the Commit- tee’s forward guidance on the federal funds rate were likely to be met. At the same time, participants indicated that the standards for raising the target range for the fed- eral funds rate were distinct from those associated with tapering asset purchases and remarked that the timing of those actions would depend on the course of the econ- omy. Several participants noted that an earlier start to tapering could be accompanied by more gradual reduc- tions in the purchase pace and that such a combination could mitigate the risk of an excessive tightening in fi- nancial conditions in response to a tapering announce- ment. Participants exchanged views on what the composition of asset purchases should be during the tapering process. Most participants remarked that they saw benefits in re- ducing the pace of net purchases of Treasury securities and agency MBS proportionally in order to end both sets of purchases at the same time. These participants ob- served that such an approach would be consistent with the Committee’s understanding that purchases of Treas- ury securities and agency MBS had similar effects on broader financial conditions and played similar roles in the transmission of monetary policy, or that these pur- chases were not intended as credit allocation. Some of these participants remarked, however, that they wel- comed further discussion of the appropriate composi- tion of asset purchases during the tapering process. Sev- eral participants commented on the benefits that they saw in reducing agency MBS purchases more quickly than Treasury securities purchases, noting that the hous- ing sector was exceptionally strong and did not need ei- ther actual or perceived support from the Federal Re- serve in the form of agency MBS purchases or that such purchases could be interpreted as a type of credit alloca- tion. Participants commented on other factors that were rele- vant for their consideration of future adjustments to the pace of asset purchases. Many participants noted that, when a reduction in the pace of asset purchases became appropriate, it would be important that the Committee clearly reaffirm the absence of any mechanical link be- tween the timing of tapering and that of an eventual in- crease in the target range for the federal funds rate. A few participants suggested that the Committee would need to be mindful of the risk that a tapering announce- ment that was perceived to be premature could bring into question the Committee’s commitment to its new monetary policy framework. With respect to the effects of the pandemic, several participants indicated that they would adjust their views on the appropriate path of asset purchases if the economic effects of new strains of the virus turned out to be notably worse than currently an- ticipated and significantly hindered progress toward the Committee’s goals. Staff Review of the Economic Situation The information available at the time of the July 27–28 meeting suggested that U.S. real gross domestic product (GDP) had increased in the second quarter at a faster pace than in the first quarter of the year. Indicators of labor market conditions were mixed in June, though la- bor demand remained strong. Consumer price inflation through May—as measured by the 12-month percentage change in the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index—had picked up notably, largely reflecting transitory factors. Total nonfarm payroll employment rose sharply in June, with job gains widespread across industries and espe- cially strong job growth in the leisure and hospitality sec- tor. As of June, total payroll employment had retraced _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Minutes of the Meeting of July 27–28, 2021 Page 5 more than two-thirds of the losses seen at the onset of the pandemic. The unemployment rate edged higher and stood at 5.9 percent in June, and the unemployment rates for African Americans and Hispanics remained well above the national average. The labor force partic- ipation rate and employment-to-population ratio were unchanged in June. May private-sector job openings, as measured by the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Sur- vey, remained at the highest recorded level since the sur- vey’s inception in 2000. Initial claims for regular state unemployment insurance were little changed, on net, since mid-June. Weekly estimates of private-sector pay- rolls constructed by Federal Reserve Board staff using data provided by the payroll processor ADP that were available through the first part of July suggested that the pace of private employment gains had remained strong. Average hourly earnings for all employees rose further in June. Recent monthly increases in average hourly earnings appeared to reflect a combination of strong la- bor demand and increased difficulties in hiring that had more than offset the downward pressure on average earnings from disproportionately large employment gains in lower-wage industries. Information from com- pensation measures that were judged to be less affected by shifts in the composition of the workforce was mixed: A staff measure of the 12-month change in the median wage derived from the ADP data had stepped up notice- ably in June relative to earlier in the year; by contrast, the Wage Growth Tracker measure constructed by the Fed- eral Reserve Bank of Atlanta had not shown a similar pickup. Recent 12-month change measures of inflation, using ei- ther PCE prices or the consumer price index (CPI), had been boosted by base effects as the extremely low infla- tion readings from the spring of 2020 rolled out of the calculation. In addition, a surge in demand as the econ- omy reopened further, combined with production bot- tlenecks and supply constraints, had pushed up recent monthly price increases. Total PCE price inflation was 3.9 percent over the 12 months ending in May, and core PCE price inflation, which excludes changes in con- sumer energy prices and many consumer food prices, was 3.4 percent over the 12 months ending in May. In contrast, the trimmed mean measure of 12-month PCE inflation constructed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas was 1.9 percent in May. In June, the 12-month change in the CPI was 5.4 percent, while the core CPI rose 4.5 percent over the same period. In the second quarter of 2021, the staff’s common inflation expecta- tions index, which combines information from many in- dicators of inflation expectations and inflation compen- sation, had more than reversed the moderate decline rec- orded in the middle of last year and had returned to the level that prevailed in 2014, when actual inflation was relatively modest. Real PCE appeared to have risen in the second quarter at a pace similar to that seen in the first quarter, sup- ported by previous rounds of federal stimulus payments and reductions in social distancing. Even so, consumer spending appeared to have been held back some as pro- ducers struggled to meet demand. Similarly, despite very strong demand for housing, incoming data suggested that residential investment spending had declined in the second quarter as materials shortages and limited stocks of homes for sale temporarily restrained activity in that sector. Available indicators suggested that growth in business fixed investment had slowed sharply in the second quar- ter, reflecting disruptions to motor vehicle production and aircraft deliveries and a faster rate of decline in non- residential structures investment. Growth in manufacturing output had picked up mod- estly in the second quarter. Although production in the chemicals industry had rebounded from the weather-re- lated disruptions earlier in the year, the supply chain is- sues faced by a number of other industries, particularly the motor vehicle industry, continued to weigh on over- all factory output. Total real government purchases appeared to have moved lower in the second quarter after having risen in the first quarter. Available data suggested that federal nondefense purchases had dropped following a first- quarter surge in pandemic-related expenditures and that defense purchases were little changed. However, indica- tors of real state and local purchases pointed to a modest second-quarter increase in this component of govern- ment spending. The nominal U.S. international trade deficit remained high in May. Real goods imports in May retraced only a bit of their April decline, but they were still at the sec- ond-highest level on record. Real goods exports edged down in May and remained below pre-COVID-19 lev- els. Bottlenecks in the global semiconductor industry continued to weigh on exports and imports of automo- tive products, and shipping congestion likely continued to restrain trade overall. Although international travel recovered further in May, exports and imports of ser- vices remained depressed relative to pre-pandemic lev- els. Page 6 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Incoming data suggested that, after a weak start to the year, foreign economic activity accelerated in the second quarter. The improvements were concentrated in the advanced foreign economies and China, supported by vaccine rollouts, the unwinding of public health re- strictions, economic adaptation to the virus, and the re- opening of the services sector. The situation was quite different in some emerging market economies (EMEs) whose low vaccination rates left them vulnerable to new waves of infections. Although new COVID-19 cases fell dramatically in India after the surge in May and June, the situation deteriorated markedly in several Southeast Asian countries, whose cases and deaths rose to all-time highs. In addition, the increased prevalence of new virus variants, particularly the Delta variant, underscored the continued uncertainty about the foreign outlook. Infla- tion rose further in most foreign economies, reflecting a reversal of price declines seen in the spring of 2020, higher energy and commodity prices, and supply bottle- necks. Staff Review of the Financial Situation Over the intermeeting period, fluctuations in financial markets appeared to be driven by less-accommodative- than-expected June FOMC communications, a reduc- tion in investor perceptions of the risk of persistently high inflation, increased concerns about the rapid spread of the Delta variant, and stronger-than-anticipated infla- tion data. Longer-dated Treasury yields fell, largely re- flecting declines in real yields, while longer-horizon for- ward measures of inflation compensation also declined. Domestic equity prices rose moderately, and corporate bond spreads remained near the low end of their histor- ical ranges. Short-term funding markets were stable, while participation in the ON RRP facility increased fur- ther, to its highest level since the facility was put in place. Market-based financing conditions were accommoda- tive, and bank lending standards eased for most loan cat- egories. The Treasury yield curve flattened, on net, with the 2-year yield about unchanged, the 5-year yield declining a bit, and the 10- and 30-year yields each decreasing about 30 basis points. The decline in longer-term Treas- ury yields was associated with a drop in real yields im- plied by Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS), with the 10-year real yield down about 25 basis points. Meanwhile, shorter-horizon measures of inflation com- pensation ended the period modestly higher, but longer- term forward measures fell notably. On net, the market- implied path of the policy rate was little changed for ho- rizons up to late 2023, while it shifted lower beyond those horizons. Broad stock market prices rose moderately over the in- termeeting period, supported in part by some strong sec- ond-quarter earnings reports that bolstered investor risk sentiment. However, some prices declined for stocks that historically have moved more closely with economic conditions—such as stocks for smaller companies and for firms in cyclical industries—as did stock prices for firms in sectors such as airlines and hotels that were neg- atively affected by the pandemic. Bank stock prices also fell. One-month option-implied volatility on the S&P 500—the VIX—spiked to reach a two-month high. For the intermeeting period as a whole, however, the VIX was little changed, on net, and remained somewhat above its average pre-pandemic levels. Spreads of yields on corporate bonds over those on comparable-maturity Treasury securities were little changed, and spreads of benchmark municipal bond indexes increased moder- ately, although both remained below their pre-pandemic levels. Short-term funding markets were stable over the inter- meeting period. Following the actions at the June FOMC meeting to increase both the interest rate on ex- cess reserves and the ON RRP rate by 5 basis points, the effective federal funds rate rose 4 basis points, reaching 10 basis points, while the Secured Overnight Financing Rate rose 4 basis points, reaching 5 basis points. These funding rates remained at these levels for most of the period. Participation in the Federal Reserve’s ON RRP operations continued to increase to its highest level since the facility was put in place, from an average of $340 bil- lion in the previous intermeeting period to an average of around $800 billion over the current intermeeting pe- riod, and reached almost $1 trillion on the June quarter- end. The increase in participation was driven in part by larger investments from money market funds, as ongo- ing reductions in net Treasury bill issuance contributed to downward pressure on yields of other investment op- tions available to these funds. Concerns about the worldwide spread of the Delta vari- ant weighed somewhat on risk sentiment in global finan- cial markets over the intermeeting period. The dollar broadly appreciated, longer-term yields in major ad- vanced foreign economies decreased notably, and most major foreign equity indexes declined moderately. Eq- uity markets in China and Hong Kong underperformed notably amid increased regulatory uncertainty in China. In addition, EME sovereign credit spreads widened slightly, but capital flows into dedicated EME funds re- mained modestly positive. _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Minutes of the Meeting of July 27–28, 2021 Page 7 Several foreign central banks scaled back their asset pur- chase programs. The Bank of Canada and the Reserve Bank of Australia reduced the pace of their asset pur- chases, and the Reserve Bank of New Zealand unexpect- edly announced that it would halt its asset purchases in July. In emerging markets, the central banks of Brazil and Mexico raised rates in order to reduce inflationary pressures. In contrast, the People’s Bank of China cut the broad reserve requirement ratio for banks to support economic growth. The European Central Bank com- pleted its strategy review, adopting a 2 percent symmet- ric inflation target, and revised forward guidance on its policy rate. Financing conditions faced by nonfinancial firms in cap- ital markets continued to be broadly accommodative over the intermeeting period, as corporate bond spreads remained near the low end of their historical distribu- tions. Gross issuance of corporate bonds slowed from its brisk pace in May but remained solid, and gross issu- ance of leveraged loans was also robust. Equity raised through traditional initial public offerings rebounded noticeably, while equity raised through seasoned equity offerings continued to be moderate in June. Meanwhile, equity issuance through special purpose acquisition companies remained subdued. Commercial and industrial (C&I) loans outstanding at banks continued to decline in June, with forgiveness of Paycheck Protection Program loans more than offset- ting the volumes of new loan originations. In the July Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices (SLOOS), banks reported easing standards and nearly all terms, on net, for C&I loans over the second quarter. The July SLOOS also indicated that the level of standards on C&I loans returned to the easier end of the range that had prevailed since 2005. Banks surveyed in the July SLOOS reported that demand for C&I loans had improved over the second quarter; however, market commentary suggested that demand was still generally weak. The credit quality of large nonfinancial corporations re- mained stable over the intermeeting period. The volume of credit rating upgrades for nonfinancial corporate bonds and leveraged loans moderately outpaced down- grades in June. Corporate bond and leveraged loan de- faults also remained low. Financing conditions in the municipal bond market re- mained accommodative over the intermeeting period, with municipal bond yields edging down to record lows. Issuance of municipal bonds was solid in the case of higher-rated bonds, while it was still below pre-pan- demic levels for speculative-grade and unrated securities. The credit quality of municipal debt appeared stable, al- though pandemic-related risks to state and local govern- ment finances remained. Financing conditions facing small businesses remained relatively tight, and their loan demand was generally weak. Although the July SLOOS banks reported, on net, easier lending standards for C&I loans to small firms over the second quarter, industry commentary suggested that the lending standards of community banks and of other lenders not included in the SLOOS remained rel- atively tight. Furthermore, the results of a separate sur- vey suggested that the share of firms that did not want to borrow remained near its all-time high. Meanwhile, loan performance for small businesses continued to im- prove, with delinquency rates continuing to decline in May. For commercial real estate (CRE) financed through cap- ital markets, financing conditions remained accommo- dative. Spreads of agency and non-agency commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) were generally at or below pre-pandemic levels. Issuance of agency CMBS remained robust and issuance of non-agency CMBS strengthened notably in June. Delinquency rates on mortgages in CMBS pools were little changed but con- tinued to be elevated on hotel and retail mortgages. Meanwhile, bank-based financing conditions for CRE remained relatively tight. CRE loan growth at banks re- mained weak in the second quarter in comparison with pre-pandemic levels. In the July SLOOS, banks re- ported that, despite some easing over the second quar- ter, the levels of CRE lending standards were still tight relative to the midpoint of the range of standards that had prevailed since 2005. Financing conditions in the residential real estate market remained accommodative. This was particularly true for stronger borrowers who met standard conforming loan criteria. In addition, according to the July SLOOS, bank lending standards for jumbo loans eased over the second quarter to near their pre-pandemic levels. However, al- though broad financing conditions for lower-score Fed- eral Housing Administration borrowers also continued to ease, their credit standards remained tighter than be- fore the pandemic. Mortgage rates ticked down over the intermeeting period, in line with rates on MBS and 10-year Treasury securities. Furthermore, the spread of mortgage rates to MBS yields was close to pre-pandemic levels after having widened significantly at the start of Page 8 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ the pandemic. Mortgage originations for home pur- chases and refinancing were fairly robust through June. Financing conditions for consumer credit remained ac- commodative. Consumer credit jumped in May and re- mained strong in June, reflecting a rebound in credit card balances and continued robust growth in auto loans. Banks in the July SLOOS reported stronger demand and easier standards for both credit cards and auto loans over the second quarter. The staff provided an update on its assessments of the stability of the financial system and, on balance, charac- terized the financial vulnerabilities of the U.S. financial system as notable. The staff judged that asset valuation pressures were elevated. In particular, the forward price- to-earnings ratio for the S&P 500 index stood at the up- per end of its historical distribution; high-yield corporate bond spreads tightened further and were near the low end of their historical range; and house prices continued to increase rapidly, leaving valuation measures stretched. That said, the staff did not see signs of loose mortgage underwriting standards or excessive credit growth that could potentially amplify a shock arising from falling house prices. The staff assessed vulnerabilities associ- ated with nonfinancial leverage as lower than in January but still notable. For households, the mortgage debt-to- income ratio was moderate, and mortgage borrowing was concentrated among prime borrowers, though some uncertainty remained regarding the outlook for mort- gages in non-payment status. While measures of corpo- rate-sector leverage fell since January, particularly at the most levered firms, the debt of firms that had relatively low earnings-to-interest payment ratios remained high. The staff judged that vulnerabilities arising from finan- cial leverage were moderate. The aggregate common eq- uity tier 1 capital ratio of the largest banks significantly exceeded regulatory requirements. However, some available measures of hedge fund leverage were elevated, and significant data gaps continued to obscure risks at hedge funds and other nonbank financial institutions. Vulnerabilities associated with funding risks were char- acterized as moderate. Domestic banks held significant quantities of high-quality liquid assets and had only lim- ited reliance on short-term wholesale funding. None- theless, significant structural vulnerabilities remained at entities such as prime money funds, and new financial arrangements such as stablecoins appeared to have the same structural maturity and liquidity transformation vulnerabilities but with less transparency and an under- developed regulatory framework. Staff Economic Outlook The projection for U.S. economic activity prepared by the staff for the July FOMC meeting was little changed, on balance, from the June forecast. In the second half of 2021, an easing of the surge in demand seen over the first part of the year was expected to be largely offset by a reduction in the effects of supply constraints on pro- duction, thereby allowing real GDP growth to continue at a rapid pace. For the year as a whole, therefore, real GDP was projected to post a substantial increase, with a correspondingly large decline in the unemployment rate. With the boost to spending growth from continued re- ductions in social distancing assumed to fade after 2021 and with a further unwinding of the effects of fiscal stim- ulus, GDP growth was expected to step down in 2022 and 2023. However, with monetary policy assumed to remain highly accommodative, the staff continued to an- ticipate that real GDP growth would outpace growth in potential output over most of this period, leading to a decline in the unemployment rate to historically low lev- els. The staff’s near-term outlook for inflation was revised up further in response to incoming data, but the staff continued to expect that this year’s rise in inflation would prove to be transitory. The 12-month change in total and core PCE prices was well above 2 percent in May, and available data suggested that PCE price infla- tion would remain high in June. The staff continued to judge that the surge in demand that had resulted as the economy reopened further had combined with produc- tion bottlenecks and supply constraints to boost recent monthly inflation rates. The staff expected the 12-month change in PCE prices to move down gradually over the second part of 2021, reflecting an anticipated moderation in monthly inflation rates and the waning of base effects; even so, PCE price inflation was projected to be running well above 2 percent at the end of the year. Over the following year, the boost to consumer prices caused by supply issues was expected to partly reverse, and import prices were expected to decelerate sharply; as a result, PCE price inflation was expected to step down to a little below 2 percent in 2022 before addi- tional increases in resource utilization raised it to 2 per- cent in 2023. The staff continued to judge that the risks to the baseline projection for economic activity were skewed to the downside and that the uncertainty around the forecast was elevated. In particular, the probability that the course of the pandemic would turn out to be more ad- verse than the staff’s baseline assumption was viewed to _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Minutes of the Meeting of July 27–28, 2021 Page 9 be higher than the probability that a more favorable out- come would occur. However, the staff judged that the risks around the inflation projection were now tilted to the upside, as recent data pointed to a greater risk that the upward pressure on inflation that had resulted from supply-related issues would unwind more slowly than the staff’s baseline projection assumed. Participants’ Views on Current Economic Condi- tions and the Economic Outlook In their discussion of current conditions, participants noted that, with progress on vaccinations and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and em- ployment had continued to strengthen. The sectors most adversely affected by the pandemic had shown im- provement but had not fully recovered. Inflation had risen, largely reflecting transitory factors. Overall finan- cial conditions remained accommodative, in part reflect- ing policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses. Par- ticipants noted that the path of the economy would con- tinue to depend on the course of the virus. Progress on vaccinations would likely continue to reduce the effects of the public health crisis on the economy, but risks to the economic outlook remained. Participants observed that economic activity continued to expand at a rapid pace through the middle of the year even though capacity constraints were restraining the in- crease in output in some sectors. Economic growth was expected to remain strong over the second half of the year, supported by the further reopening of the econ- omy, accommodative financial conditions, and easing of supply constraints. Nevertheless, participants generally saw supply disruptions and labor shortages as likely to persist over the second half of the year. In their discussion of the household sector, participants remarked that consumer spending had continued to in- crease at a very rapid pace, supported by the ongoing reopening of the economy along with the accommoda- tion provided by fiscal policy and monetary policy. In addition, the accumulated stock of savings and further progress on vaccination were cited as important factors lifting household spending. Some participants noted that they expected consumer spending to continue to be bolstered by these factors. Participants generally ex- pected housing demand to remain strong but noted that construction had been restrained by shortages of mate- rials and other inputs and that home sales had been held back by limited supplies of available homes. With respect to the business sector, participants ob- served that activity in the service industries most ad- versely affected by the pandemic, such as in the leisure and hospitality sector, was rebounding as the economy reopened further but had not fully recovered. Partici- pants noted that growth in manufacturing activity con- tinued to be solid but was restrained by production bot- tlenecks and supply constraints, particularly in the motor vehicle sector. Citing reports received from contacts in a broad range of industries, participants indicated that shortages of materials and labor as well as supply chain challenges remained widespread and continued to limit the ability of firms to keep up with strong demand. Even though their outlook for demand had improved further, many business contacts had expressed uncertainty and pessimism over prospects regarding the easing of supply constraints over the near term. Participants commented on the continued improvement in labor market conditions in recent months driven by strong demand for workers. The monthly pace of job gains had picked up, with employment expanding 850,000 in June and with notable increases in the leisure and hospitality sector. Nevertheless, the household sur- vey showed that the unemployment rate remained ele- vated at 5.9 percent in June, and the labor force partici- pation rate and employment-to-population ratio were lit- tle changed in recent months. Participants indicated that the economy had not yet achieved the Committee’s broad-based and inclusive maximum-employment goal. Several participants remarked that the labor market re- covery continued to be uneven across demographic and income groups and across sectors. Participants generally noted that supply-side factors related to the pandemic— such as caregiving needs, ongoing fears of the virus, in- creased retirements, and expanded unemployment in- surance payments—continued to weigh on labor force participation and employment growth. A majority of participants anticipated that most of these factors would ease in the coming months. They also noted, however, that the spread of the Delta variant may temporarily de- lay the full reopening of the economy and restrain hiring and labor supply. Participants observed that recent wage increases had been moderate on average. However, District contacts had continued to report having trouble hiring workers and had indicated that this difficulty was putting upward pressure on wages in some sectors or leading employers to provide additional incentives to attract and retain workers. Several participants noted that their District contacts expected that difficulties finding workers would likely extend into the fall. Page 10 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ In their discussion of inflation, participants observed that the inflation rate had increased notably and ex- pected that it would likely remain elevated in coming months before moderating. Participants remarked that inflation had increased generally more than expected this year and attributed this increase to supply constraints in product and labor markets and a surge in consumer de- mand as the economy reopened. They noted that many of their District contacts had reported that higher input costs were also putting upward pressure on prices. Many participants pointed out that the largest contributors to recent increases in measures of inflation were a handful of sectors most affected by temporary supply bottle- necks or sectors in which price levels were rebounding from depressed levels as the economy continued to reo- pen. Looking ahead, while participants generally ex- pected inflation pressures to ease as the effect of these transitory factors dissipated, several participants re- marked that larger-than-anticipated supply chain disrup- tions and increases in input costs could sustain upward pressure on prices into 2022. In their comments on in- flation expectations, some participants noted that measures of longer-term inflation expectations had re- mained in ranges that were viewed as broadly consistent with the Committee’s longer-run inflation goal. Several participants indicated that the recent increases in survey- based measures signaled a risk that longer-term inflation expectations might be moving up above levels consistent with the Committee’s goals. Other participants pointed to the substantial decline in TIPS-based longer-term in- flation compensation since June as suggesting that inves- tors perceived reduced risks that inflation could run per- sistently above the Committee’s 2 percent goal. A cou- ple of participants noted that recent readings on forward inflation compensation could be read as suggesting in- vestor concern that inflation over the longer term could run persistently below the Committee’s 2 percent infla- tion goal. In discussing the uncertainty and risks associated with the economic outlook, many participants remarked that uncertainty was quite high, with slowing in progress on vaccinations and developments surrounding the Delta variant posing downside risks to the economic outlook. A number of participants judged that the effects of sup- ply chain disruptions and labor shortages would likely complicate the task of interpreting the incoming data and assessing the speed at which these supply-side fac- tors would dissipate. Some participants noted that there were upside risks to inflation associated with concerns that supply disruptions and labor shortages might linger for longer than currently anticipated and might have larger or more persistent effects on prices and wages than they currently assumed. Participants who commented on financial stability em- phasized the risks associated with elevated valuations across many asset classes. A few participants highlighted scenarios in which a prolonged period of low interest rates and broadly elevated asset valuations could gener- ate imbalances, which could increase financial stability risks. Some participants commented on the housing market and noted that ongoing rapid house price in- creases reflected both demand and supply factors. Sev- eral participants noted that the lack of evidence of dete- riorating mortgage underwriting standards could miti- gate risks associated with high housing valuations; a cou- ple of other participants, however, expressed concern that a home price reversal could pose risks to financial stability. Some participants cited various potential risks to financial stability including the risks associated with expanded use of cryptocurrencies or the risks associated with collateral liquidity at central counterparties during episodes of market stress. In connection with the for- mer set of risks, a few of these participants highlighted the fragility and the general lack of transparency associ- ated with stablecoins, the importance of monitoring them closely, and the need to develop an appropriate regulatory framework to address any risks to financial stability associated with such products. In their consideration of the stance of monetary policy, participants reaffirmed the Federal Reserve’s commit- ment to using its full range of tools to support the U.S. economy during this challenging time, thereby pro- moting the Committee’s statutory goals of maximum employment and price stability. Participants judged that the current stance of monetary policy remained appro- priate to promote maximum employment as well as to achieve inflation that averages 2 percent over time and longer-term inflation expectations that are well anchored at 2 percent. Participants also reiterated that the existing outcome-based guidance implied that the paths of the federal funds rate and the balance sheet would depend on actual progress toward reaching the Committee’s maximum-employment and inflation goals. Participants discussed the progress toward the Commit- tee’s goals since December 2020, when the Committee adopted its guidance for asset purchases. They generally judged that the Committee’s standard of “substantial further progress” toward the maximum-employment and inflation goals had not yet been met, particularly with respect to labor market conditions, and that risks to _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Minutes of the Meeting of July 27–28, 2021 Page 11 the economic outlook remained. Most participants an- ticipated that the economy would continue to make pro- gress toward those goals and, provided that the economy evolved broadly as they anticipated, they judged that the standard set out in the Committee’s guidance regarding asset purchases could be reached this year. With regard to the labor market, participants noted that the demand for workers had been strong in recent months, while the level of employment had been constrained by labor sup- ply shortages and hiring difficulties. Several participants emphasized that employment remained well below its pre-pandemic level and that a robust labor market, sup- ported by a continuation of accommodative monetary policy, would allow further progress toward the Com- mittee’s broad and inclusive maximum-employment goal and a return over time to labor market conditions as strong as those prevailing before the pandemic. A few other participants judged that monetary policy had lim- ited ability to address the labor supply shortages and hir- ing difficulties currently constraining the level of em- ployment. Several participants also commented that the pandemic might have caused longer-lasting changes in the labor market and that the pre-pandemic labor market conditions may not be the right benchmark against which the Committee should assess the progress toward its maximum-employment objective. With regard to inflation, participants commented that re- cent inflation readings had been boosted by the effects of supply bottlenecks and labor shortages and were likely to be transitory. A few participants noted that, while the specific results depended on the period used in the cal- culation, some measures of average inflation were al- ready moving above, or would soon move above, the Committee’s 2 percent goal, supported by strong de- mand, a tight labor market, and firming inflation expec- tations. Some other participants emphasized that recent high inflation readings had largely been driven by price increases in a handful of categories. These participants pointed out that there was no evidence of broad-based price pressures or of inappropriately high longer-term inflation expectations. Several participants also com- mented that price increases concentrated in a small num- ber of categories were unlikely to change underlying in- flation dynamics sufficiently to overcome the possibility of a persistent downward bias in inflation, as might be associated with the effective lower bound on the policy rate. Many participants remarked upon risk-management considerations when contemplating how and when to make changes to the Committee’s pace of asset pur- chases. Some participants suggested that it would be prudent for the Committee to prepare for starting to re- duce its pace of asset purchases relatively soon, in light of the risk that the recent high inflation readings could prove to be more persistent than they had anticipated and because an earlier start to reducing asset purchases would most likely enable additions to securities holdings to be concluded before the Committee judged it appro- priate to raise the federal funds rate. A few participants expressed concerns that maintaining highly accommo- dative financial conditions might contribute to a further buildup in risk to the financial system that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s dual-mandate goals. In contrast, a few other participants suggested that prep- arations for reducing the pace of asset purchases should encompass the possibility that the reductions might not occur for some time and highlighted the risks that rising COVID-19 cases associated with the spread of the Delta variant could cause delays in returning to work and school and so damp the economic recovery. Several par- ticipants also remained concerned about the medium- term outlook for inflation and the possibility of the reemergence of significant downward pressure on infla- tion, especially in light of the recent decline in longer- term inflation compensation. In addition, several partic- ipants emphasized that there was considerable uncer- tainty about the likely resolution of the labor market shortages and supply bottlenecks and about the influ- ence of pandemic-related developments on longer-run labor market and inflation dynamics. Those participants stressed that the Committee should be patient in as- sessing progress toward its goals and in announcing changes to its plans on asset purchases. Some participants emphasized that a decision to reduce the Committee’s pace of asset purchases once the “sub- stantial further progress” benchmark had been achieved would be fully consistent with the Committee’s new monetary policy framework and would help foster the achievement of the Committee’s longer-run objectives over time. A couple of participants also noted that a ta- pering of asset purchases did not amount to a tightening of the stance of monetary policy and instead only im- plied that additional monetary accommodation would be provided at a slower rate. Several participants empha- sized that an announcement of a reduction in the Com- mittee’s pace of asset purchases should not be inter- preted as the beginning of a predetermined course for raising the federal funds rate from its current level. Those participants stressed that the Committee’s assess- ment regarding the appropriate timing of an increase in the target range for the federal funds rate was separate from its current deliberations on asset purchases and Page 12 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ would be subject to the higher standard, as laid out in the Committee’s outcome-based guidance on the federal funds rate. Nonetheless, a couple of participants cau- tioned that it could be challenging for the public to dis- entangle deliberations about the two tools and that any decisions the Committee made on its asset purchases would likely influence the public’s understanding of the Committee’s other policy intentions, including with re- gard to future decisions concerning the target range for the federal funds rate. Committee Policy Action In their discussion of monetary policy for this meeting, members agreed that with progress on vaccinations and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment had continued to strengthen. They noted that the sectors most adversely affected by the pandemic had shown improvement but had not fully re- covered. Inflation had risen, largely reflecting transitory factors. Overall financial conditions remained accom- modative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses. Members also acknowledged that the path of the economy continued to depend on the course of the virus. Progress on vaccinations would likely con- tinue to reduce the effects of the public health crisis on the economy, but risks to the economic outlook re- mained. Members agreed that the Federal Reserve was commit- ted to using its full range of tools to support the U.S. economy in this challenging time, thereby promoting its maximum-employment and price-stability goals. All members reaffirmed that, in accordance with the Com- mittee’s goals to achieve maximum employment and in- flation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run and with inflation having run persistently below this longer- run goal, they would aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and longer-term inflation expecta- tions remain well anchored at 2 percent. Members ex- pected to maintain an accommodative stance of mone- tary policy until those outcomes were achieved. All members agreed to keep the target range for the fed- eral funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent, and they expected that it would be appropriate to maintain this target range un- til labor market conditions had reached levels consistent with the Committee’s assessments of maximum employ- ment and inflation had risen to 2 percent and was on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time. Last December, the Committee indicated that it would continue to increase its holdings of Treasury securities by at least $80 billion per month and agency mortgage- backed securities by at least $40 billion per month until substantial further progress had been made toward its maximum-employment and price-stability goals. The members commented that, since then, the economy had made progress toward these goals, and they agreed to continue to assess progress in coming meetings. They judged that these asset purchases would help foster smooth market functioning and accommodative finan- cial conditions, thereby supporting the flow of credit to households and businesses. Members agreed that, in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, they would continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and that they would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate in the event that risks emerged that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals. Members also concurred that, in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, they would take into account a wide range of information, in- cluding readings on public health, labor market condi- tions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments. Members agreed that the postmeeting statement should acknowledge the economy’s continued recovery as well as its progress toward the Committee’s maximum-em- ployment and price-stability goals set forth in the Com- mittee’s asset purchase guidance in December. In light of these developments, members decided to remove the characterization of sectors most adversely affected by the pandemic as being in a “weak” condition and to re- place it with the judgment that those sectors “have not fully recovered.” They also agreed to remove the word “significantly” when characterizing the dependence of the path of the economy on the course of the virus. In addition, members agreed to insert the assessment that “the economy has made progress” toward the Commit- tee’s longer-run goals since the guidance on asset pur- chases was first issued in December and to indicate that the assessment of progress would continue in coming meetings. Members agreed that the addition of this lan- guage was appropriate to acknowledge the Committee’s ongoing deliberations in assessing the economy’s pro- gress toward the Committee’s goals and the implications for the pace of asset purchases. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the fol- lowing domestic policy directive, for release at 2:00 p.m.: _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Minutes of the Meeting of July 27–28, 2021 Page 13 “Effective July 29, 2021, the Federal Open Mar- ket Committee directs the Desk to: • Undertake open market operations as nec- essary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of 0 to ¼ percent. • Increase the System Open Market Ac- count holdings of Treasury securities by $80 billion per month and of agency mort- gage-backed securities (MBS) by $40 bil- lion per month. • Increase holdings of Treasury securities and agency MBS by additional amounts and purchase agency commercial mort- gage-backed securities (CMBS) as needed to sustain smooth functioning of markets for these securities. • Conduct overnight repurchase agreement operations with a minimum bid rate of 0.25 percent and with an aggregate opera- tion limit of $500 billion; the aggregate op- eration limit can be temporarily increased at the discretion of the Chair. • Conduct overnight reverse repurchase agreement operations at an offering rate of 0.05 percent and with a per-counterparty limit of $80 billion per day; the per- counterparty limit can be temporarily in- creased at the discretion of the Chair. • Roll over at auction all principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of Treasury securities and reinvest all princi- pal payments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of agency debt and agency MBS in agency MBS. • Allow modest deviations from stated amounts for purchases and reinvestments, if needed for operational reasons. • Engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settle- ment of the Federal Reserve’s agency MBS transactions.” The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below for release at 2:00 p.m.: “The Federal Reserve is committed to using its full range of tools to support the U.S. economy in this challenging time, thereby promoting its maximum employment and price stability goals. With progress on vaccinations and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment have continued to strengthen.

Overall financial conditions remain accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses. The path of the economy continues to depend on the course of the virus. Progress on vaccina- tions will likely continue to reduce the effects of the public health crisis on the economy, but risks to the economic outlook remain. The Committee seeks to achieve maximum em- ployment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. With inflation having run persistently below this longer-run goal, the Committee will aim to achieve inflation moder- ately above 2 percent for some time so that in- flation averages 2 percent over time and longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent. The Committee expects to maintain an accommodative stance of mone- tary policy until these outcomes are achieved. The Committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and expects it will be appropriate to maintain this target range until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee’s assessments of maximum employment and in- flation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time. Last December, the Committee indicated that it would continue to increase its holdings of Treasury securities by at least $80 billion per month and of agency mortgage-backed securi- ties by at least $40 billion per month until sub- stantial further progress has been made toward its maximum employment and price stability goals. Since then, the economy has made pro- gress toward these goals, and the Committee will continue to assess progress in coming meet- ings. These asset purchases help foster smooth market functioning and accommodative finan- cial conditions, thereby supporting the flow of credit to households and businesses. In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor Page 14 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals. The Committee’s assessments will take into account a wide range of information, in- cluding readings on public health, labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation ex- pectations, and financial and international de- velopments.” Voting for this action: Jerome H. Powell, John C. Williams, Thomas I. Barkin, Raphael W. Bostic, Michelle W. Bowman, Lael Brainard, Richard H. Clarida, Mary C. Daly, Charles L. Evans, Randal K. Quarles, and Christopher J. Waller. Voting against this action: None. Consistent with the Committee’s decision to leave the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged, the Board voted unanimously to establish the interest rate paid on reserve balances at 0.15 percent, effective July 29, 2021.5 The Board also voted unanimously to approve establishment of the primary credit rate at the existing level of 0.25 percent, effective July 29, 2021. It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Tuesday–Wednesday, September 21– 22, 2021. The meeting adjourned at 10:35 a.m. on July 28, 2021. Notation Vote By notation vote completed on July 6, 2021, the Com- mittee unanimously approved the minutes of the Com- mittee meeting held on June 15–16, 2021. _______________________ James A. Clouse Secretary 5 As announced on June 2, 2021, the Board approved a final rule, effective July 29, amending Regulation D to eliminate ref- erences to an interest on required reserves (IORR) rate and to an interest on excess reserves (IOER) rate and replace them with a single interest on reserve balances (IORB) rate. There- fore, the Board voted on one rate, the IORB rate, at this meet- ing and will continue to do so going forward.

Keshav Dogra, Senior Economist, Federal Reserve Bank of New York Developments in Financial Markets and Open Market Operations The manager turned first to a discussion of financial market developments over the period. Domestic finan- cial conditions were little changed, on net, and remained highly accommodative. The spread of the Delta variant of the COVID-19 virus weighed on the near-term growth outlook and median respondents to the Open Market Desk’s Survey of Primary Dealers marked down projections for gross domestic product (GDP) growth and revised up projections for inflation this year. None- theless, expectations for the trajectory of growth beyond 2021 were little changed. Implied forward inflation compensation two to four years ahead based on Treas- ury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) increased mod- estly over the intermeeting period. Regarding the outlook for monetary policy, market par- ticipants noted policymaker communications suggesting that tapering of asset purchases could begin this year and end by mid-2022. Around half of respondents to the Desk’s surveys of primary dealers and market partici- pants viewed December as the most likely timing of the first reduction in the net pace of purchases, although re- spondents also attached significant probability to the first reduction coming in November. Median expecta- tions for the pace of net purchases were consistent with a gradual tapering of net purchases being completed in July of next year, about one to two months earlier than in the previous surveys. Expectations for the target fed- eral funds rate based on survey responses and interest rate futures moved up slightly since the previous meet- ing. Several central banks announced reductions in the pace of their asset purchase programs or eventual plans for their balance sheets once asset purchases had been com- pleted. These announcements were broadly in line with market participants’ expectations and elicited only a modest reaction in financial markets. In Latin America and emerging Europe, some central banks recently tight- ened policy to address rising inflation pressures. Inves- tors remained focused on other vulnerabilities in emerg- ing markets, and concerns had grown recently about the possible implications of developments in China. The manager turned next to a discussion of money mar- kets and Federal Reserve operations. Domestic funding 4 Attended the discussion of economic developments and the outlook. Page 2 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ conditions were stable over the period. The federal funds rate edged lower amid ongoing increases in re- serves, but it remained well within the target range; the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) was steady at 5 basis points. Participation in the overnight reverse re- purchase agreement (ON RRP) facility increased to an average of just over $1 trillion over the period, driven primarily by increased usage by government money mar- ket funds. Market participants were attentive over the period to negotiations on the debt limit. Yields on Treasury bills maturing in mid-October to mid-Novem- ber had become modestly elevated as investors reduced exposures to securities that could be at risk for delayed payments. Market participants noted information in the public domain about measures the Federal Reserve and the Treasury could take around a debt limit event. They pointed, in particular, to the October 2013 FOMC meet- ing minutes, which highlighted that the Federal Reserve would use normal procedures in its operations, both as the debt limit nears and in the event of a delayed pay- ment. Market participants also focused on a 2013 report by the Treasury Market Practices Group (TMPG), which outlined a process that could be used to delay principal payments on Treasury securities by rolling forward the operational maturity date in order to maintain the ability to transfer such securities over Fedwire®. The TMPG report noted that such a procedure would help support ongoing functioning of markets for securities with de- layed payments. This would maintain their eligibility in open market operations under normal procedures. Nev- ertheless, market participants emphasized that, even with these procedures, a delayed payment would create severe and broad-based market disruption. In light of increased usage of the ON RRP facility and the potential for continued downward pressure on short-term interest rates over the near term, the manager next discussed a staff proposal to increase the per- counterparty limit for the ON RRP facility to $160 bil- lion. Staff analysis suggested that the proposed increase was likely to be sufficient to support effective policy im- plementation for most foreseeable circumstances. The manager provided a brief update on the new repur- chase agreement (repo) facilities that the Committee had announced following its meeting in July. The Desk had been working to onboard depository institutions as ad- ditional counterparties for the standing repo facility. In addition, a number of foreign central banks had ex- pressed intent to establish access to the Foreign and In- ternational Monetary Authority Repo Facility. By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk’s domestic transactions over the intermeeting period. There were no intervention operations in foreign curren- cies for the System’s account during the intermeeting pe- riod. Staff Review of the Economic Situation The information available at the time of the Septem- ber 21–22 meeting suggested that U.S. real GDP was in- creasing in the third quarter at a slower pace than in the second quarter of the year. The pace of improvement in labor market conditions had remained very rapid in July but slowed sharply in August. Consumer price inflation in June and July—as measured by the 12-month percent- age change in the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index—was elevated. Total nonfarm payroll employment increased sharply in July but rose much less rapidly in August, with job gains in the leisure and hospitality sector slowing to zero. In addition, state and local government employment was reported to have fallen in August, though abnormal sea- sonal swings had likely distorted recent readings for this sector. As of August, total payroll employment had re- traced three-fourths of the losses seen at the onset of the pandemic. The unemployment rate had declined from 5.9 percent in June to 5.2 percent in August; although the unemployment rates for African Americans and His- panics had also declined, on net, over this period, both rates remained well above the national average. The la- bor force participation rate edged up, on net, and the employment-to-population (EPOP) ratio rose further in July and August. Private-sector job openings, as meas- ured by the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, increased further in July and continued to suggest that labor demand was extraordinarily high. Initial claims for regular state unemployment insurance remained near the pandemic-period low that had been reached in early Sep- tember but were still somewhat elevated relative to pre- pandemic levels. Weekly estimates of private-sector pay- rolls constructed by the Board’s staff using data pro- vided by the payroll processor ADP that were available through early September pointed to a modest pickup in the pace of private employment gains relative to August. Average hourly earnings for all employees rose strongly in July and August, with gains that were widespread across industries. Recent monthly increases in average hourly earnings appeared to reflect a combination of continued strong labor demand and increased difficul- ties in hiring. A staff measure of the 12-month change in the median wage derived from the ADP data had also pointed to strong wage growth, with a pace in August Minutes of the Meeting of September 21–22, 2021 Page 3 _____________________________________________________________________________________________ that was well above the growth rates seen before the pandemic. By contrast, the Wage Growth Tracker meas- ure constructed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta had not shown a similar pickup. The employment cost index of hourly compensation in the private sector, which also includes benefit costs, rose at an annual rate of 3.6 percent over the 6 months ending in June, 1 per- centage point faster than the 12-month change posted in December 2020. Inflation, as measured by either the PCE price index or the consumer price index (CPI), had been boosted by a surge in demand as the economy reopened further, along with the effects of production bottlenecks and supply constraints. Total PCE price inflation was 4.2 percent over the 12 months ending in July, and core PCE price inflation, which excludes changes in consumer energy prices and many consumer food prices, was 3.6 percent over the 12 months ending in July. In contrast, the trimmed mean measure of 12-month PCE inflation con- structed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas was 2.0 percent in July. In August, the 12-month change in the CPI was 5.3 percent, while the core CPI rose 4.0 per- cent over the same period. In the third quarter of 2021, the staff’s common inflation expectations index, which combines information from many indicators of inflation expectations and inflation compensation, was little changed relative to the second quarter and was near its average over the decade before the pandemic. Although real PCE declined in July, the components of retail sales used to estimate PCE rose strongly in August, returning to levels seen in the spring. However, con- cerns about the course of the pandemic appeared to be weighing on consumer services spending, as available in- dicators pointed to a slowing in demand for services sen- sitive to social distancing. In addition, measures of con- sumer confidence had moved lower in August. Demand for housing appeared to have remained very strong, but incoming data suggested that materials shortages and a lack of developed lots for construction were restraining residential building activity. Available indicators suggested that growth in business fixed investment was slowing somewhat in the third quarter as supply bottlenecks—particularly for motor vehicles—weighed on business equipment spending. Manufacturing output rose strongly in July and ticked up further in August. In August, activity in the oil and gas sector and production of petrochemicals had been held down by shutdowns related to Hurricane Ida. Supply chain issues faced by a number of other industries also continued to be a drag on overall factory output. Total real government purchases appeared to be increas- ing in the third quarter after having moved lower in the second quarter. Available data suggested that federal nondefense purchases were declining sharply in the third quarter but that robust gains in real state and local pur- chases were offsetting this decline. The U.S. international trade deficit remained high in July. After rising in June, real goods imports fell back in July, held down by a sizable decline in consumer goods imports, but the levels of consumer and total goods im- ports remained well above pre-COVID-19 levels. Real goods exports edged up in July and were close to pre- pandemic levels. Bottlenecks in the global semiconduc- tor industry continued to weigh on exports and imports of automotive products, and shipping congestion con- tinued to restrain trade overall. Exports and imports of services rose again in July, but they remained low relative to pre-pandemic levels, largely because international travel was still depressed. In the advanced foreign economies (AFEs), where high vaccination rates had increased resilience to COVID-19 outbreaks, incoming data were consistent with economic growth in the third quarter at a slightly faster pace than in the second quarter. With the economic reopening un- der way, purchasing managers indexes for both manu- facturing and services remained strong in Europe and Canada. Conversely, in emerging market economies (EMEs)—especially in Southeast Asia, where vaccina- tion rates were lower—a global resurgence in COVID- 19 infections due to the Delta variant led to renewals of public health restrictions. These restrictions weakened retail sales and contributed to labor shortages and trans- portation congestion, disrupting global supply chains. Inflation abroad was elevated, reflecting reversals of price declines early in the pandemic, past increases in en- ergy and commodity prices, upward pressures from sup- ply bottlenecks, and past exchange rate depreciations in some EMEs. Staff Review of the Financial Situation Financial market prices were little changed over the in- termeeting period. Concerns over the period about the effects of COVID-19 developments on economic per- formance and, late in the period, about a heavily in- debted Chinese property developer appeared to have only marginal net effects on financial asset prices. The incoming domestic economic data were generally viewed as mixed. Yields on Treasury securities of intermediate maturities increased modestly, the market-implied path of the federal funds rate steepened, domestic equity prices were unchanged, and speculative-grade corporate Page 4 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ bond spreads narrowed modestly. Short-term funding markets were stable. Market-based financing conditions were robust, and credit availability improved for riskier borrowers. Yields on intermediate-maturity Treasury securities in- creased modestly, on net, amid mixed news on economic activity and the pandemic, and slightly less-accommoda- tive-than-expected July FOMC communications. Measures of inflation compensation declined modestly, on net. The market-implied level of the effective federal funds rate for the ends of 2023 and 2024 rose 12 and 17 basis points, respectively. Broad stock market prices were about unchanged, on net, over the intermeeting period. Early in the period, concerns over the Delta variant were a headwind for stock prices. Prices recovered following the FDA’s first full approval of a COVID-19 vaccine and signs that the Delta variant surge was starting to abate. Over the in- termeeting period, spreads of yields on speculative-grade corporate bonds over those on comparable-maturity Treasury securities narrowed slightly, on net. Invest- ment-grade corporate bond spreads were little changed, on net, and spreads of municipal bond indexes increased slightly but remained well below pre-pandemic levels. On September 20, stock market prices fell notably and speculative-grade yield spreads widened amid rising con- cerns about the creditworthiness of a Chinese property developer, but these moves were mostly reversed during the following day, particularly in the stock market. Short-term funding markets were stable over the inter- meeting period. The effective federal funds rate de- clined slightly, from 10 basis points at the beginning of the period to 8 basis points at the end, while the SOFR remained at 5 basis points throughout the period. Assets under management (AUM) of government money mar- ket mutual funds increased modestly to near all-time highs. Treasury bill supply continued to decline with the reinstatement of the debt ceiling. Higher AUM together with declining Treasury bill supply led government money market mutual funds to increase their participa- tion at the Federal Reserve’s ON RRP facility. Partici- pation in ON RRP operations increased from an average of $808 billion over the previous intermeeting period to $1.08 trillion. Foreign asset prices fluctuated moderately over the in- termeeting period as market participants continued to assess the effect of the Delta variant on global growth and inflation. Concerns about a potential default by a heavily indebted Chinese property developer and risks of a downturn in the Chinese real estate sector intensi- fied later in the period, but effects on broader financial markets were limited. On balance, major foreign equity indexes were mixed, the broad dollar appreciated a touch, and sovereign yields in most major AFEs in- creased moderately. In the euro area and the United Kingdom, higher-than-expected inflation data contrib- uted to the rise in yields and inflation compensation measures. In domestic credit markets, large nonfinancial firms had ample access to market-based financing as market par- ticipants appeared confident in the domestic corporate credit outlook. After accounting for the seasonal sum- mer lull in activity, gross corporate bond issuance re- mained solid in July and August. Leveraged loan issu- ance was also strong in July and August. Equity funding raised through traditional initial public offerings re- mained robust over the summer, while equity issuance through special purpose acquisition companies re- mained at the subdued levels seen in recent months. Commercial and industrial (C&I) loans declined notably through August, amid ongoing forgiveness of Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans. Excluding PPP loans, C&I loan balances were estimated to have been largely unchanged between June and July. The credit quality of large nonfinancial corporations re- mained strong with a positive outlook. The volume of credit rating upgrades for nonfinancial bonds outpaced downgrades noticeably in July and August. Trailing de- fault rates on corporate bonds and leveraged loans re- mained low, as did market indicators of future default expectations. In the municipal bond market, financing conditions re- mained accommodative. Issuance of municipal debt was strong in July and August and indicators of credit quality of municipal debt remained healthy, though municipal bond impairments—that is, credit events that are less se- vere than payment defaults—remained elevated in Au- gust. These impairments were concentrated in the re- tirement and assisted living sector and represent a very small fraction of the municipal market. Survey-based indicators suggest small business owners, especially from COVID-sensitive sectors that include lodging and food services, arts, entertainment and recre- ation, and educational services, became more pessimistic about their financial prospects, largely because of a worsening of near-term expectations for sales and gen- eral business conditions. Small business loan origina- tions were above pre-pandemic levels in June and July, Minutes of the Meeting of September 21–22, 2021 Page 5 _____________________________________________________________________________________________ but increased concerns about the Delta variant de- pressed loan demand in August. Financing conditions in commercial real estate (CRE) improved over the intermeeting period amid increasing CRE property prices. CRE loan growth at banks strengthened and issuance of commercial mortgage- backed securities (CMBS) remained robust over the summer. Spreads of agency CMBS were generally at or below pre-pandemic levels. Strong investor appetite for CMBS was supported by falling delinquency rates on mortgages, although delinquency rates remained ele- vated for CMBS backed by hotel and retail properties. Financing remained limited for the hard-hit hotel sector. In the residential mortgage market, financing conditions remained accommodative particularly for borrowers who met standard conforming loan criteria. Mortgage rates increased slightly over the intermeeting period but remained very low by historical standards. Credit avail- ability continued to improve, especially for jumbo loans and lower-score Federal Housing Administration bor- rowers. Indicators of mortgage originations for home- purchases and refinancing were solid through August. The share of mortgages in forbearance declined further in July and August. Financing conditions for consumer credit remained ac- commodative for most borrowers, especially those with stronger credit scores. Consumer credit and the credit card market expanded at a strong pace in June before stepping down somewhat in July. Conditions for nonprime consumers in the credit card market eased from tight levels. Auto loan growth slowed in June and July from its brisk pace in May. Conditions in the asset- backed securities market were robust over the intermeet- ing period. Staff Economic Outlook The projection for U.S. economic activity prepared by the staff for the September FOMC meeting was broadly similar to the July projection. In the second half of 2021, supply constraints were expected to resolve more slowly than previously assumed; in addition, the recent rise in COVID-19 cases was viewed as likely to exert a larger amount of restraint on consumer spending, hiring, and labor supply than previously anticipated. Even so, real GDP was expected to post a sizable gain over the second half of 2021 and over the year as a whole, resulting in a correspondingly large decline in the unemployment rate. In 2022, GDP was expected to rise more slowly than in 2021 but at a still-solid pace, supported by the continued reopening of the economy and an easing of supply con- straints. With the boost from these factors fading, real GDP growth was projected to step down noticeably in 2023 and to be roughly equal to potential output growth in 2023 and 2024. However, the level of real GDP was expected to remain well above potential throughout the projection period, resulting in a decline in the unemploy- ment rate to historically low levels. The staff’s near-term outlook for inflation was revised up further in response to incoming data, but the staff continued to expect that this year’s rise in inflation would prove to be transitory. The 12-month change in total and core PCE prices was well above 2 percent in July, and available data suggested that PCE price infla- tion had remained high in August. The staff interpreted recent inflation data as indicating that supply constraints were putting a larger amount of upward pressure on prices than previously anticipated; relative to the July projection, these supply constraints were also expected to take longer to resolve. As a result, the 12-month change in PCE prices was projected to hold roughly steady over the remainder of 2021 and to end the year well above 2 percent. Over the following year, the boost to consumer prices caused by supply issues was expected to partly reverse and import prices were expected to de- celerate sharply. PCE price inflation was therefore ex- pected to step down to a little below 2 percent in 2022; thereafter, additional increases in resource utilization were expected to cause it to gradually edge higher and to reach 2 percent in 2024. The staff continued to judge that the risks to the baseline projection for economic activity were skewed to the downside. In particular, the future course of the pan- demic was seen as an important source of downside risk. The staff also continued to judge that the risks around the inflation projection were tilted to the upside, with the possibility of more severe and persistent supply issues viewed as especially salient. In addition, the staff pointed to a risk that longer-run inflation expectations would move appreciably higher and lead to persistently elevated inflation. Participants’ Views on Current Economic Condi- tions and the Economic Outlook In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, participants submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and infla- tion for each year from 2021 through 2024 and over the longer run based on their individual assessments of ap- propriate monetary policy, including the path of the fed- eral funds rate. The longer-run projections represented each participant’s assessment of the rate to which each Page 6 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ variable would be expected to converge, over time, un- der appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy. A Summary of Eco- nomic Projections was released to the public following the conclusion of the meeting. In their discussion of current conditions, participants noted that, with progress on vaccinations and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and em- ployment had continued to strengthen. The sectors most adversely affected by the pandemic had improved in recent months, but the rise in COVID-19 cases had slowed their recovery. Inflation was elevated, largely re- flecting transitory factors. Overall financial conditions remained accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses. Participants noted that the path of the economy continued to depend on the course of the virus. Progress on vaccinations would likely continue to reduce the effects of the public health crisis on the economy, but risks to the economic outlook remained. Participants observed that economic activity had contin- ued to expand in recent months, though at a less rapid pace than in the first half of the year. They marked down their projections of real GDP growth for the year, point- ing to a reassessment of the severity and likely duration of supply constraints or of the effects of the spread of the Delta variant on the economy. Still, participants foresaw rapid growth this year, and several highlighted that the economy had shown resilience in the face of the recent wave of infections. In their discussion of the household sector, participants noted that consumer spending had decelerated in recent months after expanding at a very rapid pace in the first half of the year. The spread of the Delta variant was weighing on spending for some consumer services, and low inventories and high prices due to supply constraints were restraining spending on many goods, most notably motor vehicles. Nonetheless, participants expected the accumulated stock of savings, the release of pent-up de- mand, and progress on vaccinations to continue to sup- port household spending in coming months. Partici- pants noted that residential construction had been re- strained by shortages of materials and other inputs and that home sales had been held back by limited supplies of available homes. With respect to the business sector, participants ob- served that firms in a number of industries were facing challenges keeping up with strong demand due to wide- spread supply chain bottlenecks as well as labor short- ages. Some participants commented that the recent global wave of COVID-19 infections and associated business shutdowns were exacerbating or prolonging these problems. The supply chain bottlenecks were cre- ating challenges for a number of manufacturers; the problems were seen as especially acute for the motor ve- hicle industry, where the shortages of semiconductor chips had sharply curtailed production. Retail industries were also facing various bottlenecks, including those stemming from port congestion and delays in ground transportation. Participants noted that their District contacts generally did not expect these bottlenecks to be fully resolved until sometime next year or even later. A couple of participants noted that inventories-to-sales ra- tios were at or near record-low levels in many industries, and the need to rebuild them would boost business in- vestment going forward. Participants also discussed the developments in oil, gasoline, and agricultural sectors. A couple of participants pointed out that Hurricane Ida significantly affected the oil and gas industries, curtailing U.S. offshore production at a time of low inventories. A couple of other participants noted that elevated crop prices were continuing to boost income in the agricul- tural sector. Participants noted that labor market conditions had con- tinued to improve in recent months. The unemploy- ment rate declined further to 5.2 percent in August, and a few participants noted a further pickup in recent months in the level of activity indicator in the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City’s Labor Market Conditions Indicators. After a rapid pace of almost 1 million per month in June and July, job gains slowed to 235,000 in August as the resurgence of COVID-19 cases weighed on employment in high-contact service sectors, particu- larly in the leisure and hospitality sector. Meanwhile, the labor force participation rate was little changed, remain- ing at a lower level than its pre-pandemic values. Some participants noted that the increase in labor force partic- ipation that they had expected had not yet materialized in the wake of the reopening of schools and the expira- tion of the extended unemployment benefits, and that this likely reflected in part concerns about the resurgence of the virus, childcare challenges, and the uncertainties generated by ongoing disruptions to in-person school- ing. Participants expected the labor market to continue to improve in coming months. Several participants in- dicated that a rise in the labor force participation rate might lag the improvements in other indicators such as the unemployment rate—a pattern consistent with past business cycle recoveries. Participants expressed a range Minutes of the Meeting of September 21–22, 2021 Page 7 _____________________________________________________________________________________________ of views regarding the extent to which they expected the labor force participation rate and the EPOP ratio would move back to their pre-pandemic levels. Various partic- ipants suggested that a complete return to pre-pandemic conditions was unlikely, as the pandemic had prompted reductions in the workforce that were likely to persist, including a large number of retirements and other depar- tures from the labor force. A number of others, how- ever, assessed that once the COVID-related concerns that were currently weighing on labor force participation passed, the participation rate and the EPOP ratio could return to, or even exceed, the pre-pandemic levels. Some participants remarked that the labor market recov- ery continued to be uneven across demographic and in- come groups and across sectors, with the recovery being particularly slow for women with young children and people with lower incomes. Participants noted that their District contacts had broadly reported having difficulty hiring workers. The labor shortages were causing firms to reduce hours and scale back production while also leading employers to provide incentives to attract and retain workers, includ- ing wage increases and signing and retention bonuses. The rate of nominal wage growth had been robust in re- cent data; for example, average hourly earnings were up 4.9 percent at an annualized rate over the past six months. In their discussion of inflation, participants observed that the inflation rate was elevated, and they expected that it would likely remain so in coming months before moderating. Participants marked up their inflation pro- jections, as they assessed that supply constraints in prod- uct and labor markets were larger and likely to be longer lasting than previously anticipated. Some participants expressed concerns that elevated rates of inflation could feed through into longer-term inflation expectations of households and businesses or saw recent inflation data as suggestive of broader inflation pressures. Several other participants pointed out that the largest contribu- tors to the recent elevated measures of inflation were a handful of COVID-related, pandemic-sensitive catego- ries in which specific, identifiable bottlenecks were at play. This observation suggested that the upward pres- sure on prices would abate as the COVID-related de- mand and supply imbalances subsided. These partici- pants noted that prices in some of those categories showed signs of stabilizing or even turned down of late. Many participants pointed out that the owners’ equiva- lent rent component of price indexes should be moni- tored carefully, as rising home prices could lead to up- ward pressure on rents. A few participants noted that there was not yet evidence that robust wage growth was exerting upward pressure on prices to a significant de- gree, but also that the possibility merited close monitor- ing. In their comments on inflation expectations, several par- ticipants observed that measures of longer-term infla- tion expectations, including TIPS- and survey-based measures, had remained in ranges that were viewed as broadly consistent with the Committee’s longer-run in- flation goal, or that the distribution across households of longer-term expected inflation had remained stable over the past two years. Many participants noted the substantial rise in one- and three-year measures of infla- tion expectations in the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s Survey of Consumer Expectations or in the one- year measure in the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers. A few participants remarked that these sur- vey measures tended to be sensitive to movements in ac- tual inflation, or that the recent rise was consistent with previous historical relationships between such measures and actual inflation. In discussing the uncertainty and risks associated with the economic outlook, participants noted that uncer- tainty remained high. A number of participants judged that the uncertain course of the virus, supply chain dis- ruptions, and labor shortages complicated the task of in- terpreting incoming economic data and assessing pro- gress toward the Committee’s goals. Participants gener- ally saw the risks to the outlook for economic activity as broadly balanced. Uncertainty around the course of the virus, the resolution of supply constraints, and fiscal measures were cited as presenting both upside and downside risks. In addition, some participants men- tioned the risks associated with high asset valuations in the United States and abroad, and a number of partici- pants commented on the importance of resolving the is- sues involving the federal government budget and debt ceiling in a timely manner. Most participants saw infla- tion risks as weighted to the upside because of concerns that supply disruptions and labor shortages might last longer and might have larger or more persistent effects on prices and wages than they currently assumed. A few participants commented that there were also some downside risks for inflation, as the factors that had held inflation down over the previous long expansion were likely still in place. In their consideration of the stance of monetary policy, participants reaffirmed the Federal Reserve’s commit- ment to using its full range of tools to support the U.S. Page 8 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ economy during this challenging time, thereby promot- ing the Committee’s statutory goals of maximum em- ployment and price stability. Participants judged that the current stance of monetary policy remained appropriate to promote maximum employment as well as to achieve inflation that averages 2 percent over time and longer- term inflation expectations that are well anchored at 2 percent. Participants also reiterated that the existing outcome-based guidance implied that the paths of the federal funds rate and the balance sheet would depend on actual progress toward reaching the Committee’s maximum-employment and inflation goals. Participants resumed their discussions on the progress made toward the Committee’s goals since December 2020, when the Committee adopted its guidance regard- ing asset purchases and indicated that purchases would continue at their current pace until substantial further progress had been made toward the Committee’s goals of maximum employment and price stability. These pur- chases had been a critical part of the Federal Reserve’s efforts to foster smooth financial market functioning and accommodative financial conditions, thereby sup- porting the flow of credit to households and businesses as well as the economic recovery. Most participants re- marked that the standard of “substantial further pro- gress” had been met with regard to the Committee’s price-stability goal or that it was likely to be met soon. With regard to the Committee’s maximum-employment goal, participants considered the cumulative degree of improvement in the labor market since December 2020. In doing so, participants cited the progress recorded in a number of individual series, including, among others, the employment-to-population ratio, the unemployment rate, claims for unemployment insurance, job openings, nominal wage growth, and increases in payrolls, as well as in summary measures of the labor situation. Some participants observed that progress on labor force par- ticipation was lagging. Many participants noted that al- though the economic recovery had slowed recently and the August increase in payrolls had fallen short of expec- tations, the labor market had continued to show im- provement since the Committee’s previous meeting. A number of participants assessed that the standard of substantial further progress toward the goal of maxi- mum employment had not yet been attained but that, if the economy proceeded roughly as they anticipated, it may soon be reached. On the basis of the cumulative performance of the labor market since December 2020, a number of other participants indicated that they be- lieved that the test of “substantial further progress” to- ward maximum employment had been met. Some of these participants also suggested that labor supply con- straints were the main impediments to further improve- ment in labor market conditions rather than lack of de- mand. They noted that adding monetary policy accom- modation at this time would not address such con- straints or that the costs of continuing asset purchases might be beginning to exceed their benefits. All partici- pants agreed that it would be appropriate for the current meeting’s postmeeting statement to relay the Commit- tee’s judgment that, if progress continued broadly as ex- pected, a moderation in the pace of asset purchases may soon be warranted. Participants also expressed their views on how slowing in the pace of purchases might proceed. In particular, participants commented on an illustrative path, devel- oped by the staff and reflecting participants’ discussions at the Committee’s July meeting, that gave the speed and composition associated with a tapering of asset pur- chases. The illustrative tapering path was designed to be simple to communicate and entailed a gradual reduction in the pace of net asset purchases that, if begun later this year, would lead the Federal Reserve to end purchases around the middle of next year. The path featured monthly reductions in the pace of asset purchases, by $10 billion in the case of Treasury securities and $5 bil- lion in the case of agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS). Participants generally commented that the illus- trative path provided a straightforward and appropriate template that policymakers might follow, and a couple of participants observed that giving advance notice to the general public of a plan along these lines may reduce the risk of an adverse market reaction to a moderation in asset purchases. Participants noted that, in keeping with the outcome-based standard for initiating a tapering of asset purchases, the Committee could adjust the pace of the moderation of its purchases if economic develop- ments were to differ substantially from what they ex- pected. Several participants indicated that they preferred to proceed with a more rapid moderation of purchases than described in the illustrative examples. No decision to proceed with a moderation of asset pur- chases was made at the meeting, but participants gener- ally assessed that, provided that the economic recovery remained broadly on track, a gradual tapering process that concluded around the middle of next year would likely be appropriate. Participants noted that if a deci- sion to begin tapering purchases occurred at the next meeting, the process of tapering could commence with the monthly purchase calendars beginning in either mid- November or mid-December. Minutes of the Meeting of September 21–22, 2021 Page 9 _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Many participants remarked upon risk-management considerations and the way in which these figured into their thinking on asset purchases and the appropriate policy stance. A number of downside risks to the eco- nomic outlook were cited, including a potential tighten- ing of financial conditions, the possibility that another rise in COVID-19 cases would slow the economic re- covery by more than expected, and the prospect that fis- cal policy could become a source of economic head- winds as the effects of previous support measures re- ceded. Upside risks to the economic outlook included the possibility that there would be additional expansion- ary fiscal actions or that consumer spending would rise by more than expected as households reduced the large volume of savings that they had accumulated during the pandemic. With regard to inflation, upside risks cited included the possibility that elevated levels of inflation would continue for longer than expected, especially if la- bor and other supply shortages proved more persistent than currently anticipated, or that longer-term inflation expectations might move above levels consistent with the Committee’s longer-term inflation objective of 2 percent. Downside risks to inflation included the pos- sibility of a decline in inflation expectations that might occur if the public misconstrued the Federal Reserve’s reaction function as less accommodative than it actually was. Several participants expressed concern that the high degree of accommodation being provided by mon- etary policy, including through continued asset pur- chases, could increase risks to financial stability. Participants reaffirmed that the Committee’s “substan- tial further progress” standard regarding its asset pur- chases was distinct from the criteria given in its forward guidance on the federal funds rate and that a policy shift toward a moderation of asset purchases provided no di- rect signal about its interest rate policy. Rather, the Committee had articulated a different, and more strin- gent, test concerning the conditions that would need to be met before it started raising the target range for the federal funds rate. Various participants stressed that economic conditions were likely to justify keeping the rate at or near its lower bound over the next couple of years. In addition to noting that the economy was still well below maximum employment, several of these par- ticipants suggested that there would likely be sustained downward pressure on inflation in the years ahead. These participants stated that, in such circumstances, a major challenge facing policymakers—especially in the presence of the effective lower bound on the federal funds rate—was to maintain a policy stance sufficiently accommodative to keep average inflation at 2 percent and thereby bolster the credibility of the Committee’s new policy framework, facilitating the achievement of both maximum employment and price stability. In con- trast, a number of participants raised the possibility of beginning to increase the target range by the end of next year because they expected that the labor market and in- flation outcomes specified in the Committee’s guidance on the federal funds rate might be achieved by that time; some of these participants saw inflation as likely to re- main elevated in 2022 with risks to the upside. Committee Policy Action In their discussion of monetary policy for this meeting, members agreed that with progress on vaccinations and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment had continued to strengthen. They noted that the sectors most adversely affected by the pandemic had improved in recent months but that the rise in COVID-19 cases had slowed their recovery. In- flation was elevated, largely reflecting transitory factors. Overall financial conditions remained accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the econ- omy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and busi- nesses. Members also acknowledged that the path of the economy continued to depend on the course of the vi- rus. Progress on vaccinations would likely continue to reduce the effects of the public health crisis on the econ- omy, but risks to the economic outlook remained. Members agreed that the Federal Reserve was commit- ted to using its full range of tools to support the U.S. economy in this challenging time, thereby promoting its maximum employment and price stability goals. All members reaffirmed that, in accordance with the Com- mittee’s goals to achieve maximum employment and in- flation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run, and with inflation having run persistently below this longer- run goal, they would aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and longer-term inflation expecta- tions remain well anchored at 2 percent. Members ex- pected to maintain an accommodative stance of mone- tary policy until those outcomes were achieved. All members agreed to keep the target range for the fed- eral funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent, and they expected that it would be appropriate to maintain this target range un- til labor market conditions had reached levels consistent with the Committee’s assessments of maximum employ- ment and inflation had risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time. Last De- cember, the Committee indicated that it would continue to increase its holdings of Treasury securities by at least Page 10 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ $80 billion per month and of agency MBS by at least $40 billion per month until substantial further progress has been made toward its maximum employment and price stability goals. The members commented that, since then, the economy had made progress toward these goals and that, if progress continued broadly as ex- pected, a moderation in the pace of asset purchases may soon be warranted. They judged that these asset pur- chases would help foster smooth market functioning and accommodative financial conditions, thereby sup- porting the flow of credit to households and businesses. Members agreed that, in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, they would continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and that they would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate in the event that risks emerged that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals. Members also concurred that, in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, they would take into account a wide range of information, in- cluding readings on public health, labor market condi- tions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments. Members agreed that the postmeeting statement should acknowledge the slowing of the economic recovery, as indicated in data received since the July meeting, as well as ongoing elevated inflation readings. In light of these developments, they agreed that the Committee should indicate that the sectors of the economy most adversely affected by the pandemic had improved in recent months but that the rise in COVID-19 cases had slowed their recovery, and they also concurred that it would be appropriate to characterize inflation as being “elevated” in place of stating that inflation had “risen.” Members further decided to add to the postmeeting statement an indication that if progress toward the maximum-employ- ment and price-stability goals continued broadly as ex- pected, the Committee judged that a moderation in the pace of asset purchases may soon be warranted. Mem- bers agreed that the addition of this language was an ap- propriate means of acknowledging that, in the near fu- ture, the Committee would likely assess that the standard for reducing the pace of net asset purchases had been met. With regard to the directive to the Desk, members agreed that the directive should incorporate the pro- posed increase in the per-counterparty limit for the ON RRP facility to $160 billion. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the fol- lowing domestic policy directive, for release at 2:00 p.m.: “Effective September 23, 2021, the Federal Open Market Committee directs the Desk to:  Undertake open market operations as nec- essary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of 0 to ¼ percent.  Increase the System Open Market Account holdings of Treasury securities by $80 bil- lion per month and of agency mortgage- backed securities (MBS) by $40 billion per month.  Increase holdings of Treasury securities and agency MBS by additional amounts and purchase agency commercial mortgage- backed securities (CMBS) as needed to sus- tain smooth functioning of markets for these securities.  Conduct overnight repurchase agreement operations with a minimum bid rate of 0.25 percent and with an aggregate opera- tion limit of $500 billion; the aggregate op- eration limit can be temporarily increased at the discretion of the Chair.  Conduct overnight reverse repurchase agreement operations at an offering rate of 0.05 percent and with a per-counterparty limit of $160 billion per day; the per- counterparty limit can be temporarily in- creased at the discretion of the Chair.  Roll over at auction all principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of Treasury securities and reinvest all principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s hold- ings of agency debt and agency MBS in agency MBS.  Allow modest deviations from stated amounts for purchases and reinvestments, if needed for operational reasons.  Engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settle- ment of the Federal Reserve’s agency MBS transactions.” The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below for release at 2:00 p.m.: Minutes of the Meeting of September 21–22, 2021 Page 11 _____________________________________________________________________________________________ “The Federal Reserve is committed to using its full range of tools to support the U.S. economy in this challenging time, thereby promoting its maximum employment and price stability goals.

Powell, John C. Williams, Thomas I. Barkin, Raphael W. Bostic, Michelle W. Bowman, Lael Brainard, Richard H. Clarida, Mary C. Daly, Charles L. Evans, Randal K. Quarles, and Christopher J. Waller. Voting against this action: None. Consistent with the Committee’s decision to leave the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged, the Board voted unanimously to maintain the interest rate paid on reserve balances at 0.15 percent, effective Sep- tember 23, 2021. The Board also voted unanimously to approve establishment of the primary credit rate at the existing level of 0.25 percent, effective Septem- ber 23, 2021. Following the FOMC policy vote, the Chair emphasized that maintaining the public trust is absolutely essential for the work of the Federal Reserve. In light of recent questions regarding the financial transactions of senior officials, the Chair indicated that the staff would conduct a thorough review of the Federal Reserve’s current rules and regulations regarding the financial holdings and practices of Federal Reserve officials. This deliberate and thoughtful review will focus on strengthening Fed- eral Reserve rules and standards in ways that will help guard against even the appearance of conflicts of interest or any other improprieties. It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Tuesday–Wednesday, November 2– 3, 2021. The meeting adjourned at 10:45 a.m. on Sep- tember 22, 2021.

Prescott, Senior Economic and Policy Advisor, Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland Karel Mertens, Senior Economic Policy Advisor, Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas Mark Spiegel, Senior Policy Advisor, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco Brent Meyer, Policy Advisor and Economist, Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta Discussion of Financial Markets and Open Market Operations The manager turned first to a discussion of global finan- cial markets. Sovereign yields rose sharply across many advanced economies with much of the increase concen- trated in measures of inflation compensation. In the United States, the five-year measure of inflation com- pensation based on Treasury Inflation Protected Securi- ties (TIPS) rose by around 45 basis points. Far forward measures of inflation compensation also rose, but by modest amounts. In the Open Market Desk’s surveys of primary dealers and market participants, the median forecast for headline PCE inflation in 2021 was revised up notably. Median forecasts beyond 2021move up by less, although the average of the probabilities reported by survey respondents placed on higher inflation out- comes at these horizons increased modestly. Policy sensitive rates increased across most advanced economies. The central banks of Norway and New Zea- land raised their policy rates early in the period, and pol- icy communications from the Bank of England and the Bank of Canada pointed to the potential for earlier pol- icy firming than had been expected, contributing to the upward movement of global rates. The Reserve Bank of Australia ended its yield target for the April 2024 gov- ernment bond. That central bank signaled that condi- tions for raising the policy rate could be met in 2023 but were unlikely to be achieved in the earlier timeframe im- plied by market pricing. Some European Central Bank communications also suggested that market rates were likely not consistent with the outlook for policy. In the United States, the market-implied path of the fed- eral funds rate rose, implying an earlier date for raising the target range for the federal funds rate and a faster pace of rate hikes than was the case in September. Op- tion-implied volatility on short-dated interest rates in- creased, reportedly reflecting greater uncertainty over Page 2 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ the path of the federal funds rate. Desk survey re- sponses also indicated expectations for an earlier in- crease in the target range, although the median respond- ent’s modal expectation shifted by less than market pric- ing. The median survey respondent’s modal expectation for the federal funds rate at the end of 2025 was little changed suggesting that investors had not revised their expectations for the cumulative extent of policy firming over the next four years. Expectations for a reduction in the pace of net asset purchases coalesced further, and most survey respondents expected the tapering of asset purchases to start with the November purchase schedule with monthly reductions of $10 billion and $5 billion in Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securi- ties (MBS), respectively. Over the intermeeting period, U.S. equity indexes rose and the one-month option-implied volatility on the S&P 500—the VIX—fell to post-pandemic lows. Con- tinued strong earnings underpinned the rise in equity prices, with firms posting profits near historical highs. Despite signs of robust risk appetite, market participants continued to note prominent risks to the outlook, in- cluding ongoing challenges in the Chinese property sec- tor. Turning to Desk operations, the manager noted that, should the Committee decide to announce a reduction in the pace of net asset purchases at this meeting, the Desk would issue a monthly purchase schedule on No- vember 12 reflecting this change. The mid-December purchase schedule, to be released just before the next FOMC meeting, would reflect additional reductions of the same size. Treasury securities and agency MBS would continue to be purchased across sectors and cou- pons consistent with current practice. If similar reductions in the net purchase pace were im- plemented in subsequent months, the System Open Market Account (SOMA) portfolio would peak around next June at about $8.5 trillion. In terms of composition, Treasury securities and agency MBS would constitute roughly 70 percent and 30 percent of the SOMA port- folio, respectively—roughly in line with the shares of Treasury securities and agency MBS in the total stock of these securities outstanding—and the SOMA portfolio would be more heavily weighted toward Treasury secu- rities than after the conclusion of the third large-scale asset purchase program (LSAP 3) following the global financial crisis. The maturity composition of SOMA Treasury coupon holdings would also be fairly close to that of the outstanding universe of Treasury securities, and the weighted average maturity would be shorter than after LSAP 3. Turning to money market developments, the manager noted that the transition away from LIBOR (London In- terbank Offered Rate) had gained momentum with a pick-up in the interdealer trading volume of Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) derivatives; that said, much remained to be done to complete the LIBOR tran- sition. Market participants were attentive to some tem- porary downward pressure on the SOFR over the pe- riod. This softness appeared to be the result of technical factors and was observed primarily in centrally cleared repurchase agreement markets. The Federal Reserve’s administered rates—the interest on reserve balances rate and the overnight reverse repurchase agreement (ON RRP) rate—continued to support effective interest rate control and, outside of month- and quarter-end, the fed- eral funds rate remained stable over the period. Regarding the debt ceiling, the short-term resolution reached in October increased the debt limit by $480 bil- lion. Market participants’ estimates of the new date when the Treasury would exhaust its extraordinary measures and cash balance were wide-ranging but some estimates suggested the date might be as early as mid- December. Most market participants anticipated that a resolution to the debt ceiling would again be reached without a delayed payment on maturing Treasury secu- rities although uncertainty about the debt ceiling resolu- tion remained a source of concern in financial markets. By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk’s domestic transactions over the intermeeting period. There were no intervention operations in foreign curren- cies for the System’s account during the intermeeting pe- riod. Staff Review of the Economic Situation The information available at the time of the Novem- ber 2–3 meeting suggested that U.S. real GDP growth had slowed markedly in the third quarter after the first half’s rapid pace. Labor market conditions continued to improve in September, though employment growth was slower than in recent months. Consumer price inflation in September—as measured by the 12-month percent- age change in the PCE price index—was elevated. Growth in total nonfarm payroll employment slowed further in September, held down by a decline in state and local government employment. As of September, total payroll employment had retraced three-fourths of the losses seen at the onset of the pandemic. The unem- ployment rate declined from 5.2 percent in August to _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Minutes of the Meeting of November 2–3, 2021 Page 3 4.8 percent in September; the unemployment rates for African Americans and Hispanics also declined over this period, but both rates remained well above the national average. The labor force participation rate edged lower in September, and the employment-to-population ratio moved up. Private-sector job openings, as measured by the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, stepped down in August but remained well above pre-pandemic levels. Initial claims for regular state unemployment in- surance moved lower through late October and were ap- proaching the levels seen before the pandemic. Recent weekly estimates of private-sector payrolls constructed by the Board’s staff using data provided by the payroll processor ADP were especially volatile but, on balance, appeared consistent with a pickup in the pace of private employment gains relative to September. The employ- ment cost index of hourly compensation in the private sector rose 4.1 percent over the 12 months ending in September; this gain was noticeably larger than the in- dex’s year-earlier 12-month change and was the fastest 12-month change since 2001. Total PCE price inflation was 4.4 percent over the 12 months ending in September, and core PCE price in- flation, which excludes changes in consumer energy prices and many consumer food prices, was 3.6 percent over the same period. The trimmed mean measure of 12-month PCE inflation constructed by the Federal Re- serve Bank of Dallas was 2.3 percent in September. In the third quarter of 2021, the staff’s common inflation expectations index, which combines information from many indicators of inflation expectations and inflation compensation, was little changed relative to the second quarter and remained at its highest level since 2014. Real PCE posted a modest increase in the third quarter after having risen sharply over the first half of the year. The third-quarter slowdown appeared to reflect a com- bination of factors, including the waning effect of previ- ous fiscal stimulus measures, the surge in COVID-19 cases over the summer, and a plunge in motor vehicle purchases as extremely low dealer inventories con- strained sales. Residential investment dropped further in the third quarter; although demand for housing was strong, shortages of construction supplies as well as tight land and labor markets restrained residential construc- tion activity. Growth in business fixed investment slowed sharply in the third quarter, as supply bottlenecks—particularly for motor vehicles—weighed on business equipment spending and a limited availability of construction mate- rials held back spending on nonresidential structures. Manufacturing output declined in September. Motor ve- hicle output stepped down further as semiconductor shortages continued to restrain production; in addition, Hurricane Ida resulted in prolonged plant outages in the petrochemical, refining, and plastic resins industries. Total real government purchases posted a small increase in the third quarter after having declined in the second quarter. Although real state and local purchases in- creased, the gain was largely offset by declines in both federal defense and nondefense purchases. The U.S. international trade deficit widened in August, reflecting a moderate pace of import growth against a subdued pace of export growth. Real import growth was driven by increases in consumer goods and industrial supplies. Real export growth was held back by declines in capital goods, agricultural products, and automotive products. Bottlenecks in the global semiconductor in- dustry continued to weigh on exports and imports of au- tomotive products, and shipping congestion continued to restrain trade overall. Advance estimates for Septem- ber suggested that goods imports rose while goods ex- ports fell, pointing to a further widening of the trade def- icit. The Bureau of Economic Analysis estimated that a drop in net exports subtracted substantially from real GDP growth in the third quarter. Foreign GDP growth slowed modestly in the third quar- ter, as supply chain disruptions and the resurgence of COVID-19 weighed on production, particularly in China and other emerging market economies (EMEs). In several EMEs, public health restrictions were rein- stated, resulting in factory closures. Moreover, Chinese manufacturing output was curtailed by the rationing of electricity amid a coal shortage resulting in part from policies to lower carbon emissions. In contrast to EMEs, advanced foreign economies (AFEs) generally continued to recover at a solid pace in the third quarter, as the boost from the further reopening of high-contact services activity was only partially offset by the drag from bottlenecks, the spread of the virus, and, in some places, labor shortages. Twelve-month rates of inflation abroad continued to rise, reflecting further increases in energy prices, persistent pressures from supply bottle- necks, and past exchange rate depreciation in some EMEs. Staff Review of the Financial Situation Over the intermeeting period, an increase in perceived inflation risks and an associated upward revision in the market-implied path of the federal funds rate contrib- uted to increases in Treasury yields. Long-term sover- eign yields in AFEs also increased notably. Despite Page 4 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ these pressures, broad domestic equity indexes in- creased, on net, supported by strong earnings reports. Spreads of corporate bonds were little changed overall. Short-term funding markets were stable, while participa- tion in the ON RRP facility increased further, to its high- est level since the facility was put in place. Market-based financing conditions were accommodative, and bank lending standards eased for most loan categories. Market participants’ views on the expected path for the federal funds rate over the next few years—implied by a straight read of overnight index swap quotes—rose sub- stantially since the September FOMC meeting, appar- ently in response to perceived risks of higher inflation. Those risks also contributed to increases in Treasury yields, with 2-, 5-, and 10-year yields rising notably on net. Broad equity indexes increased, on net, over the inter- meeting period. Perceptions of increased risks related to inflation were more than offset by a short-term resolu- tion of the debt ceiling, a decrease in perceived risks re- lated to the effect of the pandemic on the pace of the economic recovery, and stronger-than-expected third- quarter earnings. The VIX declined notably to near pre- pandemic levels. Spreads on corporate bonds were little changed, on net, over the intermeeting period and re- mained at low levels. Spreads of municipal bonds nar- rowed slightly. Short-term funding markets were stable over the inter- meeting period. The effective federal funds rate re- mained at 8 basis points throughout the period except on month-ends, while the SOFR averaged 5 basis points. Consistent with relatively low Treasury bill supply and abundant liquidity, participation in ON RRP operations increased from an average of $1.1 trillion over the previ- ous intermeeting period to $1.4 trillion, reaching a new high of $1.6 trillion on the September quarter-end. In major foreign markets, sovereign yields rose notably over the intermeeting period, as did inflation compensa- tion and market-implied measures of expected policy rates, amid sharp further increases in energy prices, con- cerns about higher inflation, and communications by some foreign central banks that were seen as signaling a faster removal of monetary policy accommodation. Market concerns about risks of a downturn in the Chi- nese real estate sector remained elevated, and inflows into funds investing in China slowed, but the effects on broader financial markets were limited. On balance, ma- jor foreign equity indexes increased moderately, and the broad dollar appreciated a touch. In domestic credit markets, financing conditions faced by nonfinancial firms in capital markets remained highly accommodative over the intermeeting period. Gross corporate bond issuance stayed strong in September and October. Gross leveraged loan issuance decreased slightly in September after its strong growth in August. Equity raised through traditional initial public offerings remained robust in September and October, while equity issuance through special purpose acquisition companies remained at the subdued levels seen in recent months. Commercial and industrial (C&I) loans declined notably in the third quarter amid ongoing forgiveness of Paycheck Protection Program loans. In the October Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices (SLOOS), banks reported easing standards and terms, on net, for C&I loans over the third quarter. Banks also reported that demand for C&I loans was about unchanged over the third quarter after strength- ening for the previous two quarters; on balance, loan de- mand was still weaker than before the pandemic. The credit quality of large nonfinancial corporations re- mained strong. The volume of credit rating upgrades for speculative-grade nonfinancial corporate bonds out- paced downgrades in September and October. Trailing default rates on corporate bonds and leveraged loans de- creased from already low levels, while market indicators of future expected default rates remained benign. In the municipal bond market, financing conditions re- mained accommodative despite a modest increase in yields. Issuance of municipal debt was strong in Sep- tember and October, and indicators of the credit quality of municipal debt remained healthy. Survey-based indicators suggested that small business owners became less pessimistic about their financial pro- spects, with the exception of owners in the educational services sector, for whom expectations deteriorated slightly. While loan originations to small businesses fell a bit, the results from the October SLOOS suggested that the decline appeared to reflect weak demand, par- ticularly for small and very small firms. Commercial real estate loan balances on banks’ books strengthened, and, in the October SLOOS, banks re- ported an easing of standards on such loans over the third quarter. Issuance of commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) remained robust, supported by spreads of agency CMBS generally at or below pre-pan- demic levels. Delinquency rates on mortgages in CMBS pools continued to fall but remained elevated for CMBS backed by hotel and retail properties. _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Minutes of the Meeting of November 2–3, 2021 Page 5 In the residential mortgage market, financing conditions remained accommodative, particularly for borrowers who met standard conforming loan criteria. In the Oc- tober SLOOS, banks reported easing lending standards for almost all major mortgage categories. Mortgage rates increased modestly over the intermeeting period but did not rise as much as the 10-year Treasury yield. Indica- tors of mortgage originations for home purchases and refinancing remained fairly robust. The share of mort- gages in forbearance continued to decline through Oc- tober, and the rate of new transitions into delinquency stayed low by historical standards. Financing conditions for consumer credit remained ac- commodative for most borrowers, especially those with stronger credit scores. Lending standards for nonprime consumers in the credit card market continued to ease but remained slightly tighter than pre-pandemic levels. In the October SLOOS, banks reported easier standards for credit cards and auto loans over the third quarter. While demand for credit cards strengthened, auto loan growth slowed in response to low dealer inventories and a weakening of auto sales. The staff provided an update on indicators related to the stability of the financial system. The staff noted that as- set valuations remained generally high relative to histor- ical norms. In particular, bond and leveraged loan spreads remained narrow, while equity prices continued to increase, supported by strong earnings expectations, still-low Treasury yields, and high risk appetite. House prices rose rapidly, outpacing rents, but the staff did not see signs of loose mortgage underwriting standards or excessive mortgage credit growth that could potentially amplify a shock arising from falling house prices. For households, the level of consumer debt was largely un- changed on an inflation-adjusted basis, while delinquen- cies returned to pre-pandemic levels or below. For non- financial businesses, measures of leverage in the corpo- rate sector fell over the second quarter and largely re- turned to pre-pandemic levels; in addition, the level of corporate debt became more sustainable as earnings in- creased and rates remained low. In the financial sector, the staff noted that banks were strongly capitalized, with high levels of stable funding and high-quality liquid as- sets. The mean level of gross hedge fund leverage was noteworthy and its distribution was skewed, with partic- ularly high leverage among funds in the top decile. Vul- nerabilities associated with funding risks remained at money funds and other mutual funds. In addition, fund- ing risks were an emerging concern at entities issuing sta- blecoins, because they appeared to have structural ma- turity and liquidity transformation vulnerabilities similar to those for money funds but with considerably less transparency and an underdeveloped regulatory frame- work. The staff noted that the President’s Working Group on Financial Markets was engaged in interagency work to address these risks. Staff Economic Outlook The projection for U.S. economic activity prepared by the staff for the November FOMC meeting was slightly weaker than the September projection. Incoming data suggested that the resolution of supply constraints was starting later and would be more gradual than previously assumed; even so, real GDP was expected to post a siz- able gain over 2021 as a whole. In 2022, real GDP growth was expected to remain close to its 2021 pace, supported by the continued reopening of the economy and the resolution of supply constraints in most sectors. With the boost from these factors fading, real GDP growth was projected to step down noticeably in 2023 and to be close to potential output growth in 2023 and 2024. However, the level of real GDP was expected to remain well above potential throughout the projection period, and the unemployment rate was expected to de- cline to historically low levels. The staff’s near-term outlook for inflation was revised up, as consumer food and energy prices had risen faster than expected and production bottlenecks and recent wage gains were seen as putting somewhat greater up- ward pressure on prices than had been anticipated. As a result, the 12-month change in PCE prices was projected to move up further relative to September’s pace and to end the year well above 2 percent. Over the following two years, the boost to consumer prices caused by sup- ply issues was expected to partly reverse, and resource utilization was projected to tighten further. PCE price inflation was therefore expected to step down to 2 per- cent in 2022 and to 1.9 percent in 2023 before edging back up to 2 percent in 2024. The staff continued to judge that the risks to the baseline projection for economic activity were skewed to the downside and that the risks around the inflation projec- tion were skewed to the upside. In particular, the possi- bility of another sizable wave of COVID-19 cases in the winter was seen as an important source of downside risk to activity, while the possibility of more severe and per- sistent supply issues was viewed as an additional down- side risk to activity and as an upside risk to inflation. Participants’ Views on Current Economic Condi- tions and the Economic Outlook In their discussion of current conditions, participants noted that, with progress on vaccinations and strong Page 6 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ policy support, indicators of economic activity and em- ployment had continued to strengthen. The sectors most adversely affected by the pandemic had improved in recent months, but the summer’s rise in COVID-19 cases had slowed their recovery. Inflation was elevated, largely reflecting factors that were expected to be transi- tory. Supply and demand imbalances related to the pan- demic and the reopening of the economy had contrib- uted to sizable price increases in some sectors. Overall financial conditions remained accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses. Participants noted that the path of the economy contin- ued to depend on the course of the virus. Progress on vaccinations and an easing of supply constraints were ex- pected to support continued gains in economic activity and employment as well as a reduction in inflation, but risks to the economic outlook remained. Participants observed that growth in economic activity had slowed in the third quarter to a rate significantly be- low the robust pace seen in the first half of the year. The spread of the Delta variant had contributed to the slow- down in growth in the third quarter by damping house- hold and business spending, holding down labor supply, and intensifying supply chain disruptions. Participants noted that the underlying conditions supporting growth in demand remained strong and that, as the number of COVID-19 cases remained well below the summer’s lev- els, growth in economic activity would likely show a pickup in the fourth quarter. They further foresaw ro- bust growth in 2022, supported by progress on vaccina- tions and an easing of supply constraints. In their discussion of the household sector, participants remarked that demand for most consumer goods had re- mained strong. They noted that businesses had generally recorded robust sales despite labor shortages and other supply disruptions that had prevented them from fully meeting higher demand for their products. Participants interpreted available data as suggesting that the spread of the Delta variant had slowed the shift of consumer demand toward purchases of services and away from spending on goods, stretching out the full reopening of the economy and intensifying supply and demand imbal- ances. Participants observed that households had strong balance sheets and that consumer spending would also be supported by accommodative financial conditions. A number of participants noted that there was likely to be a drag on household spending as previous fiscal support faded, or that fiscal policy might provide some support to aggregate demand if the Congress authorized major new federal appropriations. Participants remarked that supply chain challenges and limited labor availability continued to be major con- straints on manufacturing activity and the business sec- tor more broadly. Bottleneck pressures faced by busi- nesses were accompanied by global supply chain disrup- tions associated with major backlogs in shipments and transportation as well as surging demand for a variety of goods, shortages of labor and other inputs, increases in costs of production, and depleted inventory levels in key sectors. Many business contacts had experienced a worsening of supply chain problems, and participants re- ported that firms had responded to these challenges by taking a variety of actions, including raising prices, turn- ing away customers, restructuring supply chains, and us- ing alternative, but higher-cost, shipping options. Par- ticipants judged that supply constraints would likely con- tinue for longer than they had previously expected. Participants noted that data received over the intermeet- ing period indicated that labor market conditions had continued to improve. Although the September increase in payrolls had been moderate compared with recent months, the unemployment rate had declined further and previous months’ job growth had been revised up. Participants observed that September’s rise in payrolls had been held down by a shortage of workers, in part reflecting the ongoing effect of the virus on labor supply decisions. With COVID-19 cases expected to remain below the summer’s levels, participants anticipated bet- ter payroll numbers in the months ahead. Participants indicated that District contacts continued to report dif- ficulties in finding and retaining workers and that, in ad- dition to offering higher wages, businesses were turning to increased use of automation. While recognizing that labor market conditions varied significantly across the country, some participants cited a number of signs that the U.S. labor market was very tight: These included data on quits, job availability, and stronger rates of nominal wage growth reflected in the recent rise in the employment cost index, as well as the readings provided by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kan- sas City’s Labor Market Conditions Indicators. A num- ber of participants observed that the labor force partici- pation rate remained well below the level reached before the pandemic. Several participants judged that labor force participation would be structurally lower than in the past, and a few of these participants cited the high level of retirements recorded since the start of the pan- demic. Several other participants suggested that labor supply was currently being depressed by pandemic-re- lated factors such as disruptions related to caregiving ar- _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Minutes of the Meeting of November 2–3, 2021 Page 7 rangements and noted that the importance of such fac- tors would likely diminish as economic and public health conditions improved further. Participants generally saw the current elevated level of inflation as largely reflecting factors that were likely to be transitory but judged that inflation pressures could take longer to subside than they had previously assessed. They remarked that the Delta wave had intensified the impediments to supply chains and had helped sustain the high level of goods demand, adding to the upward pres- sure on prices. Participants also observed that increases in energy prices, stronger rates of nominal wage growth, and higher housing rental costs had been forces adding to inflation. Some participants highlighted the fact that price increases had become more widespread. Although participants expected significant inflation pressures to last for longer than they previously expected, they gen- erally continued to anticipate that the inflation rate would diminish significantly during 2022 as supply and demand imbalances abated. Nonetheless, they indicated that their uncertainty regarding this assessment had in- creased. Many participants pointed to considerations that might suggest that elevated inflation could prove more persistent. These participants noted that average inflation already exceeded 2 percent when measured on a multiyear basis and cited a number of factors—such as businesses’ enhanced scope to pass on higher costs to their customers, the possibility that nominal wage growth had become more sensitive to labor market pres- sures, or accommodative financial conditions—that might result in inflation continuing at elevated levels. Some other participants, however, remarked that al- though inflationary pressures were lasting longer than anticipated, those pressures continued to reflect the same pandemic-related imbalances and would likely abate when supply constraints eased. These participants also noted that the most sizable price increases may have already occurred, that there was as yet little evidence of a change in inflation dynamics—such as the develop- ment of a wage–price spiral—that would tend to pro- long elevated levels of inflation, and that forces already in motion would likely bring inflation down toward 2 percent over the medium term. Participants were at- tentive to the sizable increase in the cost of living that had taken place this year and the associated burden on U.S. households, particularly those who had limited scope to pay higher prices for essential goods and ser- vices. In their comments on inflation expectations, a number of participants discussed the risk that, in light of recent elevated levels of inflation, the public’s longer-term ex- pectations of inflation might increase to a level above that consistent with the Committee’s longer-run infla- tion objective; such a development could make it harder for the Committee to achieve 2 percent inflation over the longer run. A couple of participants pointed to in- creases in survey- and market-based indicators of ex- pected inflation—including the notable rise in the five- year TIPS-based measure of inflation compensation—as possible signs that inflation expectations were becoming less well anchored. Several other participants, however, remarked that measures of near- and medium-term in- flation expectations typically had been sensitive to movements in realized inflation and that they had not exhibited greater sensitivity recently. They additionally pointed out that indicators of longer-term inflation ex- pectations—including the five-year, five-year-forward measure of inflation compensation—continued to dis- play less sensitivity to realized inflation and remained well anchored at levels consistent with the Committee’s longer-run 2 percent goal. Participants observed that uncertainty about the eco- nomic outlook remained high. They particularly stressed uncertainties associated with the labor market, including the evolution of labor force participation, and with the length of time required to resolve the supply chain situ- ation. Participants cited upside risks to inflation, includ- ing those associated with strong demand for goods and a tight labor market. Upside risks to economic activity included a potential near-term boost to aggregate de- mand that could arise from the drawing down of the substantial savings accumulated by households since the beginning of the pandemic. A few participants men- tioned an upsurge in COVID-19 cases during the com- ing winter or an emergence of new virus strains as pos- sibilities that, if they were realized, would damp eco- nomic activity and intensify price pressures. A number of participants commented on issues related to financial stability. A couple of participants noted fac- tors supporting the strength and resilience of the U.S. fi- nancial system, including the solid capital and liquidity conditions of banks and the fact that underwriting stand- ards for residential mortgages had not eased substantially in an environment of rising house prices. A few partici- pants emphasized the importance of maintaining strong bank capital positions, particularly at the largest banks. A few participants also cited a number of factors repre- senting potential vulnerabilities to the financial system: These included elevated asset valuations prevailing widely across asset classes, the growing exposure of Page 8 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ banks to nonbank financial firms, and the risk of a sud- den reduction in the liquidity of collateral used at central counterparty clearing and settlement systems. In the area of cybersecurity, a few participants stressed the im- portance of greater preparedness against a cyberattack that could disrupt the nation’s payments process and fi- nancial system. Several participants commented on the financial stability risks—including those relating to ma- turity and liquidity transformation—associated with sta- blecoins and on the need for regulators to address these risks. A few participants noted the importance of devel- oping systematic monitoring of the climate-related risks facing the financial system. In their consideration of the stance of monetary policy, participants agreed that the economy had made substan- tial further progress toward the Committee’s goals since December 2020, when the Committee adopted its guid- ance regarding asset purchases. The unemployment rate had declined to 4.8 percent in September—about 2 per- centage points lower than the level last December—and job openings and other indicators also were pointing to widespread strength in labor demand, consistent with a broad improvement in labor market conditions. Conse- quently, participants assessed that the criterion of sub- stantial further progress had been met with regard to the Committee’s maximum employment goal. In addition, participants generally judged that the Committee’s crite- rion of substantial further progress had clearly been more than met with respect to inflation. Against this backdrop, all participants judged that, consistent with the Committee’s previous policy communications, it would be appropriate to announce at this meeting a re- duction in the pace of net asset purchases. Participants generally supported the plan to implement reductions in the pace of net purchases of Treasury securities and agency MBS by $10 billion and $5 billion per month, re- spectively, over the upcoming intermeeting period and judged that similar reductions in the pace would likely be appropriate in each subsequent month. Some partici- pants preferred a somewhat faster pace of reductions that would result in an earlier conclusion to net pur- chases. Participants noted that beginning to scale back the pace of net asset purchases was not intended to con- vey any direct signal regarding adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate. They highlighted the more stringent criteria for raising the target range, com- pared with the criteria that applied to beginning to re- duce the pace of asset purchases. Participants stressed that maintaining flexibility to imple- ment appropriate policy adjustments on the basis of risk- management considerations should be a guiding princi- ple in conducting policy in the current highly uncertain environment. Some participants suggested that reducing the pace of net asset purchases by more than $15 billion each month could be warranted so that the Committee would be in a better position to make adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, particularly in light of inflation pressures. Various participants noted that the Committee should be prepared to adjust the pace of asset purchases and raise the target range for the federal funds rate sooner than participants currently anticipated if inflation continued to run higher than levels consistent with the Committee’s objectives. At the same time, be- cause of the continuing considerable uncertainty about developments in supply chains, production logistics, and the course of the virus, a number of participants stressed that a patient attitude toward incoming data remained appropriate to allow for careful evaluation of evolving supply chain developments and their implications for the labor market and inflation. That said, participants noted that the Committee would not hesitate to take appropri- ate actions to address inflation pressures that posed risks to its longer-run price stability and employment objec- tives. Committee Policy Action In their discussion of monetary policy for this meeting, members agreed that with progress on vaccinations and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment had continued to strengthen. They noted that the sectors most adversely affected by the pandemic had improved in recent months but that the summer’s rise in COVID-19 cases had slowed their re- covery. Inflation was elevated, largely reflecting factors that were expected to be transitory. They remarked that supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic and the reopening of the economy had contributed to sizable price increases in some sectors. Overall financial conditions remained accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses. Members also acknowledged that the path of the economy continued to depend on the course of the virus. Progress on vac- cinations and an easing of supply constraints were ex- pected to support continued gains in economic activity and employment as well as a reduction in inflation, but risks to the economic outlook remained. Members agreed that the postmeeting statement should acknowledge that the sectors of the economy most ad- versely affected by the pandemic had improved in recent months, but that the summer’s rise in COVID-19 cases had slowed their recovery. They also concurred that it _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Minutes of the Meeting of November 2–3, 2021 Page 9 would be appropriate to convey less certainty about the path of inflation by noting that the factors driving ele- vated inflation “are expected to be transitory.” In order to provide additional information about these factors, members further decided that the postmeeting state- ment would say that “supply and demand imbalances re- lated to the pandemic and the reopening of the economy have contributed to sizable price increases in some sec- tors.” Members also agreed to include a sentence stating that “progress on vaccinations and an easing of supply constraints are expected to support continued gains in economic activity and employment as well as a reduction in inflation.” Members agreed that the Federal Reserve was commit- ted to using its full range of tools to support the U.S. economy in this challenging time, thereby promoting its maximum employment and price stability goals. All members reaffirmed that, in accordance with the Com- mittee’s goals to achieve maximum employment and in- flation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run, and with inflation having run persistently below this longer- run goal, they would aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and longer-term inflation expecta- tions remain well anchored at 2 percent. Members ex- pected to maintain an accommodative stance of mone- tary policy until those outcomes were achieved. In their discussion of monetary policy in the period ahead, members agreed that, in light of the substantial further progress the economy had made toward the Committee’s goals since last December, the Committee should begin to slow the pace of its asset purchases at this meeting. Consistent with this approach, the Com- mittee decided to start reducing the monthly pace of its net asset purchases by $10 billion for Treasury securities and $5 billion for agency MBS. Consequently, the Com- mittee agreed that, beginning with the purchase schedule published in mid-November, it would increase its hold- ings of Treasury securities by at least $70 billion per month rather than $80 billion per month and would in- crease its holdings of agency MBS by at least $35 billion per month, rather than $40 billion per month. Because the Open Market Desk would be releasing two monthly purchase schedules between the November and December FOMC meetings, the Committee further de- cided to add to the postmeeting statement an indication that, beginning in December, the Committee would in- crease its holdings of Treasury securities by at least $60 billion per month and of agency MBS by at least $30 billion per month. Members decided the postmeeting statement should state that the Committee judged that similar reductions in the pace of net asset purchases would likely be appro- priate in subsequent months, implying that increases in securities holdings would cease by the middle of next year under the Committee’s outlook. Members also noted that the Committee was prepared to adjust the pace of purchases if warranted by changes in the eco- nomic outlook and agreed that the postmeeting state- ment should say so. Members agreed that the addition of this language would acknowledge the importance of maintaining flexibility to adjust the stance of policy as appropriate in response to changes in the Committee’s outlook for the labor market and inflation. Members agreed that the statement should continue to note that the Committee’s ongoing asset purchases helped foster smooth market functioning and accommodative finan- cial conditions. Additionally, members decided to intro- duce into the postmeeting statement a reference to the Federal Reserve’s “holdings of securities” in the sen- tence describing the economic effects of asset purchases. This addition would make clear that, even after net in- creases in the SOMA portfolio ceased, the Federal Re- serve’s elevated securities holdings would continue to support accommodative financial conditions. Members agreed that, in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, they would continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and that they would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate in the event that risks emerged that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals. They also concurred that, in as- sessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, they would take into account a wide range of information, in- cluding readings on public health, labor market condi- tions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the fol- lowing domestic policy directive, for release at 2:00 p.m.: “Effective November 4, 2021, the Federal Open Market Committee directs the Desk to:  Undertake open market operations as nec- essary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of 0 to ¼ percent.  Complete the increase in System Open Market Account (SOMA) holdings of Page 10 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Treasury securities by $80 billion and of agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) by $40 billion, as indicated in the monthly purchase plans released in mid-October.  Increase the SOMA holdings of Treasury securities by $70 billion and of agency MBS by $35 billion, during the monthly purchase period beginning in mid-November.  Increase the SOMA holdings of Treasury securities by $60 billion and of agency MBS by $30 billion, during the monthly purchase period beginning in mid-December.  Increase holdings of Treasury securities and agency MBS by additional amounts as needed to sustain smooth functioning of markets for these securities.  Conduct overnight repurchase agreement operations with a minimum bid rate of 0.25 percent and with an aggregate opera- tion limit of $500 billion; the aggregate op- eration limit can be temporarily increased at the discretion of the Chair.  Conduct overnight reverse repurchase agreement operations at an offering rate of 0.05 percent and with a per-counterparty limit of $160 billion per day; the per-coun- terparty limit can be temporarily increased at the discretion of the Chair.  Roll over at auction all principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of Treasury securities and reinvest all principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s hold- ings of agency debt and agency MBS in agency MBS.  Allow modest deviations from stated amounts for purchases and reinvestments, if needed for operational reasons.  Engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settle- ment of the Federal Reserve’s agency MBS transactions.” The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below for release at 2:00 p.m.: “The Federal Reserve is committed to using its full range of tools to support the U.S. economy in this challenging time, thereby promoting its maximum employment and price stability goals. With progress on vaccinations and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment have continued to strengthen. The sectors most adversely affected by the pandemic have improved in recent months, but the sum- mer’s rise in COVID-19 cases has slowed their recovery. Inflation is elevated, largely reflecting factors that are expected to be transitory. Sup- ply and demand imbalances related to the pan- demic and the reopening of the economy have contributed to sizable price increases in some sectors. Overall financial conditions remain ac- commodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses. The path of the economy continues to depend on the course of the virus. Progress on vaccina- tions and an easing of supply constraints are ex- pected to support continued gains in economic activity and employment as well as a reduction in inflation. Risks to the economic outlook re- main. The Committee seeks to achieve maximum em- ployment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. With inflation having run persistently below this longer-run goal, the Committee will aim to achieve inflation moder- ately above 2 percent for some time so that in- flation averages 2 percent over time and longer- term inflation expectations remain well an- chored at 2 percent. The Committee expects to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these outcomes are achieved. The Committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and ex- pects it will be appropriate to maintain this tar- get range until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee’s assessments of maximum employment and in- flation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time. In light of the substantial further progress the economy has made toward the Committee’s goals since last December, the Committee de- cided to begin reducing the monthly pace of its net asset purchases by $10 billion for Treasury securities and $5 billion for agency mortgage- backed securities. Beginning later this month, the Committee will increase its holdings of Treasury securities by at least $70 billion per _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Minutes of the Meeting of November 2–3, 2021 Page 11 month and of agency mortgage-backed securi- ties by at least $35 billion per month. Beginning in December, the Committee will increase its holdings of Treasury securities by at least $60 billion per month and of agency mortgage- backed securities by at least $30 billion per month. The Committee judges that similar re- ductions in the pace of net asset purchases will likely be appropriate each month, but it is pre- pared to adjust the pace of purchases if war- ranted by changes in the economic outlook. The Federal Reserve’s ongoing purchases and holdings of securities will continue to foster smooth market functioning and accommoda- tive financial conditions, thereby supporting the flow of credit to households and businesses. In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals. The Committee’s assessments will take into account a wide range of information, in- cluding readings on public health, labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation ex- pectations, and financial and international de- velopments.” Voting for this action: Jerome H. Powell, John C. Williams, Thomas I. Barkin, Raphael W. Bostic, Michelle W. Bowman, Lael Brainard, Richard H. Clarida, Mary C. Daly, Charles L. Evans, Randal K. Quarles, and Christopher J. Waller. Voting against this action: None. Consistent with the Committee’s decision to leave the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged, the Board voted unanimously to maintain the interest rate paid on reserve balances at 0.15 percent, effective No- vember 4, 2021. The Board also voted unanimously to approve establishment of the primary credit rate at the existing level of 0.25 percent, effective November 4, 2021. Following these actions, the Chair commented on the critical importance of maintaining the public’s trust and confidence in the Federal Reserve as an institution. In this regard, the Chair noted the recent announcement of changes in the rules regarding financial investments and transactions for Federal Reserve officials and indicated that efforts were under way to implement these new rules expeditiously. It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Tuesday–Wednesday, December 14– 15, 2021. The meeting adjourned at 10:35 a.m. on No- vember 3, 2021.

Financial mar- kets responded to significant new information about the economy and monetary policy, as well as the emergence of the Omicron variant. Overall, domestic financial con- ditions tightened modestly but remained near historically accommodative levels. Expectations for an earlier re- duction in Federal Reserve policy accommodation lifted short-term interest rates and supported the dollar. While prices of equities that are sensitive to COVID-19 risks declined significantly, the S&P 500 index was little changed. Over the period, market participants considered poten- tial drivers of the notable decline in far-forward sover- eign yields in the United States and other advanced econ- omies. News of the Omicron variant reportedly drove safe-haven flows into sovereign bonds, pushing term premiums lower. The significant co-movement between far-forward yields and the share prices of firms most af- fected by social distancing was consistent with this inter- pretation. In addition to the effects of the pandemic on risk sentiment, some discussed the potential for COVID to become endemic, possibly resulting in modestly lower potential growth over time and a lower long-run neutral level of the federal funds rate. Regarding the outlook for U.S. monetary policy, expec- tations for a reduction in policy accommodation shifted forward notably. Respondents to the Open Market Page 2 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Desk’s surveys of primary dealers and market partici- pants broadly projected that the Committee would quicken the pace of reduction in the Federal Reserve’s net purchases of Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS), and the median re- spondent projected net asset purchases to end in March 2022. The median respondent’s projected timing for the first increase in the target range for the federal funds rate also moved earlier from the first quarter of 2023 to June 2022. Although the Desk surveys and interest rate futures in- dicated expectations for earlier increases in the target range than at the time of the November meeting, expec- tations for the federal funds rate at longer horizons did not appear to have risen. In addition, the average of probability distributions for the federal funds rate re- ported in the Desk surveys suggested considerable un- certainty about the path of the federal funds rate, as sur- vey respondents placed significant odds on a range of outcomes. With the likely timing of the beginning of the removal of policy accommodation considered closer, market participants began to discuss how balance sheet policy might feature in the Committee’s plan for reduc- ing accommodation when warranted, although expecta- tions for the timing of the first decline in the balance sheet were diffuse. The manager turned next to a discussion of foreign de- velopments. Foreign policy-sensitive rates were rela- tively steady over the intermeeting period, as several cen- tral banks in advanced foreign economies (AFEs) sig- naled somewhat cautious approaches to the removal of policy accommodation. Market participants continued to focus on risks related to economic and financial de- velopments in China, though near-term concerns had moderated some following steps by Chinese authorities to ease policy. Turning to Desk operations and money markets, the manager noted that the Desk had reduced net purchases of Treasury securities and agency MBS in accordance with the directive issued at the November meeting. Overall, the transition to a slower pace of purchases had gone smoothly. In money markets, news that a path had emerged to a resolution of the debt ceiling impasse led yields on Treasury bills maturing in December and Jan- uary to decline. Following the resolution, the Treasury was expected to increase bill issuance to restore the Treasury General Account to more normal levels. Mar- ket participants generally were not anticipating signifi- cant strains in money market conditions over year end. In discussing recently established backstop facilities, the manager noted continued progress towards expanding access to the standing repurchase agreement (repo) fa- cility (SRF) to depository institutions; a number of insti- tutions were currently in the process of becoming SRF counterparties. The Federal Reserve also continued to onboard new counterparties for the Foreign and Inter- national Monetary Authorities Repo Facility, and cus- tomers to the facility now represented the majority of foreign and international monetary authorities’ custody holdings of Treasury securities at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The temporary dollar liquidity swap lines established in March 2020 were set to expire on December 31; the Committee’s foreign currency di- rective would be updated at the January meeting to re- flect the expiration of those lines. Finally, the manager provided an update on the transi- tion away from LIBOR (London interbank offered rate). Overall, considerable progress had been made in the transition away from LIBOR to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) in cash and derivatives markets. However, a few key areas of work remained. By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk’s domestic transactions over the intermeeting period. There were no intervention operations in foreign curren- cies for the System’s account during the intermeeting pe- riod. Discussion of Policy Normalization Considerations Participants began a discussion of a range of topics as- sociated with the eventual normalization of the stance of monetary policy. The topics included the lessons learned from the Committee’s previous experience with policy normalization, alternative approaches for remov- ing policy accommodation, the timing and sequencing of policy normalization actions, and the appropriate size and composition of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet in the longer run. They agreed that their discussion at this meeting would be helpful background for the Com- mittee’s future decisions regarding policy normalization. No decisions regarding the Committee’s approach were made at the meeting. The participants’ discussion was preceded by staff presentations. The staff reviewed the previous normali- zation episode, including how the Committee com- menced normalization by raising the target range for the federal funds rate and then reducing the Federal Re- serve’s asset holdings in a gradual and predictable man- ner, as well as the timing of these steps. The staff then discussed some of the channels through which policy rate and balance sheet actions affect financial conditions Minutes of the Meeting of December 14–15, 2021 Page 3 _____________________________________________________________________________________________ and alternative ways these tools could be deployed to re- duce policy accommodation in support of the Commit- tee’s macroeconomic goals. The staff presentation in- cluded assessments of the implications for the yield curve of alternative settings of the two tools, the relative uncertainty of the effects of each tool, and the challenges associated with conducting and communicating policy with multiple tools. Finally, the staff reviewed the expe- rience of foreign central banks with policy normaliza- tion. Participants judged that several aspects of the previous approach remained applicable in the current environ- ment. In particular, they noted that the principles and plans underlying policy normalization were communi- cated in advance of any decisions or actions, which en- hanced the public’s understanding and thus the effec- tiveness of monetary policy during that period. At the same time, participants remarked that the previous ex- perience highlighted the benefits of maintaining the flex- ibility to adjust the details of the approach to normaliza- tion in response to economic and financial develop- ments. Participants generally emphasized that, as in the previous normalization episode and as expressed in the Committee’s Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Mon- etary Policy Strategy, changes in the target range for the federal funds rate should be the Committee’s primary means for adjusting the stance of monetary policy in support of its maximum-employment and price-stability objectives. This preference reflected the view that there is less uncertainty about the effects of changes in the fed- eral funds rate on the economy than about the effects of changes in the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet. Moreo- ver, participants stated that the federal funds rate is a more familiar tool to the general public and therefore is advantageous for communication purposes. A few par- ticipants also noted that when the federal funds rate is away from the effective lower bound (ELB), the Com- mittee could more nimbly change interest rate policy than balance sheet policy in response to economic con- ditions. Participants also discussed some key differences be- tween current economic conditions and those that pre- vailed during the previous episode and remarked that the Committee would have to take these differences into ac- count in removing policy accommodation. Most nota- bly, participants remarked that the current economic outlook was much stronger, with higher inflation and a tighter labor market than at the beginning of the previ- ous normalization episode. They also observed that the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet was much larger, both in dollar terms and relative to nominal gross domestic product (GDP), than it was at the end of the third large- scale asset purchase program in late 2014. Participants noted that the current weighted average maturity of the Federal Reserve’s Treasury holdings was shorter than at the beginning of the previous normalization episode. Some observed that, as a result, depending on the size of any caps put on the pace of runoff, the balance sheet could potentially shrink faster than last time if the Com- mittee followed its previous approach in phasing out the reinvestment of maturing Treasury securities and princi- pal payments on agency MBS. However, several partic- ipants raised concerns about vulnerabilities in the Treas- ury market and how those vulnerabilities could affect the appropriate pace of balance sheet normalization. A cou- ple of participants noted that the SRF could help to mit- igate such concerns. Participants also judged the Federal Reserve to be better positioned for normalization than in the past, as the ample-reserves framework and the Federal Reserve’s current interest rate control tools, in- cluding interest on reserve balances and the overnight reverse repurchase agreement (ON RRP) facility, are in place and working well. Some participants judged that a significant amount of balance sheet shrinkage could be appropriate over the normalization process, especially in light of abundant liquidity in money markets and ele- vated usage of the ON RRP facility. Participants had an initial discussion about the appropri- ate conditions and timing for starting balance sheet run- off relative to raising the federal funds rate from the ELB. They also discussed how this relative timing might differ from the previous experience, in which balance sheet runoff commenced almost two years after policy rate liftoff when the normalization of the federal funds rate was judged to be well under way. Almost all partic- ipants agreed that it would likely be appropriate to initi- ate balance sheet runoff at some point after the first in- crease in the target range for the federal funds rate. However, participants judged that the appropriate tim- ing of balance sheet runoff would likely be closer to that of policy rate liftoff than in the Committee’s previous experience. They noted that current conditions included a stronger economic outlook, higher inflation, and a larger balance sheet and thus could warrant a potentially faster pace of policy rate normalization. They empha- sized that the decision to initiate runoff would be data dependent. Some participants commented that removing policy ac- commodation by relying more on balance sheet reduc- tion and less on increases in the policy rate could help limit yield curve flattening during policy normalization. Page 4 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ A few of these participants raised concerns that a rela- tively flat yield curve could adversely affect interest mar- gins for some financial intermediaries, which may raise financial stability risks. However, a couple of other par- ticipants referenced staff analysis and previous experi- ence in noting that many factors can affect longer-dated yields, making it difficult to judge how a different policy mix would affect the shape of the yield curve. Many participants judged that the appropriate pace of balance sheet runoff would likely be faster than it was during the previous normalization episode. Many par- ticipants also judged that monthly caps on the runoff of securities could help ensure that the pace of runoff would be measured and predictable, particularly given the shorter weighted average maturity of the Federal Re- serve’s Treasury security holdings. Participants discussed considerations regarding the longer-run size of the balance sheet consistent with the efficient and effective implementation of monetary pol- icy in an ample-reserves regime. Participants noted that the current size of the balance sheet is elevated and would likely remain so for some time after the process of normalizing the balance sheet was under way. Several participants noted that the level of reserves that would ultimately be needed to implement monetary policy ef- fectively is uncertain, because the underlying demand for reserves by banks is time varying. In light of this uncer- tainty and the Committee’s previous experience, a cou- ple of participants expressed a preference to allow for a substantial buffer level of reserves to support interest rate control. Participants noted that it would be im- portant to carefully monitor developments in money markets as the level of reserves fell to help inform the Committee’s eventual assessment of the appropriate level for the balance sheet in the longer run. Some par- ticipants expressed the view that the SRF would help en- sure interest rate control as the size of the balance sheet approached its longer-run level; several participants noted that the SRF could facilitate a faster runoff of the balance sheet than might otherwise be the case; several participants raised the possibility that the establishment of the SRF could reduce the demand for reserves in the longer run, suggesting that the longer-run balance sheet could be smaller than otherwise. Participants also discussed the composition of the Fed- eral Reserve’s asset holdings. Consistent with the previ- ous normalization principles, some participants ex- pressed a preference for the Federal Reserve’s asset holdings to consist primarily of Treasury securities in the longer run. To achieve such a composition, some par- ticipants favored reinvesting principal from agency MBS into Treasury securities relatively soon or letting agency MBS run off the balance sheet faster than Treasury se- curities. Participants welcomed additional analysis from the staff on issues related to normalization and agreed that con- tinuing their deliberations at upcoming meetings would be useful. Staff Review of the Economic Situation The information available at the time of the Decem- ber 14–15 meeting suggested that U.S. real GDP growth was picking up in the fourth quarter after having slowed in the third quarter. Labor market conditions continued to improve in October and November, and measures of compensation had risen sharply so far this year. Con- sumer price inflation through October—as measured by the 12-month percentage change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE)—remained elevated. Total nonfarm payroll employment rose solidly, on av- erage, in October and November, but the average gain was below that seen in recent quarters. The unemploy- ment rate declined from 4.8 percent in September to 4.2 percent in November; the unemployment rates for African Americans and Hispanics also declined substan- tially over this period, but both rates remained well above the national average. The labor force participa- tion rate and the employment-to-population ratio both moved up in November. Private-sector job openings, as measured by the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Sur- vey, remained well above pre-pandemic levels; quits rates also stayed elevated despite edging down in Octo- ber. The four-week moving average of initial claims for regular state unemployment insurance moved lower through early December and was at a level similar to that seen before the pandemic. Recent weekly estimates of private-sector payrolls constructed by the Board’s staff using data provided by the payroll processor ADP pointed to a further increase in private employment through early December. Average hourly earnings rose 4.8 percent over the 12 months ending in November, with sizable wage gains observed across most sectors. Inflation readings remained high, and various indicators suggested that inflationary pressures had broadened in recent months. Total PCE price inflation was 5.0 per- cent over the 12 months ending in October, and core PCE price inflation, which excludes changes in con- sumer energy prices and many consumer food prices, was 4.1 percent over the same period. The trimmed Minutes of the Meeting of December 14–15, 2021 Page 5 _____________________________________________________________________________________________ mean measure of 12-month PCE inflation constructed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas was 2.6 percent in October, an increase of 0.6 percentage point relative to two months earlier. In November, the 12-month change in the consumer price index (CPI) was 6.8 per- cent, while core CPI inflation was 4.9 percent over the same period. Survey-based measures of medium- and longer-run inflation expectations—including those from the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s Survey of Con- sumer Expectations, and the Survey of Professional Forecasters—leveled off after having risen over the past year. Real PCE growth appeared to be picking up in the fourth quarter despite an upturn in COVID-19 cases, the waning effect of previous fiscal stimulus measures, lingering supply bottlenecks, and recent increases in con- sumer prices. In particular, real expenditures on retail goods rose solidly again in October, and outlays for ser- vices strengthened. In November, however, the com- ponents of the nominal retail sales data used to estimate PCE stepped down, possibly reflecting some holiday sales having been pulled forward to October. Light mo- tor vehicle sales in October and November were below their third-quarter average (though they were up, on net, relative to September), as extremely low dealer invento- ries continued to constrain sales. Housing demand re- mained strong, but indicators of housing-sector activity, including housing starts and home sales, were generally little changed in October. Shortages of construction ma- terials appeared to have hampered building completions, and there was limited availability of lots ready for con- struction. Growth in business fixed investment appeared to be ris- ing at a slow pace again in the fourth quarter, as supply bottlenecks continued to weigh on business equipment spending, and the limited availability of construction ma- terials was still holding back spending on nonresidential structures. Manufacturing output increased in October, and availa- ble indicators of production were consistent with an- other gain in November. Motor vehicle output moved up in October from its low level in September, as most assembly plants previously shuttered by semiconductor chip shortages had reopened. Outside of motor vehi- cles, manufacturing production also rose in October, partly reflecting the continued recovery from the effects of Hurricane Ida on the output of the petrochemical, re- fining, and plastic resins industries. Total real government purchases appeared to be rising moderately again in the fourth quarter. Federal defense spending rose, on net, in October and November rela- tive to the third quarter. However, growth in state and local government purchases appeared to be moderating, as payrolls decreased in October and November, and nominal state and local construction expenditures in Oc- tober were only a little above their third-quarter level. After reaching a record level in September, the U.S. in- ternational trade deficit narrowed in October, reflecting a large rebound in exports. The export rebound was broad based, with sizable increases in real exports of in- dustrial supplies, capital goods, agricultural products, and consumer goods. Exports of automotive products also picked up after having been low in recent months. Real imports were little changed in October, with in- creases in imports of automotive products and con- sumer goods offset by a decline in industrial supplies. Shipping congestion and other bottlenecks continued to restrain overall trade in goods. Exports and imports of services edged up in October but remained low relative to pre-pandemic levels, largely because international travel was still depressed. Incoming data were consistent with a pickup in foreign economic growth in the current quarter, driven mainly by the reopening of Asian economies following lock- downs earlier in the year to contain a resurgence of COVID-19 cases. Strong gains in intra-Asian trade and solid readings of purchasing managers indexes also pro- vided some early signs that production bottlenecks in the region were easing. In contrast, the introduction of new public health restrictions in Europe in response to a new wave of COVID-19 infections appeared to have re- strained economic activity in some European econo- mies. More recently, the detection and rapid spread of the Omicron variant prompted new international travel restrictions in many foreign economies. Inflation abroad continued to rise, mostly driven by further in- creases in retail energy and food prices. In addition, cost pressures from persistent bottlenecks in supply and transportation were reflected in record-high input and output price components of the purchasing managers in- dexes. Staff Review of the Financial Situation Over the intermeeting period, rising inflation and FOMC communications appeared to have put substan- tial upward pressure on shorter-dated Treasury yields. Even so, longer-dated Treasury yields declined, on net, in part reflecting renewed concerns among market par- Page 6 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ ticipants about the course of the pandemic and associ- ated safe-haven flows. Pandemic-related fears as well as concerns about inflation and tighter monetary policy ap- parently weighed on risky asset prices despite continued robust economic data. In domestic markets, broad eq- uity price indexes were little changed, equity market vol- atility increased markedly, and spreads on corporate bonds widened moderately. In AFEs, sovereign yields declined, and major equity indexes edged down. Short- term funding markets were stable, while participation in the ON RRP facility increased further. Overall, financ- ing conditions for businesses and households remained accommodative except for small businesses and nonprime borrowers. Market participants’ views on the expected path for the federal funds rate—as implied by a straight read of over- night index swap quotes—suggested that they had pulled forward expected rate increases more into 2022 and 2023 compared with the timing they anticipated at the time of the previous FOMC meeting. The potential for a less accommodative policy stance over the next few years contributed to a notable rise in two- and five-year Treasury yields. On net, inflation compensation had declined moderately since the November FOMC meeting, as heightened con- cerns about the inflation outlook appeared to be out- weighed by increases in the perceived prospects for tighter monetary policy and by fears about the course of the pandemic. Renewed concerns about the course of the pandemic also contributed to a decline in the 10-year Treasury yield, on net, over the intermeeting period de- spite stronger-than-anticipated data on economic activ- ity and surprisingly high inflation. Broad equity indexes were little changed, on net, since the previous FOMC meeting, as strong economic data appeared to offset concerns regarding monetary policy, inflation, and the pandemic. Spreads of both invest- ment- and speculative-grade corporate bonds widened moderately, and spreads of municipal bonds were little changed. Short-term funding markets were stable over the inter- meeting period. Throughout the period, the effective federal funds rate remained at 8 basis points apart from a brief decrease on the November month-end, and the SOFR remained at 5 basis points. Participation in ON RRP operations increased slightly to an average of $1.5 trillion. Foreign asset prices fluctuated over the intermeeting pe- riod in response to central bank communications, head- lines regarding COVID-related restrictions in some countries, and the spread of the Omicron variant. On net, AFE sovereign yields declined, major foreign equity indexes generally edged down, and the broad dollar in- dex increased modestly. Emerging market economy (EME) sovereign spreads widened, and capital flows into EME-dedicated funds turned slightly negative in the second half of November, partly in response to concerns about the Omicron variant. A credit agency declared two heavily indebted Chinese property developers to be in “restricted default,” hurting asset prices in China’s real estate sector, but spillovers to broader financial markets were limited. In domestic credit markets, financing conditions for nonfinancial corporations remained accommodative. Gross corporate bond issuance by both investment- and speculative-grade borrowers was solid, and gross lever- aged loan issuance was robust. Equity raised through traditional initial public offerings also was strong, but eq- uity issuance through special purpose acquisition com- panies remained much weaker than earlier this year. In November, commercial and industrial (C&I) loans on banks’ books grew for the first time since the beginning of the year. The share of Paycheck Protection Program loans in C&I loan balances at banks continued to fall in the third quarter amid ongoing forgiveness of those loans. The credit quality of large nonfinancial corporations re- mained solid amid strong earnings growth. S&P 500 firms’ earnings reports for the third quarter again ex- ceeded analyst expectations. In November, the volume of upgrades outpaced that of downgrades for both in- vestment- and speculative-grade nonfinancial corporate bonds. Trailing default rates on corporate bonds and leveraged loans declined to close to historical lows in October and November, and market indicators of future default expectations remained benign. In the municipal bond market, issuance was robust in October and November, and financing conditions re- mained accommodative, supported by low yields. The credit quality of municipal debt continued to be stable, as the number of bond upgrades outpaced downgrades, and defaults were relatively low. Survey-based indicators suggested that credit supply conditions for small firms remained stable but tighter than before the pandemic. Small business loan origina- tions ticked down in October, likely reflecting weak loan Minutes of the Meeting of December 14–15, 2021 Page 7 _____________________________________________________________________________________________ demand as suggested by survey-based and market indi- cators. Broad measures of small businesses’ financial health improved slightly. Short- and long-term delin- quency rates on loans to small businesses remained roughly in line with their pre-pandemic levels. Financing conditions in commercial real estate (CRE) markets remained accommodative. CRE loan balances on banks’ books continued to expand at a solid pace in October and November. Issuance of commercial mort- gage-backed securities (CMBS) continued to be strong, supported by spreads of agency and non-agency CMBS that were generally at or below pre-pandemic levels. De- linquency rates on mortgages in CMBS pools continued to fall but remained elevated for loans backed by hotel and retail properties. In the residential mortgage market, financing conditions stayed accommodative, particularly for borrowers who met standard conforming loan criteria. Conditions con- tinued to ease for lower-score borrowers but remained somewhat tighter than before the pandemic. Mortgage originations for home purchases and refinances were ro- bust through November amid historically low mortgage rates. The fraction of mortgage borrowers missing pay- ments continued to decline through October. Financing conditions for consumer credit remained ac- commodative for most borrowers, especially those with higher credit scores. Conditions for nonprime consum- ers in the credit card market continued to ease from the tight levels seen earlier in the pandemic. Growth of credit card balances picked up in September and Octo- ber, and bank credit data indicated a further increase in November. Growth of auto loans outstanding slowed through October because of tepid auto sales. Use of forbearance programs for credit card and auto loans re- mained at low levels in September and October. Staff Economic Outlook The projection for U.S. consumer price inflation pre- pared by the staff for the December FOMC meeting was higher than in the November projection. The near-term outlook was revised up, reflecting faster-than-expected increases both for a broad array of consumer prices and for wages. Supply chain bottlenecks were seen as con- tinuing to put upward pressure on prices. As a result, the 12-month change in PCE prices was projected to move up further relative to October’s pace and to end the year around 5 percent. Over the following two years, the boost to consumer prices caused by supply issues was expected to partly reverse, and energy prices were projected to decline. PCE price inflation was therefore expected to step down to 2.1 percent in 2022 and to re- main there in 2023 and 2024. Projected inflation over this period was a little higher than in the previous pro- jection, as supply bottlenecks were assumed to resolve more gradually and as the salience of this year’s higher inflation readings was assumed to raise the underlying trend in inflation relative to the previous forecast. Longer-run inflation was still assumed to remain an- chored at 2 percent. The staff’s forecast for economic activity remained strong but was weaker, on net, than in the November projection. Although aggregate demand appeared to be rising sharply in the fourth quarter, the emerging surge in COVID-19 caseloads and hospitalizations was ex- pected to weigh on economic activity in the winter months. In addition, supply bottlenecks were expected to resolve more gradually than previously assumed. All told, real GDP was expected to post a sizable gain over 2021 as a whole and to rise a bit less rapidly in 2022, with the pace of growth supported by the continued reopen- ing of the economy and the resolution of supply con- straints in most sectors. With the boost from these fac- tors fading, real GDP growth was projected to step down noticeably in 2023. Given the higher forecast for inflation, the staff assumed monetary policy would be less accommodative in coming years and therefore re- vised down the medium-term forecast for GDP some- what. Even so, the level of real GDP was expected to remain well above potential throughout the projection period, and labor market conditions were projected to remain very tight. The staff continued to judge that the risks to the baseline projection for economic activity were skewed to the downside and that the risks around the inflation projec- tion were skewed to the upside. In particular, the possi- bility that COVID-19 cases could continue to rise steeply, especially if the Omicron variant proves to be vaccine resistant, was seen as an important source of downside risk to activity, while the possibility of more severe and persistent supply issues was viewed as an ad- ditional downside risk to activity and as an upside risk to inflation. Participants’ Views on Current Economic Conditions and the Economic Outlook In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, participants submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and infla- tion for each year from 2021 through 2024 and over the longer run based on their individual assessments of ap- Page 8 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ propriate monetary policy, including the path of the fed- eral funds rate. The longer-run projections represented each participant’s assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, un- der appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy. A Summary of Eco- nomic Projections was released to the public following the conclusion of the meeting. In their discussion of current economic conditions, par- ticipants noted that, with progress on vaccinations and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment had continued to strengthen. The sec- tors most adversely affected by the pandemic had im- proved in recent months but continued to be affected by COVID-19. Job gains had been solid in recent months, and the unemployment rate had declined substantially. Supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic and the reopening of the economy had continued to contribute to elevated levels of inflation. Overall finan- cial conditions remained accommodative, in part reflect- ing policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses. Par- ticipants commented that the path of the economy con- tinued to depend on the course of the virus. An easing of supply constraints was expected to support continued gains in economic activity and employment as well as a reduction in inflation. Risks to the economic outlook remained, including from new variants of the virus. Participants observed that growth of economic activity appeared to have been strong in the fourth quarter after having slowed in the third quarter, and they generally ex- pected robust growth to continue in 2022. A few partic- ipants cited healthy household balance sheets, the need for businesses to rebuild inventory, and accommodative financial conditions as factors supporting continued ro- bust growth. A couple of participants commented that business conditions appeared to be improving broadly, including in sectors providing in-person services, such as the retail, restaurant, and hotel sectors. Many partici- pants noted that the emergence of the Omicron variant made the economic outlook more uncertain; several re- marked that they did not yet see the new variant as fun- damentally altering the path of economic recovery in the United States. In their discussion of the household sector, participants generally noted that demand for consumer goods had remained strong, likely supported by accommodative fis- cal and monetary policies, increased household income as more people found jobs, increasing net worth of the household sector, and the high level of savings accumu- lated through the course of the pandemic. Participants noted that supply chain bottlenecks and la- bor shortages continued to limit businesses’ ability to meet strong demand. They judged that these challenges would likely last longer and be more widespread than previously thought. Participants generally expected global supply chain bottlenecks to persist well into next year at least. While several participants pointed to signs of incremental improvement in supply chains, a few oth- ers remarked that business contacts were experiencing deteriorating supply conditions that could be exacer- bated by the emergence of new variants of the virus. A couple of participants reported that some contacts were implementing permanent changes in their business mod- els to help weather current and future disruptions, in- cluding holding larger inventories or building domestic manufacturing capacity. Many business contacts contin- ued to experience difficulty hiring workers across all skill levels, noting the lack of qualified candidates as well. Some participants noted that businesses were offering higher wages, larger bonuses, or more flexible work ar- rangements to compete for workers. Participants judged that labor markets continued to strengthen, with the unemployment rate falling rapidly and payrolls growing at a solid pace. A few participants noted the recent decline in the unemployment rates of African Americans and Hispanics and the narrowing of the racial and ethnic gap in the prime-age employment- to-population ratio as suggesting a more inclusive labor market recovery. Some participants discussed the mod- est increase in the labor force participation rate in No- vember. A number of participants judged that a sub- stantial improvement in labor force participation would take longer than previously expected. A few others as- sessed that any further improvement in labor force par- ticipation would be quite modest. Participants cited a number of pandemic and economic factors likely de- pressing labor force participation, such as increased caregiving needs amid a shortage of workers in the care- giving industry, remaining concerns about the virus, and healthy balance sheets for households, including for those who retired early. A couple of participants cited factors that could support higher labor force participa- tion over the next few years, including waning fiscal stimulus; depleted savings, particularly for lower-income households; and the historical tendency for labor force participation to lag improvement in the labor market. Participants pointed to a number of signs that the U.S. labor market was very tight, including near-record rates Minutes of the Meeting of December 14–15, 2021 Page 9 _____________________________________________________________________________________________ of quits and job vacancies, as well as a notable pickup in wage growth. In line with the recent data showing a rise in the employment cost index, many participants re- ported District business contacts either planning or hav- ing implemented larger wage increases to retain current employees or attract new workers. Participants generally noted that they were monitoring the incoming data for signs of inflationary pressures associated with the in- creasingly tight labor market. Acknowledging that the maximum level of employment consistent with price sta- bility may evolve over time, many participants saw the U.S. economy making rapid progress toward the Com- mittee’s maximum-employment goal. Several partici- pants viewed labor market conditions as already largely consistent with maximum employment. Participants remarked that inflation readings had been higher and were more persistent and widespread than previously anticipated. Some participants noted that trimmed mean measures of inflation had reached dec- ade-high levels and that the percentage of product cate- gories with substantial price increases continued to climb. While participants generally continued to antici- pate that inflation would decline significantly over the course of 2022 as supply constraints eased, almost all stated that they had revised up their forecasts of inflation for 2022 notably, and many did so for 2023 as well. In discussing their revisions to the inflation outlook, partic- ipants pointed to rising housing costs and rents, more widespread wage growth driven by labor shortages, and more prolonged global supply-side frictions, which could be exacerbated by the emergence of the Omicron variant. Moreover, participants widely cited business contacts feeling confident that they would be able to pass on higher costs of labor and material to customers. Participants noted their continuing attention to the pub- lic’s concern about the sizable increase in the cost of liv- ing that had taken place this year and the associated bur- den on U.S. households, particularly those who had lim- ited scope to pay higher prices for essential goods and services. In their comments on inflation expectations, some par- ticipants discussed the risk that recent elevated levels of inflation could increase the public’s longer-term expec- tations for inflation to a level above that consistent with the Committee’s longer-run inflation objective. They noted that the realization of such a development could make it harder for the Committee to achieve 2 percent inflation over the longer run. A couple of participants pointed to reports of higher inflation expectations of businesses and of increased use of cost-of-living adjust- ments in wage negotiations as early developments that could potentially affect the anchoring of inflation expec- tations. A few participants, however, noted that long- term inflation expectations remained well anchored, cit- ing stable readings of market-based inflation compensa- tion measures or the generally low level of longer-term bond yields. Participants observed that uncertainty about the eco- nomic outlook remained high. Most agreed that risks to inflation were weighted to the upside. Several partici- pants pointed to the possibility that structural factors that kept inflation low in the previous decade, such as technological changes, demographics, and the proximity of the ELB in an environment of low equilibrium inter- est rates, may reemerge when the effects of the pan- demic abate. A couple of others noted the risk that per- sistent real wage growth in excess of productivity growth could trigger inflationary wage–price dynamics. Partici- pants generally continued to stress uncertainties associ- ated with the labor market—in particular, the evolution of labor force participation—and with the length of time required to resolve the supply chain situation. Many par- ticipants noted that the pandemic, particularly new vari- ants of the virus, continued to pose downside risks to economic activity and upside risks to inflation. In their consideration of the stance of monetary policy, participants reaffirmed the Federal Reserve’s commit- ment to using its full range of tools to support the U.S. economy during this challenging time, thereby promot- ing the Committee’s statutory goals of maximum em- ployment and price stability. Participants discussed the progress the economy had made toward the criteria the Committee had specified in its forward guidance for the federal funds rate. Participants agreed that the Commit- tee’s criteria of inflation rising to 2 percent and moder- ately exceeding 2 percent for some time had been more than met. All participants remarked that inflation had continued to run notably above 2 percent, reflecting sup- ply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic and the reopening of the economy. With respect to the max- imum-employment criterion, participants noted that the labor market had been making rapid progress as meas- ured by a variety of indicators, including solid job gains reported in recent months, a substantial further decline in a range of unemployment rates to levels well below those prevailing a year ago, and a labor force participa- tion rate that had recently edged up. Many participants judged that, if the current pace of improvement contin- ued, labor markets would fast approach maximum em- ployment. Several participants remarked that they viewed labor market conditions as already largely con- sistent with maximum employment. Page 10 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ In support of the Committee’s goals of maximum em- ployment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run, participants judged that it would be appro- priate for the Committee to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent until labor market conditions had reached levels consistent with the Com- mittee’s assessments of maximum employment, a condi- tion most participants judged could be met relatively soon if the recent pace of labor market improvements continued. A few participants remarked that maximum employment consistent with price stability evolves over time and that further improvements in labor markets were likely over subsequent years as the economy con- tinued to expand. Some participants also remarked that there could be circumstances in which it would be ap- propriate for the Committee to raise the target range for the federal funds rate before maximum employment had been fully achieved—for example, if the Committee judged that its employment and price-stability goals were not complementary in light of economic developments and that inflation pressures and inflation expectations were moving materially and persistently higher in a way that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s longer-run goals. In light of elevated inflation pressures and the strength- ening labor market, participants judged that the increase in policy accommodation provided by the ongoing pace of net asset purchases was no longer necessary. They remarked that a quicker conclusion of net asset pur- chases would better position the Committee to set policy to address the full range of plausible economic out- comes. Participants judged that it would be appropriate to double the pace of the ongoing reduction in net asset purchases. Such a change would result in reducing the monthly pace of net purchases of Treasury securities by $20 billion and of agency MBS by $10 billion starting in January. Participants also expected that economic con- ditions would evolve in a manner such that similar re- ductions in the pace of net asset purchases would be ap- propriate each subsequent month, resulting in an end to net asset purchases in mid-March, a few months sooner than participants had anticipated at the November FOMC meeting. In addition, participants remarked that the Committee should continue to be prepared to adjust the pace of purchases if warranted by changes in the eco- nomic outlook. Participants continued to stress that maintaining flexibil- ity to implement appropriate policy adjustments on the basis of risk-management considerations should be a guiding principle in conducting policy in the current highly uncertain environment. Participants generally noted that, given their individual outlooks for the econ- omy, the labor market, and inflation, it may become war- ranted to increase the federal funds rate sooner or at a faster pace than participants had earlier anticipated. Some participants also noted that it could be appropriate to begin to reduce the size of the Federal Reserve’s bal- ance sheet relatively soon after beginning to raise the federal funds rate. Some participants judged that a less accommodative future stance of policy would likely be warranted and that the Committee should convey a strong commitment to address elevated inflation pres- sures. These participants noted, however, that a meas- ured approach to tightening policy would help enable the Committee to assess incoming data and be in posi- tion to react to the full range of plausible economic out- comes. Committee Policy Action In their discussion of monetary policy for this meeting, members agreed that with progress on vaccinations and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment had continued to strengthen. They noted that the sectors most adversely affected by the pandemic had improved in recent months but continued to be affected by COVID-19. Job gains had been solid in recent months, and the unemployment rate had de- clined substantially. They remarked that supply and de- mand imbalances related to the pandemic and the reo- pening of the economy had continued to contribute to elevated levels of inflation. Overall financial conditions remained accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses. Members also acknowledged that the path of the economy continued to depend on the course of the virus. Progress on vac- cinations and an easing of supply constraints were ex- pected to support continued gains in economic activity and employment as well as a reduction in inflation, but risks to the economic outlook remained, including from new variants of the virus. As elevated inflation had persisted for longer than they had previously anticipated, members agreed that it was appropriate to remove the reference to “transitory” fac- tors affecting inflation in the postmeeting statement and instead note that supply and demand imbalances have continued to contribute to elevated inflation. Members also agreed that, with the emergence of the Omicron variant, it was appropriate to note the risk of new vari- ants of the virus in their assessment of risks to the eco- nomic outlook. Minutes of the Meeting of December 14–15, 2021 Page 11 _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Members agreed that the Federal Reserve was commit- ted to using its full range of tools to support the U.S. economy in this challenging time, thereby promoting its maximum employment and price stability goals. All members reaffirmed their commitment to seek to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. Members agreed that the postmeeting statement should be updated to reflect the Committee’s assessment of the progress the economy had made toward the criteria specified in its forward guidance for the target range for the federal funds rate. They agreed that the inflation cri- teria in the guidance had been met and that the postmeeting statement should note that with inflation having exceeded 2 percent for some time, the Commit- tee expected that it would be appropriate to maintain the current target range of 0 to ¼ percent until labor market conditions had reached levels consistent with the Com- mittee’s assessments of maximum employment. In light of inflation developments and the further im- provement in the labor market, members decided to re- duce the monthly pace of the Federal Reserve’s net asset purchases by $20 billion for Treasury securities and $10 billion for agency MBS. Specifically, beginning in January, the Committee would increase its holdings of Treasury securities by at least $40 billion per month and of agency MBS by at least $20 billion per month. Mem- bers also agreed that similar reductions in the pace of net asset purchases would likely be appropriate in subse- quent months, implying that increases in the Federal Re- serve’s securities holdings would cease by mid-March under the Committee’s outlook, a few months sooner than had been anticipated at the previous meeting. Members noted that the Committee was prepared to ad- just the pace of purchases if warranted by changes in the economic outlook and that it was important to maintain the flexibility to adjust the stance of policy as appropriate in response to changes in the Committee’s outlook for the labor market and inflation. Members also noted that the Federal Reserve’s ongoing asset purchases and hold- ings of securities would continue to foster smooth mar- ket functioning and accommodative financial condi- tions, thereby supporting the flow of credit. Members agreed that, in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, they would continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and that they would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate in the event that risks emerged that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals. They also concurred that, in as- sessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, they would take into account a wide range of information, in- cluding readings on public health, labor market condi- tions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Open Market Account in ac- cordance with the following domestic policy directive, for release at 2:00 p.m.: “Effective December 16, 2021, the Federal Open Market Committee directs the Desk to:  Undertake open market operations as nec- essary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of 0 to ¼ percent.  Complete the increase in System Open Market Account (SOMA) holdings of Treasury securities by $60 billion and of agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) by $30 billion, as indicated in the monthly purchase plans released in mid-December.  Increase the SOMA holdings of Treasury securities by $40 billion and of agency MBS by $20 billion, during the monthly purchase period beginning in mid-January.  Increase holdings of Treasury securities and agency MBS by additional amounts as needed to sustain smooth functioning of markets for these securities.  Conduct overnight repurchase agreement operations with a minimum bid rate of 0.25 percent and with an aggregate opera- tion limit of $500 billion; the aggregate op- eration limit can be temporarily increased at the discretion of the Chair.  Conduct overnight reverse repurchase agreement operations at an offering rate of 0.05 percent and with a per-counterparty limit of $160 billion per day; the per-counterparty limit can be temporarily increased at the discretion of the Chair.  Roll over at auction all principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of Treasury securities and reinvest all princi- pal payments from the Federal Reserve’s Page 12 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ holdings of agency debt and agency MBS in agency MBS.  Allow modest deviations from stated amounts for purchases and reinvestments, if needed for operational reasons.  Engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settle- ment of the Federal Reserve’s agency MBS transactions.” The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below for release at 2:00 p.m.: “The Federal Reserve is committed to using its full range of tools to support the U.S. economy in this challenging time, thereby promoting its maximum employment and price stability goals. With progress on vaccinations and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment have continued to strengthen. The sectors most adversely affected by the pandemic have improved in recent months but continue to be affected by COVID-19. Job gains have been solid in recent months, and the unemploy- ment rate has declined substantially. Supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic and the reopening of the economy have continued to contribute to elevated levels of inflation. Overall financial conditions remain accommo- dative, in part reflecting policy measures to sup- port the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses. The path of the economy continues to depend on the course of the virus. Progress on vaccina- tions and an easing of supply constraints are ex- pected to support continued gains in economic activity and employment as well as a reduction in inflation. Risks to the economic outlook re- main, including from new variants of the virus. The Committee seeks to achieve maximum em- ployment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. In support of these goals, the Committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent. With inflation having exceeded 2 percent for some time, the Committee expects it will be ap- propriate to maintain this target range until la- bor market conditions have reached levels con- sistent with the Committee’s assessments of maximum employment. In light of inflation de- velopments and the further improvement in the labor market, the Committee decided to reduce the monthly pace of its net asset purchases by $20 billion for Treasury securities and $10 bil- lion for agency mortgage-backed securities. Be- ginning in January, the Committee will increase its holdings of Treasury securities by at least $40 billion per month and of agency mort- gage-backed securities by at least $20 billion per month. The Committee judges that similar re- ductions in the pace of net asset purchases will likely be appropriate each month, but it is pre- pared to adjust the pace of purchases if war- ranted by changes in the economic outlook. The Federal Reserve’s ongoing purchases and holdings of securities will continue to foster smooth market functioning and accommoda- tive financial conditions, thereby supporting the flow of credit to households and businesses. In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals. The Committee’s assessments will take into account a wide range of information, in- cluding readings on public health, labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation ex- pectations, and financial and international de- velopments.” Voting for this action: Jerome H. Powell, John C. Williams, Thomas I. Barkin, Raphael W. Bostic, Michelle W. Bowman, Lael Brainard, Richard H. Clarida, Mary C. Daly, Charles L. Evans, Randal K. Quarles, and Christopher J. Waller. Voting against this action: None. Consistent with the Committee’s decision to leave the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged, the Board voted unanimously to maintain the interest rate paid on reserve balances at 0.15 percent, effective De- cember 16, 2021. The Board also voted unanimously to approve establishment of the primary credit rate at the existing level of 0.25 percent, effective December 16, 2021. Minutes of the Meeting of December 14–15, 2021 Page 13 _____________________________________________________________________________________________ At the end of the meeting, the Chair noted that the Board’s staff had made substantial progress in develop- ing formal polices to implement the tough and compre- hensive ethics rules for senior officials that were an- nounced in October. It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Tuesday–Wednesday, January 25–26, 2022. The meeting adjourned at 11:00 a.m. on Decem- ber 15, 2021.

Secretary’s note: The Federal Reserve Bank of New York subsequently sent advice that the manager selection indicated previously was sat- isfactory. By unanimous vote, the Committee voted to reaffirm without revision the Authorization for Domestic Open Market Operations as shown below. The Guidelines for the Conduct of System Open Market Operations in Fed- eral-Agency Issues remained suspended. AUTHORIZATION FOR DOMESTIC OPEN MAR- KET OPERATIONS (As reaffirmed effective January 28, 2020) OPEN MARKET TRANSACTIONS 1. The Federal Open Market Committee (the “Com- mittee”) authorizes and directs the Federal Reserve Bank selected by the Committee to execute open market trans- actions (the “Selected Bank”), to the extent necessary to carry out the most recent domestic policy directive adopted by the Committee: A. To buy or sell in the open market securities that are direct obligations of, or fully guaranteed as to prin- cipal and interest by, the United States, and securities that are direct obligations of, or fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, any agency of the United States, that are eligible for purchase or sale under Sec- tion 14(b) of the Federal Reserve Act (“Eligible Secu- rities”) for the System Open Market Account (“SOMA”): i. As an outright operation with securities dealers and foreign and international accounts maintained at the Selected Bank: on a same-day or deferred de- livery basis (including such transactions as are com- monly referred to as dollar rolls and coupon swaps) at market prices; or ii. As a temporary operation: on a same-day or deferred delivery basis, to purchase such Eligible Se- curities subject to an agreement to resell (“repo transactions”) or to sell such Eligible Securities sub- ject to an agreement to repurchase (“reverse repo transactions”) for a term of 65 business days or less, at rates that, unless otherwise authorized by the Committee, are determined by competitive bidding, _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Minutes of the Meeting of January 28–29, 2020 Page 3 after applying reasonable limitations on the volume of agreements with individual counterparties; B. To allow Eligible Securities in the SOMA to ma- ture without replacement; C. To exchange, at market prices, in connection with a Treasury auction, maturing Eligible Securities in the SOMA with the Treasury, in the case of Eligible Securities that are direct obligations of the United States or that are fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by the United States; and D. To exchange, at market prices, maturing Eligible Securities in the SOMA with an agency of the United States, in the case of Eligible Securities that are direct obligations of that agency or that are fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by that agency. SECURITIES LENDING 2. In order to ensure the effective conduct of open market operations, the Committee authorizes the Se- lected Bank to operate a program to lend Eligible Secu- rities held in the SOMA to dealers on an overnight basis (except that the Selected Bank may lend Eligible Securi- ties for longer than an overnight term to accommodate weekend, holiday, and similar trading conventions). A. Such securities lending must be: i. At rates determined by competitive bidding; ii. At a minimum lending fee consistent with the objectives of the program; iii. Subject to reasonable limitations on the total amount of a specific issue of Eligible Securities that may be auctioned; and iv. Subject to reasonable limitations on the amount of Eligible Securities that each borrower may borrow. B. The Selected Bank may: i. Reject bids that, as determined in its sole dis- cretion, could facilitate a bidder’s ability to control a single issue; ii. Accept Treasury securities or cash as collateral for any loan of securities authorized in this para- graph 2; and iii. Accept agency securities as collateral only for a loan of agency securities authorized in this para- graph 2. OPERATIONAL READINESS TESTING 3. The Committee authorizes the Selected Bank to undertake transactions of the type described in para- graphs 1 and 2 from time to time for the purpose of test- ing operational readiness, subject to the following limi- tations: A. All transactions authorized in this paragraph 3 shall be conducted with prior notice to the Commit- tee; B. The aggregate par value of the transactions au- thorized in this paragraph 3 that are of the type de- scribed in paragraph 1.A.i, 1.B, 1.C and 1.D shall not exceed $5 billion per calendar year; and C. The outstanding amount of the transactions de- scribed in paragraphs 1.A.ii and 2 shall not exceed $5 billion at any given time. TRANSACTIONS WITH CUSTOMER ACCOUNTS 4. In order to ensure the effective conduct of open market operations, while assisting in the provision of short-term investments or other authorized services for foreign central bank and international accounts main- tained at a Federal Reserve Bank (the “Foreign Ac- counts”) and accounts maintained at a Federal Reserve Bank as fiscal agent of the United States pursuant to sec- tion 15 of the Federal Reserve Act (together with the Foreign Accounts, the “Customer Accounts”), the Com- mittee authorizes the following when undertaken on terms comparable to those available in the open market: A. The Selected Bank, for the SOMA, to undertake reverse repo transactions in Eligible Securities held in the SOMA with the Customer Accounts for a term of 65 business days or less; and B. Any Federal Reserve Bank that maintains Cus- tomer Accounts, for any such Customer Account, when appropriate and subject to all other necessary authorization and approvals, to: i. Undertake repo transactions in Eligible Securi- ties with dealers with a corresponding reverse repo transaction in such Eligible Securities with the Cus- tomer Accounts; and ii. Undertake intra-day repo transactions in Eligi- ble Securities with Foreign Accounts. Transactions undertaken with Customer Accounts un- der the provisions of this paragraph 4 may provide for a service fee when appropriate. Transactions undertaken with Customer Accounts are also subject to the authori- zation or approval of other entities, including the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and, when involving accounts maintained at a Federal Reserve Bank as fiscal agent of the United States, the United States Department of the Treasury. Page 4 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ ADDITIONAL MATTERS 5. The Committee authorizes the Chairman of the Committee, in fostering the Committee’s objectives dur- ing any period between meetings of the Committee, to instruct the Selected Bank to act on behalf of the Com- mittee to: A. Adjust somewhat in exceptional circumstances the stance of monetary policy and to take actions that may result in material changes in the composition and size of the assets in the SOMA; or B. Undertake transactions with respect to Eligible Securities in order to appropriately address temporary disruptions of an operational or highly unusual nature in U.S. dollar funding markets. Any such adjustment described in subparagraph A of this paragraph 5 shall be made in the context of the Committee’s discussion and decision about the stance of policy at its most recent meeting and the Committee’s long-run objectives to foster maximum employment and price stability, and shall be based on economic, financial, and monetary developments since the most recent meet- ing of the Committee. The Chairman, whenever feasi- ble, will consult with the Committee before making any instruction under this paragraph 5. The Committee voted unanimously to reaffirm without revision the Authorization for Foreign Currency Opera- tions and the Foreign Currency Directive as shown be- low. AUTHORIZATION FOR FOREIGN CURRENCY OPERATIONS (As reaffirmed effective January 28, 2020) IN GENERAL 1. The Federal Open Market Committee (the “Com- mittee”) authorizes the Federal Reserve Bank selected by the Committee (the “Selected Bank”) to execute open market transactions for the System Open Market Ac- count as provided in this Authorization, to the extent necessary to carry out any foreign currency directive of the Committee: A. To purchase and sell foreign currencies (also known as cable transfers) at home and abroad in the open market, including with the United States Treas- ury, with foreign monetary authorities, with the Bank for International Settlements, and with other entities in the open market. This authorization to purchase and sell foreign currencies encompasses purchases and sales through standalone spot or forward transactions and through foreign exchange swap transactions. For purposes of this Authorization, foreign exchange swap transactions are: swap transactions with the United States Treasury (also known as warehousing transactions), swap transactions with other central banks under reciprocal currency arrangements, swap transactions with other central banks under standing dollar liquidity and foreign currency liquidity swap ar- rangements, and swap transactions with other entities in the open market. B. To hold balances of, and to have outstanding for- ward contracts to receive or to deliver, foreign curren- cies. 2. All transactions in foreign currencies undertaken pursuant to paragraph 1 above shall, unless otherwise authorized by the Committee, be conducted: A. In a manner consistent with the obligations re- garding exchange arrangements under Article IV of the Articles of Agreement of the International Mone- tary Fund (IMF).1 B. In close and continuous cooperation and consul- tation, as appropriate, with the United States Treasury. C. In consultation, as appropriate, with foreign monetary authorities, foreign central banks, and inter- national monetary institutions. D. At prevailing market rates. STANDALONE SPOT AND FORWARD TRANS- ACTIONS 3. For any operation that involves standalone spot or forward transactions in foreign currencies: A. Approval of such operation is required as fol- lows: i. The Committee must direct the Selected Bank in advance to execute the operation if it would result in the overall volume of standalone spot and for- ward transactions in foreign currencies, as defined in paragraph 3.C of this Authorization, exceeding $5 billion since the close of the most recent regular meeting of the Committee. The Foreign Currency Subcommittee (the “Subcommittee”) must direct the Selected Bank in advance to execute the opera- tion if the Subcommittee believes that consultation with the Committee is not feasible in the time avail- able. ii. The Committee authorizes the Subcommittee to direct the Selected Bank in advance to execute the operation if it would result in the overall volume of standalone spot and forward transactions in foreign currencies, as defined in paragraph 3.C of this Au- thorization, totaling $5 billion or less since the close _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Minutes of the Meeting of January 28–29, 2020 Page 5 of the most recent regular meeting of the Commit- tee. B. Such an operation also shall be: i. Generally directed at countering disorderly market conditions; or ii. Undertaken to adjust System balances in light of probable future needs for currencies; or iii. Conducted for such other purposes as may be determined by the Committee. C. For purposes of this Authorization, the overall volume of standalone spot and forward transactions in foreign currencies is defined as the sum (disregard- ing signs) of the dollar values of individual foreign cur- rencies purchased and sold, valued at the time of the transaction. WAREHOUSING 4. The Committee authorizes the Selected Bank, with the prior approval of the Subcommittee and at the re- quest of the United States Treasury, to conduct swap transactions with the United States Exchange Stabiliza- tion Fund established by section 10 of the Gold Reserve Act of 1934 under agreements in which the Selected Bank purchases foreign currencies from the Exchange Stabilization Fund and the Exchange Stabilization Fund repurchases the foreign currencies from the Selected Bank at a later date (such purchases and sales also known as warehousing). RECIPROCAL CURRENCY ARRANGEMENTS, AND STANDING DOLLAR AND FOREIGN CURRENCY LIQUIDITY SWAPS 5. The Committee authorizes the Selected Bank to maintain reciprocal currency arrangements established under the North American Framework Agreement, standing dollar liquidity swap arrangements, and stand- ing foreign currency liquidity swap arrangements as pro- vided in this Authorization and to the extent necessary to carry out any foreign currency directive of the Com- mittee. A. For reciprocal currency arrangements all draw- ings must be approved in advance by the Committee (or by the Subcommittee, if the Subcommittee be- lieves that consultation with the Committee is not fea- sible in the time available). B. For standing dollar liquidity swap arrangements all drawings must be approved in advance by the Chairman. The Chairman may approve a schedule of potential drawings, and may delegate to the manager, System Open Market Account, the authority to ap- prove individual drawings that occur according to the schedule approved by the Chairman. C. For standing foreign currency liquidity swap ar- rangements all drawings must be approved in advance by the Committee (or by the Subcommittee, if the Subcommittee believes that consultation with the Committee is not feasible in the time available). D. Operations involving standing dollar liquidity swap arrangements and standing foreign currency li- quidity swap arrangements shall generally be directed at countering strains in financial markets in the United States or abroad, or reducing the risk that they could emerge, so as to mitigate their effects on economic and financial conditions in the United States. E. For reciprocal currency arrangements, standing dollar liquidity swap arrangements, and standing for- eign currency liquidity swap arrangements: i. All arrangements are subject to annual review and approval by the Committee; ii. Any new arrangements must be approved by the Committee; and iii. Any changes in the terms of existing arrange- ments must be approved in advance by the Chair- man. The Chairman shall keep the Committee in- formed of any changes in terms, and the terms shall be consistent with principles discussed with and guidance provided by the Committee. OTHER OPERATIONS IN FOREIGN CURREN- CIES 6. Any other operations in foreign currencies for which governance is not otherwise specified in this Au- thorization (such as foreign exchange swap transactions with private-sector counterparties) must be authorized and directed in advance by the Committee. FOREIGN CURRENCY HOLDINGS 7. The Committee authorizes the Selected Bank to hold foreign currencies for the System Open Market Ac- count in accounts maintained at foreign central banks, the Bank for International Settlements, and such other foreign institutions as approved by the Board of Gover- nors under Section 214.5 of Regulation N, to the extent necessary to carry out any foreign currency directive of the Committee. A. The Selected Bank shall manage all holdings of foreign currencies for the System Open Market Ac- count: Page 6 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ i. Primarily, to ensure sufficient liquidity to ena- ble the Selected Bank to conduct foreign currency operations as directed by the Committee; ii. Secondarily, to maintain a high degree of safety; iii. Subject to paragraphs 7.A.i and 7.A.ii, to pro- vide the highest rate of return possible in each cur- rency; and iv. To achieve such other objectives as may be au- thorized by the Committee. B.

Purchasing and selling obligations of, or fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, a foreign government or agency thereof (“Permitted Foreign Securities”) through outright purchases and sales; ii. Purchasing Permitted Foreign Securities under agreements for repurchase of such Permitted For- eign Securities and selling such securities under agreements for the resale of such securities; and iii. Managing balances in various time and other deposit accounts at foreign institutions approved by the Board of Governors under Regulation N. C. The Subcommittee, in consultation with the Committee, may provide additional instructions to the Selected Bank regarding holdings of foreign curren- cies. ADDITIONAL MATTERS 8. The Committee authorizes the Chairman: A. With the prior approval of the Committee, to en- ter into any needed agreement or understanding with the Secretary of the United States Treasury about the division of responsibility for foreign currency opera- tions between the System and the United States Treas- ury; B. To advise the Secretary of the United States Treasury concerning System foreign currency opera- tions, and to consult with the Secretary on policy mat- ters relating to foreign currency operations; C. To designate Federal Reserve System persons au- thorized to communicate with the United States Treasury concerning System Open Market Account foreign currency operations; and D. From time to time, to transmit appropriate re- ports and information to the National Advisory Coun- cil on International Monetary and Financial Policies. 9. The Committee authorizes the Selected Bank to undertake transactions of the type described in this Au- thorization, and foreign exchange and investment transactions that it may be otherwise authorized to undertake, from time to time for the purpose of testing operational readiness. The aggregate amount of such transactions shall not exceed $2.5 billion per calendar year. These transactions shall be conducted with prior notice to the Committee. 10. All Federal Reserve banks shall participate in the foreign currency operations for System Open Market Account in accordance with paragraph 3G(1) of the Board of Governors’ Statement of Procedure with Re- spect to Foreign Relationships of Federal Reserve Banks dated January 1, 1944. 11. Any authority of the Subcommittee pursuant to this Authorization may be exercised by the Chairman if the Chairman believes that consultation with the Sub- committee is not feasible in the time available. The Chairman shall promptly report to the Subcommittee any action approved by the Chairman pursuant to this paragraph. 12. The Committee authorizes the Chairman, in excep- tional circumstances where it would not be feasible to convene the Committee, to foster the Committee’s ob- jectives by instructing the Selected Bank to engage in foreign currency operations not otherwise authorized pursuant to this Authorization. Any such action shall be made in the context of the Committee’s discussion and decisions regarding foreign currency operations. The Chairman, whenever feasible, will consult with the Com- mittee before making any instruction under this para- graph. __________________________ 1 In general, as specified in Article IV, each member of the IMF undertakes to collaborate with the IMF and other mem- bers to assure orderly exchange arrangements and to promote a stable system of exchange rates.

FOREIGN CURRENCY DIRECTIVE (As reaffirmed effective January 28, 2020) 1. The Committee directs the Federal Reserve Bank selected by the Committee (the “Selected Bank”) to ex- ecute open market transactions, for the System Open Market Account, in accordance with the provisions of the Authorization for Foreign Currency Operations (the “Authorization”) and subject to the limits in this Di- rective. _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Minutes of the Meeting of January 28–29, 2020 Page 7 2. The Committee directs the Selected Bank to exe- cute warehousing transactions, if so requested by the United States Treasury and if approved by the Foreign Currency Subcommittee (the “Subcommittee”), subject to the limitation that the outstanding balance of United States dollars provided to the United States Treasury as a result of these transactions not at any time exceed $5 billion. 3. The Committee directs the Selected Bank to main- tain, for the System Open Market Account: A. Reciprocal currency arrangements with the fol- lowing foreign central banks: Foreign central bank Maximum amount (millions of dollars or equivalent) Bank of Canada 2,000 Bank of Mexico 3,000 B. Standing dollar liquidity swap arrangements with the following foreign central banks: Bank of Canada Bank of England Bank of Japan European Central Bank Swiss National Bank C. Standing foreign currency liquidity swap arrange- ments with the following foreign central banks: Bank of Canada Bank of England Bank of Japan European Central Bank Swiss National Bank 4. The Committee directs the Selected Bank to hold and to invest foreign currencies in the portfolio in ac- cordance with the provisions of paragraph 7 of the Au- thorization. 5. The Committee directs the Selected Bank to report to the Committee, at each regular meeting of the Com- mittee, on transactions undertaken pursuant to para- graphs 1 and 6 of the Authorization. The Selected Bank is also directed to provide quarterly reports to the Com- mittee regarding the management of the foreign cur- rency holdings pursuant to paragraph 7 of the Authori- zation. 6. The Committee directs the Selected Bank to con- duct testing of transactions for the purpose of opera- tional readiness in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 9 of the Authorization. By unanimous vote, the Committee amended its Pro- gram for Security of FOMC Information (Program) with three sets of changes, effective February 1, 2020. These changes consisted of (1) an update to the rules for eligi- bility for access to FOMC information to reflect two new policies approved by the Board; (2) the addition of references to existing Federal Reserve polices that help safeguard FOMC information; and (3) organizational and technical changes to improve the consistency and accuracy of Program language. By unanimous vote, the Committee provided approval for the publication of a Federal Register notice of proposed rulemaking that seeks public comment on minor and technical updates to the FOMC Rules Regarding Avail- ability of Information, which are the Committee’s Free- dom of Information Act rules. Review of Monetary Policy Strategy, Tools, and Communication Practices Participants continued their discussion related to the on- going review of the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy strategy, tools, and communication practices. At this meeting, the discussion focused on two topics: the po- tential interactions between monetary policy and finan- cial stability and the potential use of inflation ranges around the Committee’s 2 percent inflation objective. The staff briefing on the first topic noted that in the cur- rent environment of low neutral rates, achieving the Committee’s dual-mandate goals of maximum employ- ment and price stability would require low policy rates frequently, regardless of the monetary policy strategy and tools chosen. Consequently, policy strategies and tools that help support a stronger economy and anchor inflation expectations at a level consistent with the Com- mittee’s objective in a low-neutral-rate environment can help promote financial stability. In addition, the staff reported that the available empirical evidence suggests that the effects of changes in policy rates on asset prices and risk premiums tend to be modest relative to the his- torical fluctuations in those measures. However, there may be circumstances in which a persistently accommo- dative policy stance that is otherwise consistent with the dual-mandate goals may contribute to an increase in fi- nancial system vulnerabilities, including through in- creased borrowing, financial leverage, and valuation pressures. The staff noted that clear communications of Page 8 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ the Committee’s ongoing assessments of the interac- tions between monetary policy and financial stability could help avoid large interest rate surprises that could otherwise contribute to financial vulnerabilities. The briefing concluded with a short review of how other cen- tral banks have approached this issue, including the use of financial instability escape clauses to provide leeway for the central bank to deviate from its usual monetary policy strategy if financial vulnerabilities become signifi- cant. In their discussion of the effects that alternative mone- tary policy strategies and tools might have on financial stability, participants noted that macroeconomic stability and the achievement of the Committee’s dual mandate depended on a stable financial system. An unstable fi- nancial system may amplify shocks to the economy and exacerbate increases in unemployment or drive inflation further away from the Committee’s goal. With respect to the relationship between monetary policy and finan- cial stability, some participants noted that evidence re- garding the link between the policy stance and elevated financial vulnerabilities was limited, with a couple of par- ticipants further observing that there were not many ep- isodes of persistently low interest rates. In addition, some past episodes of heightened financial vulnerabili- ties were associated with excessive risk-taking behavior that did not seem to be very responsive to typical changes in interest rates. A number of participants judged that, under some circumstances, low policy rates might help foster financial stability provided they are needed to support strong economic conditions and price stability. Some participants remarked, however, that keeping policy rates low to achieve both of the Commit- tee’s dual-mandate objectives may contribute to a buildup of financial vulnerabilities, especially at times when the economy is at or above full employment, a de- velopment that could pose future risks to the economy and to the ability of the Committee to achieve its dual mandate. Participants discussed how financial stability considera- tions should be incorporated in the conduct of monetary policy. They generally agreed that supervisory, regula- tory, and macroprudential tools should be the primary means to address financial stability risks. A few partici- pants commented that this is especially the case when addressing risks associated with structural features such as the current low level of neutral interest rates. A num- ber of participants noted that countercyclical macropru- dential tools, such as the countercyclical capital buffer, could be used to address cyclical financial stability risks. However, various participants noted that while these tools could be deployed proactively to lean against the buildup of financial vulnerabilities, they have some limi- tations in the context of the U.S. financial system, where the few available tools are, for the most part, not de- signed to address vulnerabilities outside the banking sec- tor. In addition, these tools are not within the authority of the Committee, and their use requires coordination with other prudential regulators. Recognizing these lim- itations, many participants remarked that the Committee should not rule out the possibility of adjusting the stance of monetary policy to mitigate financial stability risks, particularly when those risks have important implica- tions for the economic outlook and when macropruden- tial tools had been or were likely to be ineffective at mit- igating those risks. Nevertheless, many participants noted that the current knowledge of the interactions be- tween the stance of monetary policy and financial vul- nerabilities is too imprecise to warrant systematically ad- justing monetary policy in response to the evolution of financial stability risks. As a result, monetary policy should be guided primarily by the outlook for employ- ment and inflation, and it should respond to financial stability risks only insofar as such risks significantly threaten the achievement of the Committee’s mandate. Several participants observed that the monetary policy measures needed to curb financial stability risks could be quite large, and the resulting effects on employment and inflation could place a high hurdle for such measures. Some participants remarked that, because financial sta- bility risks are a consideration for achieving the Commit- tee’s dual mandate, a clear communications strategy would be needed to convey the Committee’s assess- ments of financial vulnerabilities and their potential im- plications for the monetary policy outlook. Several par- ticipants noted that a communications strategy could in- clude the possible use of financial instability escape clauses to help explain the rationale for policy actions when a buildup of financial vulnerabilities poses risks to the achievement of the Committee’s goals. The staff’s briefing on considerations regarding the use of an inflation range focused on three different concepts of an inflation range. First, an uncertainty range could communicate the magnitude of the inherent variability of inflation that would still be consistent with achieving the Committee’s symmetric inflation objective. Second, an operational range could signal that, under some condi- tions, the Committee would prefer inflation to be away from its longer-run objective for a time; such a range could potentially be used as part of a makeup policy strategy, including one based on average inflation target- ing, or in other strategies aimed at offsetting the adverse _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Minutes of the Meeting of January 28–29, 2020 Page 9 effects of a binding effective lower bound on policy rates. Third, an indifference range could communicate that monetary policy would not respond to deviations of in- flation within that range. The briefing also summarized the experiences of foreign central banks that use infla- tion ranges; these ranges were typically put in place many years ago, often in conjunction with adopting an infla- tion target. The staff highlighted the communications challenges that could arise if an inflation range were in- troduced at a time when inflation had been running be- low the central bank’s objective for a number of years. In this environment, the introduction of a symmetric range around the point objective could be misinter- preted as a sign that the central bank was not concerned about inflation remaining below its stated goal, a situa- tion that could lead to inflation expectations drifting down to the lower end of the range. Participants expressed a range of views on the potential benefits and costs of different types of inflation ranges. Most participants expressed concern that introducing a symmetric inflation range around the 2 percent objective following an extended period of inflation mostly running somewhat below 2 percent could be misperceived as a signal that the Committee was comfortable with contin- ued misses below its symmetric inflation objective. Many participants agreed that an uncertainty range could be misinterpreted as an indifference range and hence as a lack of commitment by the Committee to its symmet- ric 2 percent inflation objective. Some participants sug- gested that it was not clear that introducing a range would help much in achieving the Committee’s inflation objective; they noted that introducing a range could make that objective less clear to the public. Instead of establishing a range, the Committee could continue to communicate that its inflation objective was symmetric around 2 percent. While inflation is inherently variable, the Committee then could emphasize its intention for inflation to be centered on the 2 percent objective. Nev- ertheless, in view of the inherent variability of inflation, several participants judged that there could be some ben- efit in communicating the inflation objective with a sym- metric range around the point target. In addition, a few participants suggested that an inflation range could con- vey the uncertainty associated with the available array of inflation measures or that the Committee’s communica- tions could more explicitly reference other measures of inflation. Several participants also stated that employing an asymmetric operational range for a time—with 2 per- cent being at or near the lower end of that range—while still maintaining the longer-run target of 2 percent could help communicate that the Committee intended infla- tion to average 2 percent over time, which in turn could help keep longer-run inflation expectations at levels con- sistent with its objective. Participants expected that, at upcoming meetings, they would continue their deliberations on the Committee’s review of monetary policy strategy, tools, and communi- cation practices. Participants continued to anticipate that the review will likely be completed around the mid- dle of this year. Developments in Financial Markets and Open Mar- ket Operations The SOMA manager reviewed developments in financial markets over the intermeeting period. For most of the period, risk asset prices rose as market participants fo- cused on a perceived reduction in downside risks to the economic outlook, favorable data on foreign economic activity, and expectations of continued monetary policy accommodation in the United States and other major economies. Some market participants suggested that the Federal Reserve’s actions in the fourth quarter to main- tain ample reserve levels might have contributed to some degree to the rise in equity and other risk asset prices. Over the final few days of the intermeeting period, fi- nancial markets responded to news of the spread of the coronavirus that started in China, which reportedly con- tributed to downward moves in Treasury yields and, to a lesser extent, U.S. equity prices. On balance, U.S. fi- nancial conditions became more accommodative over the intermeeting period, with equity prices rising nota- bly. Despite signs of reduced risks to the outlook and of some stabilization in economic activity abroad, financial market participants’ views on the likely course of U.S. monetary policy appeared to have changed little over the intermeeting period. Market-based indicators continued to point to expectations that the target range for the fed- eral funds rate will be lowered by roughly 30 basis points this year. This was consistent with responses to the Open Market Desk’s survey, which continued to indi- cate that, while market participants viewed no change this year in the target range as the most likely outcome, they placed a higher probability on a reduction in the target range over the year than on an increase. Market commentary attributed the stability in federal funds rate expectations despite the perceived reduction in down- side risks partly to the Committee’s communications; some market participants reportedly regarded those communications as signaling a relatively high bar for changes to the target range. In addition, results from the Page 10 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Desk’s surveys suggested that, notwithstanding the abatement in some risks over recent months, many mar- ket participants continued to see risks to the economic outlook as skewed to the downside. The manager turned next to a review of money market developments and Desk operations. The federal funds rate was stable over the year-end date and remained close to the interest on excess reserves (IOER) rate. On- going reserve management purchases of Treasury bills and the Desk’s repurchase agreement (repo) operations kept aggregate reserves above the level that prevailed in early September, contributing to relatively calm money market conditions around year-end. Market participants cited funding from the additional longer-term repo op- erations spanning year-end and increased capacity in daily operations as helping to maintain stable conditions in short-term funding markets. In addition, market par- ticipants prepared earlier than usual for year-end, with borrowers increasing their term borrowing from private lenders and lenders apparently expanding their lending capacity. Since year-end, money market rates remained stable, with the Desk’s longer-term repos maturing with no dis- cernible effect on market conditions and reserve man- agement purchases of Treasury bills proceeding smoothly. At the current pace of $60 billion per month, the staff’s estimates suggested that after April of this year, the Desk’s reserve management purchases will re- store the permanent base of reserves to levels above those prevailing in early September 2019. Although re- serves are projected to be above $1.5 trillion before April, a surge in the Treasury General Account balance during the April tax season is expected to briefly reduce reserve levels and, in the absence of repo operations, bring reserves down temporarily to around $1.5 trillion. The manager discussed a potential plan for gradually transitioning to an operational approach designed to maintain ample reserve levels without the active use of repo operations to supply reserves. Under this plan, repo operations would be maintained at least through April to ensure ample reserve conditions. However, the Desk would continue the gradual reduction and consol- idation of its repo offerings ahead of April, with the plan of phasing out term repo operations after April. As part of this transition, the minimum bid rate on repo opera- tions could be gradually lifted, and the Committee could consider whether there is a role for repo operations in the implementation framework. In the second quarter, the manager expected reserve conditions to support slowing the pace of Treasury bill purchases, with the goal of eventually aligning growth of the Federal Reserve’s Treasury holdings with trend growth in its liabilities. As that time approaches, the Committee might wish to consider the appropriate ma- turity composition of reserve management purchases of Treasury securities. The manager noted that, although the pace of Treasury purchases would likely continue into the second quarter, the rate of expansion in the Fed- eral Reserve’s balance sheet would moderate during the first half of 2020 as repo outstanding was gradually re- duced. The manager’s briefing addressed the possibility of a small technical adjustment to the Federal Reserve’s ad- ministered rates in light of the stability in money market conditions over recent months. With this adjustment, the Board would lift the interest rates on required and excess reserves by 5 basis points, and the FOMC would implement an equal-sized upward adjustment to the overnight reverse repurchase agreement offer rate. This technical adjustment would reverse the small downward adjustment to administered rates made in September, when money markets were volatile. By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk’s domestic transactions over the intermeeting period. No intervention operations occurred in foreign currencies for the System’s account during the intermeeting period. Staff Review of the Economic Situation The information available for the January 28–29 meeting indicated that labor market conditions remained strong and that real gross domestic product (GDP) increased at a moderate rate in the fourth quarter of 2019. Consumer price inflation, as measured by the 12-month percentage change in the price index for personal consumption ex- penditures (PCE), remained below 2 percent in Novem- ber. Survey-based measures of longer-run inflation ex- pectations were little changed. Total nonfarm payroll employment rose in December, and the solid pace of job gains over the second half of 2019 was somewhat above that for the first half. How- ever, the rate of increase in payrolls in 2019 was slower than in 2018, whether or not one accounted for the an- ticipated effects of the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ bench- mark revision to payroll employment, which was sched- uled for early February. The unemployment rate held steady at its 50-year low of 3.5 percent in December, and the labor force participation rate and the employment- to-population ratio were unchanged as well. The unem- ployment rates for African Americans, Asians, Hispan- ics, and whites were below their levels at the end of the _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Minutes of the Meeting of January 28–29, 2020 Page 11 previous economic expansion. Although persistent dif- ferentials between these rates remained, they have gen- erally narrowed during the expansion. The average share of workers employed part time for economic reasons in November stayed below its level in late 2007. The rate of private-sector job openings declined, on net, in Octo- ber and November but was still at a fairly high level; the rate of quits, which was also at a high level, edged up. The four-week moving average of initial claims for un- employment insurance benefits through mid-January re- mained near historically low levels. Nominal wage growth was moderate, with average hourly earnings for all employees increasing 2.9 percent over the 12 months ending in December. Total consumer prices, as measured by the PCE price index, increased 1.5 percent over the 12 months ending in November. Core PCE price inflation (which excludes changes in consumer food and energy prices) was 1.6 percent over that same 12-month period. Consumer food price inflation was lower than core inflation, and consumer energy prices declined. The trimmed mean measure of 12-month PCE price inflation constructed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas remained at 2 per- cent in November. The consumer price index (CPI) and the core CPI both rose 2.3 percent over the 12 months ending in December. Recent readings on survey-based measures of longer-run inflation expectations were little changed, on balance, in recent months. The University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers’ measure for the next 5 to 10 years moved back up in early January after having fallen to its lowest value on record in December. Mean- while, the 3-year-ahead measure from the Federal Re- serve Bank of New York’s Survey of Consumer Expec- tations remained near its historical low in December. Real PCE appeared to have risen more slowly in the fourth quarter than in the third quarter. Retail sales were soft during the fourth quarter, and sales of light motor vehicles declined in December after a strong gain in No- vember. However, key factors that influence consumer spending—including the low unemployment rate, the upward trend in real disposable income, high levels of households’ net worth, and generally low interest rates— remained supportive of solid real PCE growth in the near term. In addition, recent readings on consumer confidence from both the University of Michigan and the Conference Board surveys were strong. Real residential investment appeared to have increased solidly again in the fourth quarter. Starts for single-fam- ily homes increased sharply over the November and De- cember period, building permit issuance for such homes rose on net, and starts of multifamily units also moved up. Existing home sales increased, on balance, in No- vember and December, while new home sales declined. All told, the data on residential construction and sales continued to suggest that the decline in mortgage rates since late 2018 had been boosting housing activity. The available data pointed to another decline in real non- residential private fixed investment in the fourth quarter, with a further contraction in structures investment more than offsetting a modest rise in investment in equipment and intangibles. Nominal shipments and new orders of nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft were little changed in the fourth quarter. Although some measures of business sentiment improved, analysts’ expectations of firms’ longer-term profit growth edged down further, concerns about trade developments continued to weigh on firms’ investment decisions, and reduced deliveries of the Boeing 737 Max were likely restraining investment. Nominal business expenditures for nonresidential struc- tures outside of the drilling and mining sector continued to decline in November. The total number of crude oil and natural gas rigs in operation—an indicator of busi- ness spending for structures in the drilling and mining sector—was little changed, on net, through mid-January, though still below levels seen over the latter part of 2019. Industrial production (IP) increased, on net, in Novem- ber and December, partly because of a pickup in motor vehicle production following the strike at General Mo- tors. Even so, IP was lower than a year earlier, with de- clines in manufacturing production and the output of utilities only partly offset by an increase in mining out- put. Automakers’ schedules suggested that assemblies of light motor vehicles would increase in the first quar- ter, but that gain appeared likely to be offset by Boeing’s curtailed production of the 737 Max aircraft and, more generally, by mixed readings on new orders from na- tional and regional manufacturing surveys. Total real government purchases appeared to have in- creased moderately in the fourth quarter. Nominal de- fense spending in November and December pointed to only a moderate rise in real federal government pur- chases. Real purchases by state and local governments looked to have risen a little faster than in the third quar- ter; nominal construction spending by these govern- ments increased solidly in November, and state and local payrolls expanded modestly in December. Real net exports were estimated to have provided a sub- stantial boost to real GDP growth in the fourth quarter. Page 12 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Available monthly data suggested that imports fell sig- nificantly, led by declines in consumer goods and auto- mobiles, while exports were about flat. Incoming data suggested that foreign economic growth slowed further in the fourth quarter to a very subdued pace. In the advanced foreign economies (AFEs), growth appeared to have remained weak as the manu- facturing slump continued and a consumption tax hike in Japan led to a sharp contraction in household spend- ing. In the emerging economies, social unrest weighed heavily on economic activity in Hong Kong and Chile, while the labor strike at General Motors was a further drag on Mexico’s already weak economy. In contrast, early GDP releases showed a pickup in growth in China and some other Asian economies, though news of the coronavirus outbreak raised questions about the sustain- ability of that pickup. Foreign inflation rose in the wake of temporary factors in India and China, while it re- mained soft in most AFEs, in part reflecting previous declines in energy prices and muted core inflation pres- sures. Staff Review of the Financial Situation Investor sentiment improved, on balance, over the inter- meeting period, mostly reflecting progress related to the phase-one trade deal between the United States and China and its subsequent signing, the perception that the probability of a disorderly Brexit had declined, signs of stabilization in the global economic outlook, and, report- edly, continued confidence that monetary policy in the United States and other major economies would remain accommodative in the near term. Late in the period, concerns about the spread of the coronavirus and uncer- tainty about its potential economic effect weighed nega- tively on investor sentiment and led to moderate declines in the prices of risky assets. On net, equity prices in- creased notably over the intermeeting period, while cor- porate bond spreads were little changed and yields on nominal Treasury securities declined. Financing condi- tions for businesses and households eased a bit further and generally remained supportive of spending and eco- nomic activity. Federal Reserve communications over the intermeeting period reportedly reinforced investors’ beliefs that a near-term change to the target range for the federal funds rate was unlikely. Consistent with those reports, a straight read of the probability distributions for the fed- eral funds rate implied by options prices suggested that investors assigned a high probability to the target range remaining unchanged over the next few months. Expec- tations for the federal funds rate at the end of 2020, as implied by overnight index swap quotes, moved down slightly, on net, and implied about a 30 basis point de- cline in the federal funds rate from its current level. Yields on nominal Treasury securities declined, on net, across the maturity spectrum over the intermeeting pe- riod, while the spread between the yields on nominal 10- and 2-year Treasury securities was little changed. Measures of inflation compensation over the next 5 years and 5 to 10 years ahead based on Treasury Infla- tion-Protected Securities decreased, on net, but re- mained above their October 2019 lows. Broad stock price indexes increased notably, on balance, over the intermeeting period, with gains largely at- tributed to improved market sentiment about trade ne- gotiations and a perceived lower probability of a disor- derly Brexit. Late in the period, equity prices retraced some of their gains, as concerns about the spread of the coronavirus weighed negatively on risk sentiment. Overall movements in stock prices varied widely across economic sectors, with stocks of firms in the infor- mation technology and utilities sectors significantly out- performing aggregate indexes, while stock prices of firms in the energy sector declined markedly. Option- implied volatility on the S&P 500 index increased a bit, on balance, while corporate credit spreads were little changed. Conditions in domestic short-term funding markets, in- cluding in secured financing, were stable over the inter- meeting period, even over year-end. Rates declined slightly, likely reflecting increased liquidity and a higher level of reserves provided by the Desk’s open market operations. The effective federal funds rate remained close to the IOER rate, and spreads for term unsecured commercial paper and negotiable certificates of deposit narrowed substantially, particularly after year-end. The Desk’s open market operations proceeded smoothly. For most of the intermeeting period, foreign equity prices rose amid progress on U.S.–China trade negotia- tions, generally favorable data on global economic activ- ity, and the reduced risk of a disorderly Brexit following the U.K. general election. Late in the period, however, concerns about the coronavirus outbreak in China weighed on risk sentiment. On balance, most major for- eign equity indexes increased modestly, and AFE long- term sovereign yields ended the period somewhat lower. U.K. and Canadian yields declined more than elsewhere against the backdrop of central bank communications that were interpreted as increasing the likelihood of pol- icy easing in those countries. _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Minutes of the Meeting of January 28–29, 2020 Page 13 The broad dollar index weakened slightly over the pe- riod, predominantly against emerging market currencies. The Chinese renminbi appreciated notably against the dollar on positive trade policy developments, but this gain was more than undone late in the period by con- cerns about the coronavirus. The Mexican peso strengthened against the dollar, supported by progress on the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) and Bank of Mexico communications that were perceived as less accommodative than expected. Financing conditions for nonfinancial firms remained accommodative, on balance, with corporate borrowing costs staying near historical lows during the intermeeting period. Gross issuance of investment-grade corporate bonds was subdued in January and December after surg- ing in November. Issuance of speculative-grade bonds over the intermeeting period remained about in line with the average pace over December and January in recent years. Institutional leveraged loan issuance continued to be robust in December, reflecting solid refinancing ac- tivity and moderate new money issuance. Meanwhile, commercial and industrial (C&I) loans on banks’ balance sheets contracted in the fourth quarter. Respondents to the January 2020 Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices (SLOOS) reported that bor- rower demand weakened for C&I loans over the fourth quarter, and lending standards on such loans were little changed. Gross equity issuance through seasoned offer- ings remained robust in December, while initial public offerings continued to be quite light. The credit quality of nonfinancial corporations and the earnings outlook remained generally stable in recent months. Credit con- ditions for both small businesses and municipalities re- mained accommodative on net. In the commercial real estate (CRE) sector, financing conditions also remained generally accommodative. The volume of agency and non-agency commercial mort- gage-backed securities issuance grew notably in the fourth quarter, buoyed by lower interest rates, and the growth of CRE loans on banks’ books picked up over this period. Responses to the January 2020 SLOOS sug- gested that lending standards and demand for most CRE loan categories were unchanged in the fourth quarter. Financing conditions in the residential mortgage market remained accommodative on balance. Mortgage rates decreased notably during the intermeeting period, reach- ing recent-year lows. Home-purchase originations re- mained around post-crisis highs, and mortgage refinanc- ing activity continued at a strong pace through Decem- ber. Financing conditions in consumer credit markets re- mained supportive of growth in consumer spending, al- though the supply of credit remained relatively tight for nonprime borrowers. The growth of credit card bal- ances slowed in the fourth quarter, and, according to the January SLOOS, commercial banks tightened their standards on credit card loans over this period. Auto loan growth maintained a solid pace in recent months amid declining interest rates through year-end. The staff provided an update on its assessments of po- tential risks to financial stability. On balance, the finan- cial vulnerabilities of the U.S. financial system were char- acterized as moderate. The staff judged that asset valu- ation pressures had increased in recent months to an el- evated level. Asset valuation pressures were character- ized as fairly widespread across a number of markets, similar to the situation in much of 2017 and 2018. In assessing vulnerabilities stemming from borrowing in the household and business sectors, the staff noted that, while the ratio of household debt to nominal GDP was fairly low, the ratio of business debt to nominal GDP was high by historical standards. At the same time, ma- jor financial institutions were viewed as resilient, in part because of high levels of capital at banks. Nonetheless, the staff noted that banks had announced that they in- tend to allow their capital ratios to decline closer to reg- ulatory requirements over the medium term. Vulnera- bilities stemming from funding risk were characterized as moderate. While the money market strains in Sep- tember raised some questions about vulnerabilities in funding markets, the staff assessed that the core of the financial system remains resilient to vulnerabilities from maturity and liquidity transformation. Staff Economic Outlook The projection for U.S. real GDP growth prepared by the staff for the January FOMC meeting was stronger than in the previous forecast. Data pertaining to the fourth quarter of 2019, particularly on imports, sug- gested output rose faster at the end of the year than was previously projected, and this faster pace seemed con- sistent with the solid employment gains in the fourth quarter. In addition, more supportive financial condi- tions and the anticipated effects of the phase-one trade deal between the United States and China pushed up the staff’s GDP forecast for this year and next. All told, real GDP growth was projected to be about the same in 2020 as in 2019 and then to slow modestly in the coming years, partly because of a fading boost from fiscal policy. Output was forecast to expand at a rate a little above the staff’s estimate of its potential rate of growth in 2020 and 2021 and then to slow to a pace slightly below potential Page 14 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ output growth in 2022. The unemployment rate was projected to decline a little further this year and to re- main at that lower level through 2022; the unemploy- ment rate was anticipated to be below the staff’s estimate of its longer-run natural rate throughout the forecast pe- riod. The staff’s forecasts for both total and core PCE price inflation over the 2020–22 period were essentially unre- vised. Core inflation was still projected to step up a little in 2020 but to run a bit below 2 percent both this year and over the next two years. Total PCE price inflation was projected to be a little lower than core inflation in 2020 because of a projected decline in consumer energy prices and to be the same as core inflation in 2021 and 2022. The staff continued to view the uncertainty around its projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as generally similar to the average of the past 20 years. The staff viewed the downside risks to economic activity as having diminished a bit further since the previous forecast but still judged that the risks to the forecast for real GDP growth were tilted to the downside, with a corresponding skew to the upside for the unemployment rate. Important factors influencing this assessment were that foreign economic and geopo- litical developments still seemed more likely to move in directions that could have significant negative effects on the U.S. economy than to resolve more favorably than assumed. In addition, softness in business investment and manufacturing production last year, as well as the recent weakness in imports, was seen as pointing to the possibility of a more substantial slowing in economic growth than the staff projected. The risks to the infla- tion projection were also viewed as having a downward skew, in part because of the downside risks to the fore- cast for economic activity. Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook Participants agreed that the labor market had remained strong over the intermeeting period and that economic activity had risen at a moderate rate. Job gains had been solid, on average, in recent months, and the unemploy- ment rate had remained low. Although household spending had risen at a moderate pace, business fixed investment and exports had remained weak. On a 12-month basis, overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy were running below 2 per- cent. Market-based measures of inflation compensation remained low; survey-based measures of longer-term in- flation expectations were little changed. Participants generally judged that the current stance of monetary policy was appropriate to support sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation returning to the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent objective. They expected economic growth to continue at a moderate pace, supported by ac- commodative monetary and financial conditions. In ad- dition, some trade uncertainties had diminished recently, and there were some signs of stabilization in global growth. Nonetheless, uncertainties about the outlook remained, including those posed by the outbreak of the coronavirus. In their discussion of the household sector, participants noted that spending growth had moderated in the fourth quarter. However, they generally expected that, in the period ahead, consumption spending would likely re- main on a firm footing, supported by strong labor mar- ket conditions, rising incomes, and healthy household balance sheets. Some participants noted the upbeat tone of consumer surveys, and a few commented that their District contacts had reported solid retail sales during the holiday shopping season. In addition, many partici- pants were encouraged by the significant pickup since last summer in residential investment, a development that reflected, in part, the effects of lower mortgage rates. With respect to the business sector, participants ob- served that business investment and exports remained weak and that manufacturing output had declined over the past year. Looking ahead, participants were generally cautiously optimistic about the effects on the business sector of the recent favorable trade developments and the signs of stabilization in global growth. Many partic- ipants expressed the view that these developments might boost business confidence or raise export demand, which would help strengthen or at least stabilize business investment. A few participants remarked that contacts in their Districts had noted that business sentiment was brighter or that companies were intending to expand their capital expenditures this year. Several other partic- ipants, however, judged that the effect of the recent trade agreement with China would be relatively limited, as trade uncertainty would likely remain elevated, with the possibility remaining of the emergence of new ten- sions as well as the reescalation of existing tensions. They noted that the agreement would still leave a large portion of tariffs in place and that many firms had al- ready been making production and supply chain adjust- ments in response to trade tensions. _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Minutes of the Meeting of January 28–29, 2020 Page 15 Participants also commented on ongoing challenges fac- ing the energy and agriculture sectors. A couple of par- ticipants remarked that activity in the energy sector con- tinued to be weak, and a few noted that financial condi- tions in the agricultural sector would likely remain chal- lenging for many despite farm subsidies from the federal government and recent optimism surrounding trade prospects. Participants judged that conditions in the labor market remained strong, with the unemployment rate at a 50-year low and continued solid job gains, on average. Although the upcoming annual benchmark revision was expected to reduce estimates of recent payroll growth, participants expected payroll employment to expand at a healthy pace this year. Business contacts in many Dis- tricts indicated continued strong labor demand, with several participants mentioning that contacts reported difficulties in finding qualified workers or that observed wage growth might currently understate the degree of tightness in the labor market. However, a number of participants indicated that aggregate measures of nomi- nal wages continued to rise at a moderate pace broadly in line with productivity growth and the rate of inflation. Several participants commented on potential reasons for the absence of stronger broad-based wage pressures, in- cluding technological changes that could substitute for labor, increased willingness of employees to forgo wage gains for greater job stability, adjustments in nonwage portions of compensation packages, and the possibility that the labor market was not as tight as the historically low unemployment rate would suggest. Many partici- pants pointed to the strong performance of labor force participation despite the downward pressures associated with an aging population, and several raised the possibil- ity that there was some room for labor force participa- tion to rise further. In their discussion of inflation developments, partici- pants noted that recent readings on overall and core PCE price inflation, measured on a 12-month basis, had continued to run below 2 percent. Overall, participants described their inflation outlook as having changed little since December. Participants generally expected infla- tion to move closer to 2 percent in the coming months as the unusually low readings in early 2019 drop out of the 12-month calculation. Participants also expected that, as the economic expansion continues and resource utilization remains high, inflation would return to the 2 percent objective on a sustainable basis. A few partic- ipants expressed less confidence in this outlook for in- flation and commented that inflation had averaged less than 2 percent over the past several years even as re- source utilization had increased, or pointed to down- ward pressures from global or technology-related factors that could continue to suppress inflation. A couple of participants, however, noted that some alternative infla- tion indicators, including trimmed mean measures, sug- gested that there had been a modest step-up in underly- ing inflation during 2019 or that underlying inflation could already be at a level consistent with the Commit- tee’s goal. Participants generally saw the distribution of risks to the outlook for economic activity as somewhat more favor- able than at the previous meeting, although a number of downside risks remained prominent. The easing of trade tensions resulting from the recent agreement with China and the passage of the USMCA as well as tentative signs of stabilization in global economic growth helped reduce downside risks and appeared to buoy business senti- ment. The risk of a “hard” Brexit had appeared to re- cede further. In addition, statistical models designed to estimate the probability of recession using financial mar- ket data suggested that the likelihood of a recession oc- curring over the next year had fallen notably in recent months. Still, participants generally expected trade-re- lated uncertainty to remain somewhat elevated, and they were mindful of the possibility that the tentative signs of stabilization in global growth could fade. Geopolitical risks, especially in connection with the Middle East, re- mained. The threat of the coronavirus, in addition to its human toll, had emerged as a new risk to the global growth outlook, which participants agreed warranted close watching. In their discussion of financial stability, participants acknowledged the staff report suggesting that overall fi- nancial vulnerabilities remained moderate and that the financial system remained resilient. Nonetheless, several participants observed that equity, corporate debt, and CRE valuations were elevated and drew attention to high levels of corporate indebtedness and weak underwriting standards in leveraged loan markets. Some participants expressed the concern that financial imbalances—in- cluding overvaluation and excessive indebtedness— could amplify an adverse shock to the economy, that the current conditions of low interest rates and labor market tightness could increase risks to financial stability, or that cyber attacks could affect the U.S. financial system. Sev- eral participants noted that planned increases in dividend payouts by large banks and the associated decline in cap- ital buffers might leave those banks with less capacity to weather adverse shocks—which could have negative im- plications for the economy—or that lower bank capital Page 16 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ ratios could be associated with greater tail risks to GDP growth. On the other hand, capital levels at U.S. banks were quite high relative to other sectors of the financial system, raising questions about the potential migration of lending activities away from the U.S. banking sector to areas outside the oversight of federal banking super- visors. In their consideration of monetary policy at this meeting, participants judged that it would be appropriate to main- tain the target range for the federal funds rate at 1½ to 1¾ percent to support sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation re- turning to the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent objec- tive. With regard to monetary policy beyond this meet- ing, participants viewed the current stance of policy as likely to remain appropriate for a time, provided that in- coming information about the economy remained broadly consistent with this economic outlook. Of course, if developments emerged that led to a material reassessment of the outlook, an adjustment to the stance of monetary policy would be appropriate, in order to foster achievement of the Committee’s dual-mandate objectives. In commenting on the monetary policy outlook, partici- pants concurred that maintaining the current stance of policy would give the Committee time for a fuller assess- ment of the ongoing effects on economic activity of last year’s shift to a more accommodative policy stance and would also allow policymakers to accumulate further in- formation bearing on the economic outlook. Partici- pants discussed how maintaining the current policy stance for a time could be helpful in supporting U.S. eco- nomic activity and employment in the face of global de- velopments that have been weighing on spending deci- sions. With regard to the Committee’s price-stability objective, participants observed that the current degree of mone- tary policy accommodation would be useful in facilitat- ing a return of inflation to 2 percent. Several participants noted that inflation returning to 2 percent would help ensure that longer-term inflation expectations remained consistent with the Committee’s longer-run inflation ob- jective. A few participants stressed that the Committee should be more explicit about the need to achieve its in- flation goal on a sustained basis. Several participants suggested that inflation modestly exceeding 2 percent for a period would be consistent with the achievement of the Committee’s longer-run inflation objective and that such mild overshooting might underscore the sym- metry of that objective. With regard to the Committee’s maximum employment objective, a few participants ob- served that the actual level of employment might still be below maximum employment and that maintaining the present monetary policy stance would allow the econ- omy to achieve that maximum level. A couple of other participants expressed concern that tight labor markets have in the past been associated with economic and fi- nancial imbalances and that the emergence of such im- balances might jeopardize the longer-run attainment of the Committee’s dual-mandate goals. Participants discussed the open market operations that the Federal Reserve had undertaken since September to implement monetary policy, as well as forthcoming op- erational measures. Participants agreed that the opera- tions undertaken by the Desk since mid-September had been effective in helping to stabilize conditions in money markets and that implementation of the plan that the Committee announced in October to purchase Treasury bills and conduct repo operations had proceeded smoothly. Participants observed that enactment of this plan had succeeded in replenishing reserve balances to levels at or above those prevailing in early September 2019 and in ensuring continued control of the federal funds rate. Many participants stressed that, as reserves approached durably ample levels, the need for sizable Treasury bill purchases and repo operations would di- minish and that such operations could be gradually scaled back or phased out. Beyond that point, regular open market operations would be required over time in order to accommodate the trend growth in the Federal Reserve’s liabilities and maintain an ample level of re- serves. Participants who commented on the Desk’s pro- posal for the transition to the ample-reserves regime in- dicated that they were comfortable with that proposal. They remarked that the details of the Committee’s plans would be adjusted as appropriate to support effective implementation of monetary policy. Participants noted that it would be important to continue to communicate to the public that open market operations now and in the period ahead were technical operations aimed at achieving and maintaining ample reserves and that any adjustments to those operations were not intended to represent a change in the stance of monetary policy. Several participants suggested that the Committee should resume before long its discussion of the role that repo operations might play in an ample-reserves regime, including the possible creation of a standing repo facility. A couple of these participants cited the potential for such a facility to reduce the banking system’s demand for reserves over the longer term. _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Minutes of the Meeting of January 28–29, 2020 Page 17 Committee Policy Action In their discussion of monetary policy for this meeting, members noted that information received since the FOMC met in December indicated that the labor market remained strong and that economic activity had been ris- ing at a moderate rate. Job gains had been solid, on av- erage, in recent months, and the unemployment rate had remained low. Although household spending had been rising at a moderate pace, business fixed investment and exports remained weak. On a 12-month basis, overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and en- ergy were running below 2 percent. Market-based measures of inflation compensation remained low; sur- vey-based measures of longer-term inflation expecta- tions were little changed. Members agreed to maintain the target range for the fed- eral funds rate at 1½ to 1¾ percent. Members judged that the current stance of monetary policy was appropri- ate to support sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation returning to the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent objective. Members also agreed that, in determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the fed- eral funds rate, the Committee would assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its symmetric 2 percent infla- tion objective. And they concurred that this assessment would take into account a wide range of information, in- cluding measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments. With regard to the postmeeting statement, members agreed that incoming data warranted a change in the statement’s description of recent rises in household spending from “strong” to “moderate.” They also agreed to describe the current monetary policy stance as consistent with inflation “returning to,” rather than be- ing “near,” their symmetric 2 percent longer-run objec- tive. In commenting on this change in wording, a few members noted that the new language would make the postmeeting statement more consistent with the Com- mittee’s outlook or might usefully affirm the symmetry of the Committee’s inflation goal and indicate that poli- cymakers were not satisfied with inflation outcomes that were persistently below 2 percent. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the fol- lowing domestic policy directive, for release at 2:00 p.m.: “Effective January 30, 2020, the Federal Open Market Committee directs the Desk to under- take open market operations as necessary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of 1½ to 1¾ percent. In light of recent and expected increases in the Federal Reserve’s non-reserve liabilities, the Committee directs the Desk to continue purchasing Treasury bills at least into the second quarter of 2020 to maintain over time ample reserve balances at or above the level that prevailed in early Sep- tember 2019. The Committee also directs the Desk to continue conducting term and over- night repurchase agreement operations at least through April 2020 to ensure that the supply of reserves remains ample even during periods of sharp increases in non-reserve liabilities, and to mitigate the risk of money market pressures that could adversely affect policy implementa- tion. In addition, the Committee directs the Desk to conduct overnight reverse repurchase operations (and reverse repurchase operations with maturities of more than one day when necessary to accommodate weekend, holiday, or similar trading conventions) at an offering rate of 1.50 percent, in amounts limited only by the value of Treasury securities held outright in the System Open Market Account that are available for such operations and by a per- counterparty limit of $30 billion per day. The Committee directs the Desk to continue rolling over at auction all principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of Treas- ury securities and to continue reinvesting all principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage- backed securities received during each calendar month. Principal payments from agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities up to $20 billion per month will continue to be rein- vested in Treasury securities to roughly match the maturity composition of Treasury securities outstanding; principal payments in excess of $20 billion per month will continue to be rein- vested in agency mortgage-backed securities. Small deviations from these amounts for oper- ational reasons are acceptable. The Committee also directs the Desk to engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal Page 18 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Reserve’s agency mortgage-backed securities transactions.” The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below for release at 2:00 p.m.: “Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in December indicates that the labor market remains strong and that economic activity has been rising at a moderate rate. Job gains have been solid, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate has remained low. Although household spending has been rising at a moderate pace, business fixed investment and exports remain weak. On a 12‑month basis, overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy are run- ning below 2 percent. Market-based measures of inflation compensation remain low; survey- based measures of longer-term inflation expec- tations are little changed. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employ- ment and price stability. The Committee de- cided to maintain the target range for the fed- eral funds rate at 1½ to 1¾ percent. The Com- mittee judges that the current stance of mone- tary policy is appropriate to support sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation returning to the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent objec- tive. The Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook, including global devel- opments and muted inflation pressures, as it as- sesses the appropriate path of the target range for the federal funds rate. In determining the timing and size of future ad- justments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its symmetric 2 percent inflation objective. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pres- sures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments.” Voting for this action: Jerome H. Powell, John C. Williams, Michelle W. Bowman, Lael Brainard, Richard H. Clarida, Patrick Harker, Robert S. Kaplan, Neel Kashkari, Loretta J. Mester, and Randal K. Quarles. Voting against this action: None. Consistent with the Committee’s decision to leave the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged, the Board of Governors voted unanimously to raise the in- terest rates on required and excess reserve balances to 1.60 percent. Setting the interest rate paid on required and excess reserve balances 10 basis points above the bottom of the target range for the federal funds rate is intended to foster trading in the federal funds market at rates well within the FOMC’s target range. The Board of Governors also voted unanimously to approve estab- lishment of the primary credit rate at the existing level of 2.25 percent, effective January 30, 2020. It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Tuesday–Wednesday, March 17–18, 2020. The meeting adjourned at 9:50 a.m. on January 29, 2020. Notation Vote By notation vote completed on January 2, 2020, the Committee unanimously approved the minutes of the Committee meeting held on December 10–11, 2019. _______________________ James A.

Raskin, and Patricia Zobel, Vice Presidents, Federal Reserve Banks of Kansas City, New York, and New York, respectively Karel Mertens, Senior Economic Policy Advisor, Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas Developments in Financial Markets and Open Market Operations The System Open Market Account (SOMA) manager first reviewed developments in domestic and global fi- nancial markets. Financial markets remained exception- ally volatile amid the global spread of the coronavirus and uncertainty regarding its effects. Since the meeting of the FOMC in late January, the S&P 500 index de- clined 18 percent, nominal U.S. Treasury yields moved 60 to 100 basis points lower, and market-based measures of inflation compensation fell 75 to 100 basis points. Investment-grade and high-yield credit spreads widened about 120 basis points and 360 basis points, respectively. The U.S. dollar appreciated notably against most curren- cies, with the exception of other safe-haven currencies, and crude oil prices dropped 40 percent. Against this backdrop, expectations for the path of the federal funds rate adjusted sharply. Implied rates on federal funds fu- tures contracts suggested the Committee was expected to reduce the target range 1 full percentage point at its upcoming scheduled meeting following the 50 basis point reduction in the target range in early March. In addition, market participants reportedly anticipated that the Committee would announce additional purchases of Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securi- ties (MBS). Trading conditions across a range of markets were se- verely strained. In corporate bond markets, trading ac- tivity and liquidity were at very low levels, although not back to the low point reached in 2008. Market partici- pants expected that actions taken to slow the spread of the virus could have significant effects on the credit wor- thiness of certain borrowers, particularly those at the lower end of the credit spectrum. Market participants also increasingly pointed to concerns in other segments of the debt market. In securitized markets, including those for asset-backed securities (ABS) and commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS), primary market is- suance slowed, and secondary market trading had be- come less orderly, with money managers selling short- dated liquid products to meet investor redemptions. In the Treasury market, following several consecutive days of deteriorating conditions, market participants re- ported an acute decline in market liquidity. A number of primary dealers found it especially difficult to make markets in off-the-run Treasury securities and reported that this segment of the market had ceased to function effectively. This disruption in intermediation was at- tributed, in part, to sales of off-the-run Treasury securi- ties and flight-to-quality flows into the most liquid, on-the-run Treasury securities. Conditions in short-term funding markets also deterio- rated sharply amid a decline in market liquidity and chal- lenges in dealer intermediation. Over recent days, the premium paid to obtain dollars through the foreign ex- change swap market increased sharply, and the volumes in term repurchase agreement (repo) markets dropped significantly. Issuance of commercial paper (CP) matur- ing beyond one week reportedly almost dried up at the end of the week before the meeting, and primary- and secondary-market liquidity for financial and nonfinancial CP was described as nearly nonexistent at a time when investor concern about issuer credit risk was rising. The manager then summarized actions taken by the Desk to address some of the strains in financial markets. Repo lending operations were greatly expanded to ad- dress the acute worsening in term funding markets; these operations included the addition of large-scale one- and three-month term repo operations. Despite the sizable offering of additional term repo, take-up was well below the offered amounts, and there was little improvement in Treasury market functioning. As a result, the Chair, in consultation with the FOMC, instructed the Desk to conduct purchases of Treasury securities across a range of maturities. The Desk also revised the schedule of Treasury purchases, announcing that $37 billion of the monthly scheduled purchases would be completed on Friday, March 13. These purchases were conducted across the curve. Market participants suggested that the Page 2 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ operations had been helpful in addressing some funding pressures, but trading conditions in Treasury, mortgage, and credit markets remained severely strained. The SOMA manager noted that, if the FOMC directed the Desk to conduct additional purchases of MBS and Treasury securities, the Desk could initially conduct such purchases at a more rapid pace to more quickly address liquidity strains. By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk’s domestic transactions over the intermeeting period. No intervention operations occurred in foreign currencies for the System’s account during the intermeeting period. Staff Review of the Economic Situation The coronavirus outbreak was disrupting economic ac- tivity in many countries, including the United States, by the time of the March 15 meeting. There were limited available U.S. economic data, however, that covered the period since the intensification of concerns about the domestic effects of the outbreak. Information that pre- dated that period indicated that labor market conditions had remained strong through February and that real gross domestic product (GDP) appeared to have been increasing at a moderate pace in the first two months of the year. Consumer price inflation, as measured by the 12-month percentage change in the price index for per- sonal consumption expenditures (PCE), remained below 2 percent in January. Survey-based measures of longer- run inflation expectations were little changed. Total nonfarm payroll employment expanded strongly in January and February, and the unemployment rate was at its 50-year low of 3.5 percent in February. Meanwhile, the labor force participation rate and the employment- to-population ratio edged up on net. Initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits—a timely indicator of a deterioration in labor market conditions—remained near historically low levels through early March, which was still before economic shutdowns started to take place in the United States. Nominal wage growth was moderate on balance. Average hourly earnings for all employees increased 3 percent over the 12 months end- ing in February. The employment cost index for private- sector workers increased 2.7 percent over the 12 months ending in December, while total labor compensation per hour in the business sector—a highly volatile measure of wage gains—rose 3.6 percent over the four quarters of last year. Total consumer prices, as measured by the PCE price index, increased 1.7 percent over the 12 months ending in January. Core PCE price inflation (which excludes changes in consumer food and energy prices) was 1.6 percent over that same 12-month period. The trimmed mean measure of 12-month PCE price infla- tion constructed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas was 2.1 percent in January. The consumer price index (CPI) rose 2.3 percent over the 12 months ending in February, and the core CPI increased 2.4 percent over that same period. Recent readings on survey-based measures of longer-run inflation expectations were little changed, on balance, in recent months. The Survey of Professional Forecasters measure for the next 10 years was unchanged in the first quarter, as was the longer-run measure from the Blue Chip survey in March. The Uni- versity of Michigan Surveys of Consumers measure for the next 5 to 10 years edged down in February and re- mained in the lower part of its prevailing range in early March. The three-year-ahead measure from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s Survey of Consumer Ex- pectations edged up in February and remained in its re- cent range. Real PCE growth was moderate in January. The com- ponents of the nominal retail sales data used to estimate PCE edged down in February, and the pace of sales of light motor vehicles in January and February was above its fourth-quarter average. However, the consumer sen- timent measure from the Michigan survey started to de- cline notably in early March, and other daily and weekly sentiment measures—such as the Bloomberg Consumer Comfort Index, the Morning Consult confidence index, and the Rasmussen Consumer Index—were also deteri- orating. Both starts and building permit issuance for single- family homes increased in January over their fourth- quarter averages, and starts of multifamily units also moved up. New and existing home sales in January were both above their average fourth-quarter levels. Nominal shipments and new orders of nondefense cap- ital goods excluding aircraft increased solidly in January, although the anticipated resumption of deliveries of the Boeing 737 Max was delayed until later in the year. Nominal business expenditures for nonresidential struc- tures outside of the drilling and mining sector increased in January. The total number of crude oil and natural gas rigs in operation—an indicator of business spending for structures in the drilling and mining sector—was edging up through mid-March and was not yet showing any of the expected falloff from the recent sharp declines in crude oil prices. The available data suggested that manufacturing produc- tion moved up in February after edging down in January, leaving the level of factory output little changed, on net, Minutes of the Meeting of March 15, 2020 Page 3 _____________________________________________________________________________________________ over the past 12 months. Although output in the mining sector—which includes crude oil extraction—had in- creased in January, available data indicated that output in this sector would decrease in February; the recent sharp declines in crude oil prices pointed to a reduction in min- ing-sector production over at least the near term. Total real government purchases appeared to be increas- ing moderately. Federal defense spending rose in Janu- ary and February, and federal employment was boosted by hiring for the 2020 census. State and local govern- ment payrolls expanded strongly in January and Febru- ary, and nominal construction spending by these govern- ments increased solidly in January. The nominal U.S. international trade deficit narrowed in January, as a steep fall in imports more than offset a de- cline in exports. The fall in imports, which followed a sizable fourth-quarter decline, was led by lower imports of industrial supplies, automotive products, and capital goods. The decline in exports was driven by lower ex- ports of capital goods and industrial supplies. Available indicators suggested that both exports and imports likely declined in February, in part reflecting disruptions re- lated to the coronavirus outbreak. The pace of economic growth abroad was already sub- dued before the outbreak. In the advanced foreign economies (AFEs), real GDP growth had slowed sharply at the end of 2019, and indicators pointed to only a modest pickup in economic growth early this year. In the emerging market economies (EMEs), incoming data had been more positive, as indicators for high-tech and manufacturing production in Asian economies outside of China were upbeat, and the effects of social protests in Chile and Hong Kong, along with the effects of the General Motors strike on Mexican economic activity, had faded. By early February, however, the coronavirus outbreak in China brought economic activity in many parts of the country to a standstill. Hubei province, the epicenter of the outbreak and a manufacturing hub, was put under quarantine, and factories across the country were shut down. Foreign economic indicators for the more recent period, following the spread of the virus to the rest of the world, were generally not yet available. However, widespread shutdowns together with lower commodity prices and tighter financial conditions sug- gested that activity was weakening sharply in most for- eign economies. Staff Review of the Financial Situation Concerns about the coronavirus outbreak dominated fi- nancial market developments at home and abroad over the intermeeting period. Equity prices, sovereign yields, and the market-implied expected trajectory of the federal funds rate all plummeted, and the volatility of asset prices soared. Late in the intermeeting period, short- term funding markets showed signs of stress, with ele- vated demand for repo funding and increased short-term spreads. Trading conditions for Treasury securities and MBS were impaired. Moreover, primary issuance of investment-grade corporate bonds was sporadic, and that of speculative-grade corporate bonds and leveraged loans virtually stopped after late February. Data from before the escalation of coronavirus concerns in late February suggested that financial conditions for nonfi- nancial businesses and for households had generally re- mained supportive of economic activity and spending, but developments late in the intermeeting period pointed to tightening credit conditions. Expectations for the path of the federal funds rate de- clined sharply over the intermeeting period. Toward the end of the period, a straight read of overnight index swap (OIS) quotes suggested that the federal funds rate would remain below 25 basis points at least until the middle of 2021. After the 50 basis point decrease in the target range on March 3, prices of federal funds futures options suggested that investors assigned a significant probability to the target range decreasing to 0 to 25 basis points at or before the scheduled March meeting. Yields on nominal Treasury securities plummeted across the maturity spectrum, with the 10- and 30-year yields reaching all-time lows at some point. A staff term struc- ture model largely attributed the decline in the 10-year yield to lower expected future short-term rates. Measures of inflation compensation based on Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities fell sharply and reached a historical low at the 5-to-10-year horizon late in the in- termeeting period. Uncertainty regarding future interest rates increased sharply over the intermeeting period. At one point, the one-month-ahead swaption-implied volatility of the 10-year swap rate surpassed its highest level seen during the “taper tantrum” episode in mid-2013. Treasury mar- ket functioning was severely impaired late in the inter- meeting period, with some dealers reportedly unwilling to make markets for clients and the normal linkage be- tween cash and futures markets broken. Market depth was extremely thin, and bid-ask spreads widened sharply. Broad stock price indexes plummeted because of a flight to safety amid escalating concerns about global eco- nomic activity. Although the declines were broad based, the airline, energy, and bank sectors were among the worst performers. Stock price indexes were extremely Page 4 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ volatile, and the one-month option-implied volatility on the S&P 500 index soared, sometimes reaching levels not seen since the fall of 2008. Corporate bond spreads over comparable-maturity Treasury yields widened sig- nificantly, and spreads on speculative-grade energy bonds widened especially sharply amid plunging oil prices. The 50 basis point decrease in the target range for the federal funds rate announced on March 3 passed through fully to overnight unsecured and secured rates. Conditions in domestic short-term funding markets showed signs of funding strains late in the intermeeting period. The rates on unsecured CP and negotiable cer- tificates of deposit with maturities exceeding one month increased sharply relative to OIS rates, with pronounced effects for issuers in the energy and transportation sec- tors. Overnight and term repo rates were elevated late in the intermeeting period, and the take-up of the Fed- eral Reserve’s repo operations increased substantially for both overnight and term operations. Over the intermeeting period, foreign risk asset prices plummeted amid a rapid deterioration of investor senti- ment due to the global spread of the coronavirus. Major foreign equity indexes dropped sharply over the inter- meeting period, while option-implied volatility measures climbed to their highest levels since the Global Financial Crisis. EME fund outflows accelerated late in the period as emerging market bond spreads widened notably. Most AFE long-term sovereign yields ended the period notably lower. Inflation compensation in the euro area reached new lows. In response to the economic effect of the virus, several central banks cut policy rates and injected liquidity. The broad dollar index strengthened notably over the period, boosted by safe-haven demand, predominantly against EME currencies, and despite a significant decline in U.S. yields. Safe-haven demand also bolstered the Japanese yen and Swiss franc. Policy actions by Chinese authorities supported the Chinese renminbi, which de- preciated about 1.5 percent against the dollar on net. Other EME currencies, such as the Brazilian real and Mexican peso, depreciated sharply, as market partici- pants viewed them as particularly vulnerable to a global economic slowdown and declining commodity prices. Oil prices declined over 40 percent on expectations of lower demand due to the virus outbreak and an unex- pected price cut by Saudi Arabia amid a breakdown of negotiations between OPEC and Russia to reduce pro- duction levels. Financing conditions for nonfinancial firms were strained over the late part of the intermeeting period. After robust issuance earlier in the first quarter, corpo- rate bond issuance came to a near standstill around late February in the midst of elevated volatility following the escalation of concerns about the coronavirus outbreak. Later in the intermeeting period, investment-grade bond issuance resumed intermittently, but speculative-grade issuance and leveraged loan issuance virtually stopped. In addition, some firms reportedly postponed plans to go public. Commercial and industrial loan growth was modest. Credit quality indicators for nonfinancial cor- porations had been solid earlier in the quarter but dete- riorated following the escalation of the coronavirus out- break, particularly for the speculative-grade and energy segments of the market. Measures of the year-ahead ex- pected default rate increased in March to levels slightly under those observed during the oil price plunge in early 2016, reflecting higher expected default rates among speculative-grade firms as well as energy firms. In addi- tion, the outlook for corporate earnings deteriorated somewhat, as equity analysts revised down their earnings per share estimates a notch, and several firms warned that the coronavirus outbreak could hurt their earnings and make them difficult to predict. The supply of credit to small businesses over the fourth quarter of last year had remained relatively accommodative, but loan origi- nations ticked down in January, consistent with ongoing reports of weak loan demand. Market turmoil spilled into municipal bond markets late in the intermeeting period, as spreads widened substan- tially and some borrowers became hesitant to come to the market. Credit conditions in the municipal market had been accommodative over the early part of the in- termeeting period, and issuance volumes in late February were reportedly boosted by strong investor demand for low-risk assets. Financing conditions in the commercial real estate (CRE) sector worsened late in the intermeeting period, as issuance of CMBS slowed and spreads widened nota- bly to around levels seen in 2016. Data from before the escalation of concerns over the coronavirus outbreak pointed to accommodative financing conditions. CRE loan growth at banks remained solid through February and CRE debt outstanding increased modestly through mid-February, according to available data. The primary mortgage rate increased sharply toward the end of the period as MBS market liquidity deteriorated, after falling substantially in February and early March. Capacity constraints at mortgage originators reportedly Minutes of the Meeting of March 15, 2020 Page 5 _____________________________________________________________________________________________ intensified, while borrower interest in refinancing in- creased significantly from already elevated levels. More- over, additional constraints emerged as it became more difficult to conduct operations that usually happen face- to-face. Financing conditions in consumer credit markets wors- ened late in the intermeeting period. Strains began ap- pearing in consumer ABS markets, although less so than in other fixed-income markets. In March, consumer ABS spreads widened sharply, liquidity deteriorated, and new issuance became sporadic. Lenders in consumer credit markets began developing programs to assist bor- rowers whose finances were affected by the outbreak. Earlier in the intermeeting period, financing conditions had been generally supportive of growth. Credit card balances and auto loan balances both appeared to grow solidly through February, according to banks’ data, con- tinuing their growth in the fourth quarter. Conditions for subprime credit card borrowers remained relatively tight but showed some signs of easing. Staff Economic Outlook The projection for the U.S. economy prepared by the staff for the March FOMC meeting was downgraded sig- nificantly from the January meeting forecast in response to news on the spread of the coronavirus at home and abroad and in response to a related substantial mark- down of the staff’s foreign economic outlook, along with recent financial market movements. Real GDP was forecast to decline and the unemployment rate to rise, on net, in the first half of this year. Given the downside risks and the elevated uncertainty about how much the economy would weaken and how long it would take to recover, the staff provided two plausible economic sce- narios that spanned a range of possibilities. Importantly, the future performance of the economy would depend on the evolution of the virus outbreak and the measures undertaken to contain it. In one scenario, economic ac- tivity started to rebound in the second half of this year. In a more adverse scenario, the economy entered reces- sion this year, with a recovery much slower to take hold and not materially under way until next year. In both scenarios, inflation was projected to weaken, reflecting both the deterioration in resource utilization and sizable expected declines in consumer energy prices. Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook Participants noted that the coronavirus outbreak was harming communities and disrupting economic activity in many countries, including the United States, and that global financial conditions had also been significantly af- fected. Participants expressed their deep concern for those whose health had been harmed and observed that the matter was, above all, a public health emergency. They commented that the measures—such as social dis- tancing—taken in response to the pandemic, while needed to contain the outbreak, would nevertheless take a toll on U.S. economic activity in the near term. Participants noted that available economic data showed that the U.S. economy came into this challenging period on a strong footing. Information received since the Committee met in January indicated that the labor mar- ket remained strong through February and that eco- nomic activity rose at a moderate rate. Job gains had been solid, on average, in recent months, and the unem- ployment rate had remained low. Although household spending had risen at a moderate pace, business fixed investment and exports had remained weak; further- more, in recent weeks the energy sector had come under stress due to the sharp drop in oil prices. On a 12-month basis, overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy had been running below 2 percent. Survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expecta- tions had been little changed. However, market-based measures of inflation compensation had declined. All participants viewed the near-term U.S. economic outlook as having deteriorated sharply in recent weeks and as having become profoundly uncertain. Many par- ticipants had repeatedly downgraded their outlook of late in response to the rapidly evolving situation. All saw U.S. economic activity as likely to decline in the coming quarter and viewed downside risks to the economic out- look as having increased significantly. Participants noted that the timing of the resumption of growth in the U.S. economy depended on the containment measures put in place, as well as the success of those measures, and on the responses of other policies, including fiscal policy. With regard to households’ behavior, participants noted that, although consumption spending had been a key driver of growth in economic activity through the first two months of this year, the pandemic was starting to impair consumer confidence and to exert an adverse ef- fect on household balance sheets. Participants reported that wide-ranging social-distancing measures were in op- eration or in prospect in their Districts. These measures—which included temporary closures of some physical locations, such as stores and restaurants, in which consumers purchased goods and services—would have the effect of reducing in-person transactions by households. Online shopping could substitute for some Page 6 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ of this activity but was unlikely to replace it fully. The housing market was likely to be disrupted by social dis- tancing, by financial uncertainty—including difficulties that households and businesses would face in meeting mortgage or rental payments—and by volatility in the market for MBS. Participants stressed the major down- side risk that the spread of the virus might intensify in those areas of the country currently less affected, thereby sidelining many more U.S. workers and further damping purchases by consumers. Participants expressed con- cern that households with low incomes had less of a sav- ings buffer with which to meet expenses during the in- terruption to economic activity. This situation made those households more vulnerable to a downturn in the economy and tended to magnify the reduction in aggre- gate demand associated with the nation’s response to the pandemic. Participants relayed reports on business sectors already badly hit by the response to the coronavirus outbreak. These sectors included those affected by the cancellation of many events, decisions by firms and households to reduce travel, government-mandated reductions in entry from abroad, and cutbacks on economic activity that re- quired in-person interaction. Firms directly affected in- cluded those connected to air travel, cruise lines, hotels, tourism services, sports and recreation, entertainment, hospitality, and restaurants. In the past week, pullbacks in purchases at retail stores, except for emergency buy- ing, had reportedly intensified significantly. In addition, the energy sector had come under stress because of re- cent large declines in oil prices. Many U.S. businesses had moved to telework arrangements; other businesses, however, could not readily shift to telework status or had limited telework technology. Participants observed that the coronavirus outbreak had inevitably hurt business confidence and that the expected length and severity of the restrictions on economic activity that involved in- person interaction would importantly affect the size of the response of investment spending to the situation. Participants expressed concern about the financial strain that many U.S. firms were under because of the loss of business and the extraordinary turbulence in financial markets. With regard to supply chains, many contacts had reported that some linkages in China had been re- stored and that they were able to draw on inventory sup- plies and on alternative supply chains; however, in some areas of the country, the construction industry had re- ported continuing disruptions to supply chains from China. Participants indicated that disruptions in the Eu- ropean economy and recent restrictions on travel from Europe to the United States would adversely affect the U.S. economy’s supply chains; so too, if it eventuated, would a large increase in U.S. worker unavailability be- cause of health reasons. Several participants emphasized concern about the capacity of the health care system in the current situation and welcomed measures taken to prevent the system’s overall capacity from being ex- ceeded. Participants noted that foreign economic growth for the first half of this year would be badly hit by the severe disruptions to economic activity abroad associated with the response to the coronavirus outbreak, including the recent measures taken in major European countries. However, some encouraging signs had come from China in recent weeks in the form of indications of increasing production and of more purchases of U.S. goods. With regard to the labor market, participants noted that some firms would likely need to cut employment imme- diately. Other firms, however, were looking for ways to retain employees during the period of reduced economic activity, in order to maintain capacity and be able to ramp up production once the public health crisis abated and demand rebounded. Measures that reportedly helped partially substitute for layoffs included the en- couragement by employers of voluntary leaves of ab- sence, non-replacement of departing workers, and in- creased reliance on the delivery of goods to customers in place of on-site purchases. Participants observed that businesses would be more likely to lay off workers on a major scale if the downturn in economic activity came to be perceived as likely to be protracted. Participants commented that workers most severely affected in the current situation were those who were ill, those with low incomes, those connected to the most hard-hit sectors, and those with irregular or contingent employment. They also noted that many workers had jobs that did not permit working from home. With regard to inflation, participants noted that it had been running below the Committee’s 2 percent longer- run objective before the coronavirus outbreak. They re- marked that a stronger dollar, weaker demand, and lower oil prices were factors likely to put downward pressure on inflation in the period ahead and observed that this meant that the return of inflation to the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run objective would likely be further delayed. Participants indicated, however, that imple- menting a more accommodative stance of monetary pol- icy at this meeting could be useful in helping offset these factors over time and in achieving the 2 percent inflation Minutes of the Meeting of March 15, 2020 Page 7 _____________________________________________________________________________________________ objective over the longer run, by helping prevent cir- cumstances of persistent resource slack or a lasting de- cline in inflation expectations. Participants all agreed that the effects of the pandemic would weigh on economic activity in the near term and that the duration of this period of weakness was uncer- tain. They further concurred that the unpredictable ef- fects of the coronavirus outbreak were a source of major downside risks to the economic outlook. Participants raised several alternative scenarios with regard to the likely behavior of economic activity in the second half of this year. These scenarios differed from one another in the assumed length and severity of disruptions to eco- nomic activity. Several participants emphasized that the temporary nature of the shock to economic activity, the fact that the shock arose in the nonfinancial sector, and the healthy state of the U.S. banking system all implied that the current situation was not directly comparable with the previous decade’s financial crisis and it need not be followed by negative effects on economic activity as long-lasting as those associated with that crisis. Partici- pants stressed that measures taken in the areas of health care policy and fiscal policy, together with actions by the private sector, would be important in shaping the timing and speed of the U.S. economy’s return to normal con- ditions. Participants agreed that the Federal Reserve’s efforts to relieve stress in financial markets would help limit downside near-term outcomes by supporting credit flows to households and businesses, and that a more ac- commodative monetary policy stance would provide support to economic activity beyond the near term. Among the downside risks to this year’s U.S. economic outlook, participants prominently cited the possibility of the virus outbreak becoming more widespread than ex- pected. Such an event could lead to more wide-ranging temporary shutdowns, with adverse implications for the production of goods and services and for aggregate de- mand. With regard to financial developments over the inter- meeting period, participants noted that financial markets had exhibited extraordinary turbulence and stresses. Participants commented on the conditions of high vola- tility and illiquidity characterizing the markets for U.S. Treasury securities, especially off-the-run longer-term securities, and for agency MBS. Participants expressed concern about the disruptions to the functioning of these markets, especially in view of their status as cor- nerstones for the operation of the U.S. and global finan- cial systems and for the transmission of monetary policy. Participants observed that Federal Reserve operations in recent days had provided some relief with regard to the liquidity problems, but they noted that severe illiquidity continued to prevail in key securities markets. Many par- ticipants pointed to other dislocations in funding mar- kets that could impede financial intermediation to households and businesses. They highlighted the acute problems that many firms were facing in issuing CP and corporate bonds. Participants further noted that many businesses were tapping their backup credit lines with commercial banks. Participants also discussed the im- plications of recent financial market turbulence for money market funds and government bond funds and for debt issuance by state and local governments. In their consideration of monetary policy at this meeting, most participants judged that it would be appropriate to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 100 basis points, to 0 to ¼ percent. In discussing the reasons for such a decision, these participants pointed to a likely decline in economic activity in the near term re- lated to the effects of the coronavirus outbreak and the extremely large degree of uncertainty regarding how long and severe such a decline in activity would be. In light of the sharply increased downside risks to the economic outlook posed by the global coronavirus outbreak, these participants noted that risk-management considerations pointed toward a forceful monetary policy response, with the majority favoring a 100 basis point cut that would bring the target range to its effective lower bound (ELB). With regard to monetary policy beyond this meeting, these participants judged that it would be ap- propriate to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent until policymakers were con- fident that the economy had weathered recent events and was on track to achieve the Committee’s maximum employment and price stability goals. A few participants preferred a 50 basis point cut at this meeting and noted that such a decision would provide support to economic activity in the face of the antici- pated effects of the coronavirus. These participants pre- ferred to wait until there was greater assurance that the transmission mechanism of monetary policy via financial markets and the supply of credit to households and busi- nesses was working effectively. This would allow fiscal and public health policy responses to the coronavirus outbreak to take hold and preserve the ability of the Committee to lower the target range, which was close to the ELB, in the event of a further deterioration in the economic outlook. In addition, these participants noted that a lowering of the target range by 100 basis points, coming so soon after the reduction of 50 basis points less than two weeks earlier, ran the risk of sending an overly negative signal about the economic outlook. Page 8 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Participants also considered open market operations to purchase Treasury securities and agency MBS to support the smooth functioning of these securities markets, which in turn would help support the supply of credit to households and businesses. Participants generally agreed that, over the coming months, it would be appro- priate to increase the Federal Reserve’s holdings of Treasury securities by at least $500 billion and its hold- ings of agency MBS by at least $200 billion. Addition- ally, all principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of agency debt and agency MBS would be rein- vested in agency MBS. Those Treasury and agency MBS purchases would be in addition to the recently expanded overnight and term repo operations conducted by the Desk. Participants stressed that it was important to communicate that the Committee would be prepared to increase the size of the securities purchases, as needed, on the basis of its close monitoring of market condi- tions. Some participants noted that it was important to stress in communications that the primary purpose of these asset purchases was to support the smooth func- tioning of Treasury and agency MBS markets rather than to provide further monetary policy accommodation by pushing down longer-term yields. A couple of partici- pants noted that because some of the purchases would be at longer maturities, the purchases could provide some accommodation by lowering longer-term yields. Participants discussed some of the possible communica- tions challenges associated with the Committee’s policy decisions at this meeting. Several participants noted that it would be important to communicate clearly and con- sistently about the rationale for the policy decisions taken at this meeting. Some participants remarked that the Committee’s policy actions regarding the target range and balance sheet could be interpreted as convey- ing negative news about the economic outlook. A few participants also remarked that lowering the target range to the ELB could increase the likelihood that some mar- ket interest rates would turn negative, or foster investor expectations of negative policy rates. Such expectations would run counter to participants’ previously expressed views that they would prefer to use other monetary pol- icy tools to provide further accommodation at the ELB. Additionally, several participants remarked that the pub- lic might view the ability of the Committee to provide further monetary policy accommodation as being lim- ited. However, some participants noted that the Com- mittee would still be able to provide monetary policy ac- commodation even after lowering the target range for the federal funds rate to the ELB. In particular, new forward guidance or balance sheet measures could be in- troduced. Participants also indicated strong support for related ac- tions taken by the Board of Governors to support the credit needs of households and businesses: • to lower the primary credit rate by 150 basis points to ¼ percent and to allow depository in- stitutions to borrow from the discount window for periods as long as 90 days in order to encour- age more active use of the discount window on the part of depository institutions to meet unex- pected funding needs • to encourage depository institutions to utilize in- traday credit to support the provision of liquidity to households and businesses and the smooth functioning of payment systems • to encourage banks to use their capital and li- quidity buffers as they provide loans to house- holds and businesses affected by the coronavirus and undertake other supportive actions in a safe and sound manner • to reduce reserve requirements to 0 percent in light of the shift to an ample-reserves regime and to support lending to households and businesses by depository institutions Participants also indicated support for enhancing, in co- ordination with the Bank of Canada, the Bank of Eng- land, the Bank of Japan, the European Central Bank, and the Swiss National Bank, the provision of liquidity via the standing U.S. dollar liquidity swap line arrangements. The pricing on the standing U.S. dollar swap arrange- ments would be lowered by 25 basis points so that the new rate would be the U.S. dollar OIS rate plus 25 basis points, and U.S. dollars would be offered by foreign cen- tral banks with an 84-day maturity, in addition to the 1-week maturity operations. Following this discussion, the Chair indicated that these changes to the standing U.S. dollar liquidity swap line arrangements would be implemented consistent with the procedures described in the Authorization for Foreign Currency Operations. Participants generally commented that these additional measures would be helpful in supporting the flow of credit to households and businesses. A few participants commented that stigma associated with the discount window may still be present or that further action, such as a relaunch of the Term Auction Facility, might be needed to encourage banks to take up additional fund- ing. A few other participants noted that discount win- Minutes of the Meeting of March 15, 2020 Page 9 _____________________________________________________________________________________________ dow stigma should be less of a concern than it was pre- viously. In particular, these participants cited the lower- ing of the primary credit rate to the top of the target range for the federal funds rate, offering term funding for up to 90 days, and regulators encouraging banks to use the discount window to continue prudently lending to households and businesses. Several participants com- mented that banks should be discouraged from repur- chasing shares from, or paying dividends to, their equity holders in the wake of the proposed measures. Partici- pants generally noted that other measures to support the flow of credit to households and businesses, including those that relied on section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act, might be needed in such an uncertain and rapidly evolving environment and that it would be prudent for the Federal Reserve to develop and remain prepared to implement such measures. Committee Policy Action In their discussion of monetary policy for this meeting, members noted that the coronavirus outbreak had harmed communities and disrupted economic activity in many countries, including the United States, and that global financial conditions had also been significantly af- fected. Available economic data showed that the U.S. economy came into this challenging period on a strong footing, with a strong labor market, a low unemploy- ment rate, and moderate growth in household spending, although business fixed investment and exports had re- mained weak. More recently, the energy sector had come under stress. On a 12-month basis, overall infla- tion and inflation for items other than food and energy were running below 2 percent. Market-based measures of inflation compensation had declined, and survey- based measures of longer-term inflation expectations were little changed. Members judged that the effects of the coronavirus would weigh on economic activity in the near term and would pose risks to the economic outlook. In light of these developments, almost all members agreed to lower the target range for the federal funds rate to 0 to ¼ per- cent. These members expected that the target range would be maintained at this level until they were confi- dent that the economy had weathered recent events and was on track to achieve the Committee’s maximum em- ployment and price stability goals. One member pre- ferred to lower the target range by 50 basis points, to ½ to ¾ percent, at this meeting, in support of the actions taken to promote smooth market functioning and the flow of credit to households and businesses and in light of the anticipated effects of the coronavirus on eco- nomic activity and the economic outlook. In this partic- ipant’s view, a 50 basis point cut would preserve space for further cuts in the target range that could be imple- mented when market conditions had improved enough to ensure that the monetary policy transmission mecha- nism was functioning. Members noted that they would continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook, including information related to public health as well as global developments and muted inflation pres- sures, and that the Committee would use its tools and act as appropriate to support the economy. Members observed that, in determining the timing and size of fu- ture adjustments to the stance of monetary policy, the Committee would assess realized and expected eco- nomic conditions relative to its maximum-employment objective and its symmetric 2 percent inflation objective. They also agreed that those assessments would take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pres- sures and inflation expectations, and readings on finan- cial and international developments. Members emphasized that the Federal Reserve was pre- pared to use its full range of tools to support the flow of credit to households and businesses and thereby pro- mote its maximum-employment and price-stability goals. To support the smooth functioning of markets for Treasury securities and agency MBS that are central to the flow of credit to households and businesses, over coming months the Committee agreed to increase its holdings of Treasury securities by at least $500 billion and its holdings of agency MBS by at least $200 billion. The Committee also agreed to reinvest all principal pay- ments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of agency debt and MBS in agency MBS. In addition, members noted that the Desk had recently expanded its overnight and term repo operations. Members indicated that they would continue to closely monitor market conditions and that the Committee was prepared to adjust its plans as appropriate. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the fol- lowing domestic policy directive: “Effective March 16, 2020, the Federal Open Market Committee directs the Desk to under- take open market operations as necessary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of 0 to ¼ percent. The Committee directs the Page 10 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Desk to increase over coming months the Sys- tem Open Market Account holdings of Treas- ury securities and agency mortgage-backed se- curities (MBS) by at least $500 billion and by at least $200 billion, respectively. The Committee instructs the Desk to conduct these purchases at a pace appropriate to support the smooth functioning of markets for Treasury securities and agency MBS. The Committee also directs the Desk to con- tinue conducting term and overnight repur- chase agreement operations to ensure that the supply of reserves remains ample and to sup- port the smooth functioning of short-term U.S. dollar funding markets. In addition, the Com- mittee directs the Desk to conduct overnight re- verse repurchase operations (and reverse repur- chase operations with maturities of more than one day when necessary to accommodate week- end, holiday, or similar trading conventions) at an offering rate of 0.00 percent, in amounts lim- ited only by the value of Treasury securities held outright in the System Open Market Account that are available for such operations and by a per-counterparty limit of $30 billion per day. The Committee directs the Desk to continue rolling over at auction all principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of Treasury securities and to reinvest all principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities re- ceived during each calendar month in agency mortgage-backed securities. Small deviations from these amounts for operational reasons are acceptable. The Committee also directs the Desk to engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal Reserve’s agency mortgage-backed securities transactions.” The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below for release at 5:00 p.m.: “The coronavirus outbreak has harmed com- munities and disrupted economic activity in many countries, including the United States. Global financial conditions have also been sig- nificantly affected. Available economic data show that the U.S. economy came into this chal- lenging period on a strong footing. Information received since the Federal Open Market Com- mittee met in January indicates that the labor market remained strong through February and economic activity rose at a moderate rate. Job gains have been solid, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate has re- mained low. Although household spending rose at a moderate pace, business fixed invest- ment and exports remained weak. More re- cently, the energy sector has come under stress. On a 12-month basis, overall inflation and infla- tion for items other than food and energy are running below 2 percent. Market-based measures of inflation compensation have de- clined; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Com- mittee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. The effects of the corona- virus will weigh on economic activity in the near term and pose risks to the economic outlook. In light of these developments, the Committee decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate to 0 to ¼ percent. The Committee expects to maintain this target range until it is confident that the economy has weathered re- cent events and is on track to achieve its maxi- mum employment and price stability goals. This action will help support economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation re- turning to the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent objective. The Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook, including information re- lated to public health, as well as global develop- ments and muted inflation pressures, and will use its tools and act as appropriate to support the economy. In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the stance of mon- etary policy, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its sym- metric 2 percent inflation objective. This as- sessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor mar- ket conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on fi- nancial and international developments.

Bowman, Lael Brainard, Richard H. Clarida, Patrick Harker, Robert S. Kaplan, Neel Kashkari, and Randal K. Quarles. Voting against this action: Loretta J. Mester President Mester was fully supportive of all of the ac- tions taken to promote the smooth functioning of mar- kets and the flow of credit to households and businesses but voted against the FOMC action because she pre- ferred to reduce the target range for the federal funds rate to ½ to ¾ percent at this meeting. Consistent with the Committee’s decision to lower the target range for the federal funds rate to 0 to ¼ percent, the Board of Governors voted unanimously to lower the interest rate paid on required and excess reserve balances to 0.10 percent and voted unanimously to approve a 1½ percentage point decrease in the primary credit rate to 0.25 percent, effective March 16, 2020. The Board also approved changes to allow Reserve Banks to extend primary credit loans for as long as 90 days and that could be prepaid or renewed on re- quest. In addition, the Board approved a reduction in reserve requirement ratios applicable to net transaction deposits above the exemption threshold to 0 percent ef- fective with the reserve maintenance period beginning on March 26, 2020. It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Tuesday–Wednesday, April 28– 29, 2020. The meeting adjourned at 2:40 p.m. on March 15, 2020. Notation Vote By notation vote completed on February 18, 2020, the Committee unanimously approved the minutes of the Committee meeting held on January 28–29, 2020. Videoconference meeting of March 2 A joint meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee and the Board of Governors was held by videoconfer- ence on March 2, 2020, at 7:30 p.m. to review develop- ments related to the outbreak of the coronavirus and dis- cuss steps that could be taken to provide support to the economy. As background for the Committee’s discus- sion, the staff reviewed recent developments in financial markets and provided an assessment of the evolving risks to the economic outlook. The SOMA manager noted that since mid-February when concerns about the spread of the coronavirus be- yond China had begun to intensify, global risk asset prices and sovereign yields had declined sharply. U.S. and global equity indexes were lower than at the time of the Committee’s meeting in January and implied equity market volatility had risen to levels not seen since 2015. The deterioration in risk sentiment had also been re- flected in a significant widening in U.S. and European corporate credit spreads and in peripheral European spreads. Amid the ongoing market volatility, issuance of investment-grade and high-yield corporate bonds and of leveraged loans had generally dried up. Money markets had been resilient during the broader financial market volatility; pricing and trading conditions in offshore U.S. dollar funding markets had also been stable. Market functioning had remained orderly despite deterioration in liquidity conditions in Treasury, equity, and credit markets. Financial market participants’ views on the likely course of U.S. monetary policy had changed since the Commit- tee’s January meeting. The expected path of the federal funds rate embedded in futures prices had shifted down significantly over the period. Market commentary had interpreted Chair Powell’s February 28 statement as in- dicating the FOMC was prepared to lower the target range for the federal funds rate at or before the March meeting to support the achievement of the Committee’s maximum employment and price stability goals. Expec- tations for global monetary and fiscal easing had in- Page 12 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ creased, with some market commentary noting the pos- sibility of a coordinated effort across central banks or fiscal authorities. The SOMA manager noted that the situation remained highly fluid with key risks, including those associated with funding for corporate borrowers, operational vul- nerabilities associated with the transition to alternative work arrangements, and the potential for impaired mar- ket functioning. The staff then provided an update on current conditions and changes to the economic outlook since the FOMC’s January meeting. Available indicators for China sug- gested that the spread of the coronavirus had been asso- ciated with a collapse in economic activity during the first quarter, with spillovers to the global economy from the drop in Chinese demand and disruption of supply chains. Although there were some tentative signs that the coronavirus in China was being contained and pro- duction was beginning to resume, the outbreak of the virus in other foreign economies was weighing on con- sumer and business sentiment and depressing consump- tion in those countries. All told, foreign economic ac- tivity was expected to be significantly weaker during the first half of 2020 than the staff had anticipated at the time of the January FOMC meeting. The staff noted that the spread of the virus was at an earlier stage in the United States and its effects were not yet visible in monthly economic indicators, although there had been some softening in daily sentiment in- dexes and travel-related transactions. The outlook for real economic activity over the remainder of the year was highly uncertain and depended on the spread of the virus and the measures taken to contain it. Scenarios involv- ing a greater spread of the coronavirus and more severe social-distancing actions would be associated with a greater shutdown of production and disruption of sup- ply chains, larger negative effects on consumer and busi- ness sentiment, more significant increases in unemploy- ment, and worsening financial conditions. Reductions in demand, coupled with a stronger U.S. dollar and weaker commodity prices, were expected to put down- ward pressure on inflation, with the magnitude of the softening in core inflation depending on the severity of the situation. FOMC participants discussed the significant outbreaks of the coronavirus that had emerged recently in a few countries outside China and the likelihood that the virus would spread widely around the world, including in the United States. While the economic outlook at the time of the Committee’s January meeting had been favorable, the potential spread of the virus and the measures needed to protect communities from it represented a material downside risk to the U.S. economy. A forceful monetary policy action could provide a clear signal to the public that policymakers recognized the potential eco- nomic significance of the situation and were willing to move decisively to support the achievement of the Com- mittee’s dual mandate goals and counter the recent tight- ening of financial conditions. Although a reduction in the policy rate would not slow the spread of infection or remedy broken supply chains, it could help shore up the confidence of households, businesses, and financial mar- kets; ease financial strains of consumers and firms; and provide meaningful support to the economy in the face of a large shock to demand. Accordingly, participants supported a reduction of 50 basis points in the target range for the federal funds rate. On March 3, 2020, the Committee completed the vote to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: “Effective March 4, 2020, the Federal Open Market Committee directs the Desk to under- take open market operations as necessary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of 1 to 1¼ percent. In light of recent and ex- pected increases in the Federal Reserve’s non- reserve liabilities, the Committee directs the Desk to continue purchasing Treasury bills at least into the second quarter of 2020 to maintain over time ample reserve balances at or above the level that prevailed in early September 2019. The Committee also directs the Desk to con- tinue conducting term and overnight repur- chase agreement operations at least through April 2020 to ensure that the supply of reserves remains ample even during periods of sharp in- creases in non-reserve liabilities, and to mitigate the risk of money market pressures that could adversely affect policy implementation. In ad- dition, the Committee directs the Desk to con- duct overnight reverse repurchase operations (and reverse repurchase operations with matur- ities of more than one day when necessary to accommodate weekend, holiday, or similar trad- ing conventions) at an offering rate of 1.00 per- cent, in amounts limited only by the value of Treasury securities held outright in the System Open Market Account that are available for Minutes of the Meeting of March 15, 2020 Page 13 _____________________________________________________________________________________________ such operations and by a per-counterparty limit of $30 billion per day. The Committee directs the Desk to continue rolling over at auction all principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of Treasury securities and to continue reinvesting all princi- pal payments from the Federal Reserve’s hold- ings of agency debt and agency mortgage- backed securities received during each calendar month. Principal payments from agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities up to $20 billion per month will continue to be rein- vested in Treasury securities to roughly match the maturity composition of Treasury securities outstanding; principal payments in excess of $20 billion per month will continue to be rein- vested in agency mortgage-backed securities. Small deviations from these amounts for oper- ational reasons are acceptable. The Committee also directs the Desk to engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal Reserve’s agency mortgage-backed securities transactions.” The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below for release at 10:00 a.m. on March 3, 2020: “The fundamentals of the U.S. economy remain strong. However, the coronavirus poses evolv- ing risks to economic activity. In light of these risks and in support of achieving its maximum employment and price stability goals, the Fed- eral Open Market Committee decided today to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by ½ percentage point, to 1 to 1¼ percent. The Committee is closely monitoring developments and their implications for the economic outlook and will use its tools and act as appropriate to support the economy.” Voting for this action: Jerome H. Powell, John C. Williams, Michelle W. Bowman, Lael Brainard, Richard H. Clarida, Patrick Harker, Robert S. Kaplan, Neel Kashkari, Loretta J. Mester, and Randal K. Quarles. Consistent with the Committee’s decision to lower the target range for the federal funds rate to 1 to 1¼ per- cent, the Board of Governors completed on March 3, 2020, unanimous votes to lower the interest rate paid on required and excess reserve balances to 1.10 percent and to approve a ½ percentage point decrease in the primary credit rate to 1.75 percent, effective March 4, 2020. _______________________ James A.

Lee Smith, Research and Policy Advisor, Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City Developments in Financial Markets and Open Mar- ket Operations The System Open Market Account (SOMA) manager first discussed developments in financial markets. Fi- nancial conditions had shown notable improvement over recent weeks. Equity price indexes were up sub- stantially from the lows of late March, safe-haven de- mands for the dollar had receded, and measures of real- ized and implied volatility across markets had dimin- ished. Market participants pointed to swift and forceful actions taken by the Federal Reserve, coupled with strong fiscal measures, and some indications of a slowing in the spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19) in major economies as factors contributing to these develop- ments. That said, market participants remained very uncertain about the economic outlook, and contacts highlighted an array of remaining risks, including those in corporate credit markets, emerging markets, and mortgage mar- kets. In corporate credit markets, concerns about po- tential defaults were rising, and ratings agencies had put on negative watch or downgraded many issuers. In emerging markets, the steep decline in commodity prices was exacerbating financial pressures for some emerging market economies (EMEs), which were also facing strains arising from capital outflows and a reduction in trade activity. And in mortgage markets, the likely in- crease in mortgage delinquencies associated with for- bearance polices and an eventual rise in defaults were sources of concern for bank and nonbank lenders. Open Market Desk surveys suggested that market par- ticipants anticipated a sharp near-term decline in eco- nomic activity, followed by some recovery later this year. Against this backdrop, market participants generally ex- pected the target range for the federal funds rate to re- main at the effective lower bound for the next couple of years. Respondents to Desk surveys attached almost no probability to the FOMC implementing negative policy rates. Some survey respondents indicated that they ex- pected modifications to the Committee’s forward guid- ance, but not at the current meeting. The manager then reviewed recent open market opera- tions. Since mid-March, at the direction of the FOMC, the Desk had purchased very large quantities of Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) in order to support the smooth functioning of these critical mar- kets. The Desk evaluated a broad array of indicators to assess market functioning. These indicators suggested considerable improvement in market functioning, and the Desk gradually scaled back the pace of purchases ac- cordingly. Market participants anticipated that the pace of purchases would slow after the June meeting, but they expected that outright securities holdings in the SOMA portfolio would continue to expand at least through the end of the year. The SOMA manager expected that, if Page 2 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ conditions continued to improve, the pace of purchases could be reduced somewhat further; however, consistent with the directive, the Desk was prepared to increase purchases as needed should market functioning worsen. Conditions in money markets had improved over recent weeks. The intense strains across a range of short-term funding markets that emerged in March had subsided. The expansion of Federal Reserve repurchase agreement (repo) operations, the enhancement and expansion of funding available through the discount window and swap lines, and the funding provided through the Pri- mary Dealer Credit Facility (PDCF), the Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility (MMLF), and the Com- mercial Paper Funding Facility (CPFF) were likely im- portant in relieving pressures across a range of short- term funding markets. The manager noted that, despite these improvements, rates in some term funding mar- kets remained elevated, although forward measures sug- gested the upward pressure on these rates might ease in coming weeks. With conditions in short-term funding markets having improved substantially and with repo operations no longer needed to maintain ample reserve levels, the manager noted that it might be appropriate to position the Federal Reserve’s repurchase operations in a backstop role. For example, the minimum bid rate in repo operations could be increased somewhat relative to the level of the interest rate on excess reserves (the IOER rate). Later in the intermeeting period, short-term interest rates drifted lower and settled at near-zero levels. Al- though rates appeared stable, the manager suggested that circumstances could arise in which temporarily raising the per-counterparty limit on the overnight reverse repo operation would support policy implementation. The manager also noted that some market participants antic- ipated that the Federal Reserve might increase the IOER rate in order to move the federal funds rate closer to the middle of the target range and to address market func- tioning issues that could arise over time with overnight rates at very low levels. However, there appeared to be limited risk that the federal funds rate would move be- low the target range, as the Federal Home Loan Banks— the dominant lenders in the federal funds market—can earn a zero rate on balances maintained in their account at the Federal Reserve. Moreover, there were few signs to date that the low level of overnight funding rates had adversely affected market functioning, and trading vol- umes remained robust. The SOMA manager noted that the staff would continue to monitor developments. The Committee voted unanimously to renew the recip- rocal currency arrangements with the Bank of Canada and the Bank of Mexico; these arrangements are associ- ated with the Federal Reserve’s participation in the North American Framework Agreement of 1994. In ad- dition, the Committee voted unanimously to renew the dollar and foreign currency liquidity swap arrangements with the Bank of Canada, the Bank of England, the Bank of Japan, the European Central Bank, and the Swiss Na- tional Bank. The votes to renew the Federal Reserve’s participation in these standing arrangements occur an- nually at the April or May FOMC meeting. By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk’s domestic transactions over the intermeeting period. There were no intervention operations in foreign curren- cies for the System’s account during the intermeeting pe- riod. Staff Review of the Economic Situation The coronavirus outbreak and the measures taken to protect public health were severely disrupting economic activity in the United States and abroad. The available information for the April 28–29 meeting indicated that U.S. labor market conditions deteriorated substantially in March and April, and real gross domestic product (GDP) declined sharply in the first quarter of the year. In addition, a variety of economic indicators were al- ready pointing toward an extraordinary contraction in GDP in the second quarter. Consumer price inflation, as measured by the 12-month percentage change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE), remained below 2 percent in February. Job losses surged in March, even though the drop in to- tal nonfarm payroll employment reflected only those changes that had occurred through the mid-month ref- erence period of the establishment survey. In addition, the unemployment rate jumped to 4.4 percent in March, and the labor force participation rate decreased notably. After economic shutdowns started to occur on a wide- spread basis, initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits skyrocketed in the second half of March through the first half of April, a development that pointed to substantial job losses in April. Nominal wage growth remained moderate, as average hourly earnings for all employees increased 3.1 percent over the 12 months ending in March. Total PCE price inflation and core PCE price inflation, which excludes consumer food and energy prices, both increased 1.8 percent over the 12 months ending in Feb- ruary. The trimmed mean measure of 12-month PCE price inflation constructed by the Federal Reserve Bank _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Minutes of the Meeting of April 28–29, 2020 Page 3 of Dallas was 2.0 percent in February. The consumer price index (CPI) rose 1.5 percent over the 12 months ending in March, and the core CPI increased 2.1 percent over the same period. The total CPI rose less than the core CPI mostly because of substantial declines in con- sumer energy prices, which were reflecting significantly lower crude oil prices. Recent readings on survey-based measures of longer-run inflation expectations were little changed on balance. The University of Michigan Sur- veys of Consumers measure for the next 5 to 10 years edged up in April, and the 3-year-ahead measure from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s Survey of Con- sumer Expectations edged down in March; both measures remained in their recent ranges. Real PCE declined steeply in the first quarter of the year. The components of the nominal retail sales data used to estimate PCE, along with the sales of light motor vehi- cles, fell substantially in March, reflecting the effects of the widespread economic shutdowns. Moreover, the consumer sentiment measures from both the Michigan and the Conference Board surveys deteriorated substan- tially over March and April. Real disposable personal income was about flat in the first quarter, so the personal saving rate moved up notably with the decline in spend- ing. In contrast to other sectors of the economy, real resi- dential investment expanded strongly in the first quarter as a whole, although housing-sector activity had started to slow dramatically late in the quarter. Starts and build- ing permit issuance for single-family homes, along with starts of multifamily units, tumbled in March. In addi- tion, sales of both new and existing homes contracted sharply in March, and survey measures of builders’ sen- timent plunged in April. Real business fixed investment slumped in the first quar- ter following moderate declines over the previous three quarters. Spending for business equipment fell consid- erably in the first quarter, led by a sharp decrease in pur- chases of transportation equipment. Business invest- ment in nonresidential structures also dropped notably. The coronavirus outbreak and the effects on economic activity of measures to contain it, together with the as- sociated elevated level of uncertainty, were likely re- flected in recent downbeat readings on business senti- ment in national and regional surveys and appeared to weigh heavily on business investment. In addition, the effects of substantial further declines in crude oil prices were being seen in the falling number of crude oil and natural gas rigs in operation through late April, an indi- cator of business spending on structures in the drilling and mining sector. Total industrial production fell precipitously in March, as the coronavirus outbreak led many factories to close late in the month. The decline in manufacturing output was led by a pullback in the production of motor vehi- cles and related parts. Output in the mining sector— which includes crude oil extraction—also decreased sig- nificantly in the wake of the recent declines in crude oil prices. Total real government purchases only edged up in the first quarter, led by a modest increase in federal pur- chases. State and local purchases were about flat, reflect- ing the effects of public school closures beginning in mid-March. Real exports declined sharply in the first quarter. How- ever, imports declined at a much faster rate so that net exports made a sizable positive contribution to GDP growth. Much of the quarterly decline in trade volumes reflected a sharp drop in March due to weak demand globally and disruptions related to the coronavirus out- break. The fall in exports was concentrated in services, particularly those parts of the sector held down by travel restrictions. Foreign economic activity fell sharply in the first quarter of the year amid widespread mandatory business shut- downs and strict social-distancing measures to contain the spread of the coronavirus outbreak. In China, where lockdowns were first implemented, real GDP contracted sharply in the first quarter, and Canada, Korea, and Sin- gapore also saw substantial declines. Monthly indicators suggested that activity also plummeted in March and April in many other economies, particularly in the euro area and the United Kingdom, which both saw purchas- ing managers indexes fall to record-low levels. Many foreign governments announced large fiscal packages to address the sudden loss of income by firms and house- holds. Many foreign central banks cut policy rates, initi- ated or enhanced credit facilities, relaxed capital require- ments for financial institutions, and ramped up asset purchase programs to alleviate liquidity concerns in for- eign capital markets. Foreign inflation fell steeply, re- flecting large drops in energy prices related to plunging oil prices, while core inflation pressures generally re- mained muted. Page 4 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Staff Review of the Financial Situation In the middle part of March, financial markets experi- enced record declines in the prices of risky assets, wide- spread illiquidity, and elevated volatility, as uncertainty regarding the effects of the coronavirus outbreak on the global economy jumped. However, following the an- nouncement and subsequent launching of a number of Federal Reserve emergency liquidity programs, the pas- sage of the Cares Act (Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Eco- nomic Security Act), and early signs of a decline in out- break intensity in the United States and many major for- eign economies, the extreme volatility and illiquidity sub- sided and prices of most risky assets increased notably. Over the intermeeting period, on net, the S&P 500 index rose, option-implied volatility fell, and Treasury yields declined, while corporate bond spreads widened some- what. Financing conditions for businesses, households, and state and local governments were strained over the intermeeting period. However, the Federal Reserve’s announcements and start-ups of emergency liquidity fa- cilities appeared to improve conditions in many of these markets. These facilities were established with the ap- proval of the Secretary of the Treasury under the author- ity of section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act and were designed to support the flow of credit to businesses, households, and state and local governments. Treasury markets experienced extreme volatility in mid- March, and market liquidity became substantially im- paired as investors sold large volumes of medium- and long-term Treasury securities. Following a period of ex- traordinarily rapid purchases of Treasury securities and agency MBS by the Federal Reserve, Treasury market li- quidity gradually improved through the remainder of the intermeeting period, and Treasury yields became less volatile. Although market depth remained exceptionally low and bid-ask spreads for off-the-run securities and long-term on-the-run securities remained elevated, bid- ask spreads for short-term on-the-run securities fell close to levels seen earlier in the year. Yields on nominal Treasury securities declined across the maturity spec- trum, with the 10- and 30-year yields ending the period near all-time lows. A straight read of market quotes sug- gested that the expected federal funds rate would remain under 25 basis points through 2022. Measures of infla- tion compensation based on Treasury Inflation- Protected Securities (TIPS) ended the period higher, on net, but were still low by historical standards. Inflation compensation fell sharply in the first half of March but subsequently recovered, as overall financial conditions and TIPS liquidity improved. The market for agency MBS also experienced substantial stresses in mid-March, and agency MBS spreads to Treasury yields widened and were volatile. However, market conditions for agency MBS improved significantly in the second half of March, supported by the Federal Reserve’s additional purchases of these securities. Stock price indexes were exceptionally volatile early in the intermeeting period, and one-month option-implied volatility on the S&P 500 index reached a record high. Equity market volatility moved down substantially over the remainder of the intermeeting period but remained elevated, and equity prices more than retraced their ear- lier declines to end the intermeeting period notably higher. Broad stock price index increases over the inter- meeting period were led by the energy, consumer discre- tionary, basic materials, and health-care sectors. Broad equity price indexes remained, however, markedly below peaks registered earlier this year. Corporate bond spreads over comparable-maturity Treasury yields wid- ened sharply in the beginning of the intermeeting period, and they subsequently retraced most of their increases to end up only somewhat higher on net. Corporate bond spreads at the end of the intermeeting period still stood significantly above their levels in January. In short-term funding markets, strains intensified in mid-March. Spreads of yields of term money market in- struments over comparable-maturity overnight index swap rates increased sharply, and issuance of unsecured commercial paper, negotiable certificates of deposit, and short-term municipal debt declined substantially and shifted to very short maturities. Institutional prime money market funds (MMFs) experienced heavy re- demptions and reportedly faced difficulties selling assets amid impaired secondary-market liquidity. The an- nouncements and start-ups of several Federal Reserve emergency liquidity facilities in the second half of March helped stabilize short-term funding markets, and, by the end of the intermeeting period, spreads had narrowed across the board. Repo rates were elevated in mid- March but normalized following the very large inflows of funds into government MMFs, the expansion of the Federal Reserve’s repo operations, and the announce- ment of the PDCF. The effective federal funds rate was at the top of the target range for a few days following the March FOMC meeting and, after declining in the second half of March, stayed at around 5 basis points for most of April. Early in the period, cascading shutdowns in many coun- tries weighed heavily on risk sentiment abroad. Many foreign financial markets experienced severe illiquidity and substantial volatility, and foreign equity indexes _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Minutes of the Meeting of April 28–29, 2020 Page 5 posted large declines. However, extraordinary monetary and fiscal policy actions in the United States and abroad helped improve market sentiment, and most major for- eign equity indexes subsequently rebounded notably. That said, compared with early this year, foreign equity indexes stayed sharply lower, and option-implied equity volatility abroad remained elevated. Advanced-econ- omy sovereign yields were also volatile, but most sover- eign yields ended the period somewhat lower. By the end of the intermeeting period, policy rates in most ma- jor advanced foreign economies (AFEs) were at or near their effective lower bounds. In mid-March, Emerging Market Bond Index (EMBI) spreads widened sharply, and capital outflows from EMEs reached record levels. As global sentiment improved somewhat, those capital outflows slowed and EMBI spreads partially retraced earlier increases. Strong demand for dollars amid flight to safety globally, together with disruptions in U.S. short-term funding markets, caused severe strains in funding markets for dollars abroad, especially early in the intermeeting pe- riod. The premiums paid by investors to borrow dollars using the foreign exchange swap market over the costs of directly borrowing dollars widened sharply as the end of the first quarter approached. FOMC actions, includ- ing several changes to the standing central bank liquidity swap lines and a temporary expansion in the number of central bank counterparties, as well as the announce- ment of the FIMA (Foreign and International Monetary Authorities) Repo Facility, notably improved conditions in the foreign exchange swap market. Nonetheless, con- ditions in this market remained strained. Over the period, the staff’s broad dollar index increased, with the dollar appreciating modestly against AFE cur- rencies and notably against EME currencies. Currencies of vulnerable commodity exporters, such as Mexico and Brazil, depreciated sharply. At the end of the intermeet- ing period, the broad dollar index remained significantly higher than at the beginning of the year. Financing conditions for nonfinancial businesses were strained in March, particularly for lower-rated firms and small businesses. Federal Reserve announcements of fa- cilities to support the flow of credit to businesses, house- holds, and state and local governments appeared to im- prove financing conditions in many markets, although conditions had yet to normalize. Issuance of specula- tive-grade bonds and leveraged loans was extremely low in March but resumed, at a slow pace, in April. Invest- ment-grade issuance, while relatively slow in early March, was robust following the Federal Reserve’s an- nouncements in late March of the Primary Market Cor- porate Credit Facility and the Secondary Market Corpo- rate Credit Facility. Conditions in the market for corpo- rate bonds and loans improved further in response to the Federal Reserve’s announcement in April that it would expand these facilities to include firms that had been recently downgraded to just below investment- grade status. Commercial and industrial (C&I) lending conditions were somewhat tight. Although C&I loans increased strongly, this increase was largely driven by firms draw- ing down existing lines of credit; they reportedly did so to shore up liquidity for precautionary motives and to meet funding needs. In the April Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices (SLOOS), banks reported having tightened their C&I lending standards and terms for firms of all sizes. Credit quality and the earnings outlook of nonfinancial corporations deteriorated substantially, and market analysts forecast a large volume of downgrades of nonfinancial corporate bonds, including a substantial volume from triple-B to speculative grade. Credit conditions for small businesses were tight. Concerns about the finances of state and lo- cal governments contributed to a marked deterioration in credit conditions in the municipal bond market in March. Although strains lessened amid Federal Reserve announcements on emergency lending facilities to sup- port the flow of credit and liquidity to state and local governments—specifically, expansions to the MMLF and the CPFF and the establishment of the Municipal Liquidity Facility—spreads remained high and issuance subdued at the end of the intermeeting period. Financing conditions for commercial real estate (CRE) were strained. Non-agency commercial mortgage- backed securities (CMBS) issuance shut down, although secondary-market spreads narrowed following the ex- tension of the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facil- ity (TALF) to include non-agency CMBS as eligible col- lateral. Meanwhile, agency CMBS issuance continued, supported by the Federal Reserve’s purchases of these securities. Most April SLOOS respondents reported having tightened lending standards for CRE loans. CRE loans on banks’ books increased in the second half of March, in part because banks were unable to securitize some nonresidential loans. Financing conditions in residential mortgage markets were tight for low-rated borrowers and other borrowers who rely on nonconforming mortgages. Many mortgage originators and warehouse lenders announced tighter Page 6 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ underwriting standards on new originations. Despite a considerable widening of the spread between the pri- mary mortgage rate and MBS yields, primary mortgage interest rates were low by historical standards, and avail- able indicators suggested that refinancing activity re- mained elevated. The volume of mortgage rate locks for home-purchase loans dropped materially in early April, reflecting in part declines in homebuyer demand and dis- ruptions in the home search and purchase process. Financing conditions in consumer credit markets tight- ened somewhat on net. Spreads on consumer asset- backed securities jumped in mid-March, and primary- market issuance came to a halt. However, in response to the announcement of the TALF and to diminished broader financial market uncertainty, spreads retraced most of their increase in the early part of the period, and primary-market issuance resumed. Though banks in the April SLOOS reported tightening standards on new consumer loans, respondents also experienced weaker demand for all consumer loan types. Auto loan interest rates dropped sharply in early April as manufacturers in- troduced attractive financing programs to boost sales. The staff assessed the stability of the financial system during the coronavirus outbreak. The banking sector, including the large banks, was resilient coming into this period. Banks were able to meet surging demand for draws on credit lines while also building loan loss re- serves to absorb higher expected defaults. In other parts of the financial system, however, some notable vulnera- bilities that had been identified in previous financial sta- bility assessments exacerbated financial strains. In March, institutional prime MMFs and other institutions relying on unstable funding sources faced significant stress, a situation that put in jeopardy the orderly func- tioning of some financial markets. Federal Reserve ac- tions to enhance the liquidity and functioning of key markets reduced these stresses notably. Open-end mu- tual funds that invest in corporate bonds and loans— institutions that typically face a timing mismatch be- tween investors’ ability to redeem shares and the funds’ ability to sell assets—experienced heavy outflows and li- quidity strains in mid-March. Redemptions later eased, however, amid the general improvement in financial markets. Business debt, which appeared to be high com- pared with fundamentals before the coronavirus out- break, seemed poised to rise further as businesses bor- rowed to maintain their capacity to restart operations. Values of CRE faced the risk of large declines in re- sponse to the coronavirus outbreak, although updated readings were not yet available. The staff provided a pre- liminary reading on potential emerging risks to financial stability in the aftermath of the coronavirus outbreak. This reading highlighted possible vulnerabilities in mort- gage servicers, insurance companies, and large, highly leveraged financial intermediaries. Staff Economic Outlook The projection for the U.S. economy prepared by the staff for the April FOMC meeting was downgraded no- tably from the March meeting forecast in response to information on the spread of the coronavirus and the measures undertaken to contain it both at home and abroad. U.S. real GDP was forecast to plummet and the unemployment rate to soar in the second quarter of this year. The substantial fiscal policy measures and mone- tary policy support that had been put in place were ex- pected to help mitigate the deterioration in economic conditions and help boost the recovery. The staff noted that, importantly, the future perfor- mance of the economy would depend on the evolution of the coronavirus outbreak and the measures under- taken to contain it. Under the staff’s baseline assump- tions that the current restrictions on social interactions and business operations would ease gradually this year, real GDP was forecast to rise appreciably and the unem- ployment rate to decline considerably in the second half of the year, although a complete recovery was not ex- pected by year-end. Inflation was projected to weaken this year, reflecting both the deterioration in resource utilization and sizable expected declines in consumer en- ergy prices. Under the baseline assumptions, economic conditions were projected to continue to improve, and inflation to pick back up, over the next two years. The staff observed that uncertainty regarding the eco- nomic effects of the coronavirus outbreak was extremely elevated and that the historical behavior of the U.S. economy in response to past economic shocks pro- vided limited guidance for making judgments about how the economy might evolve over coming quarters. In light of the significant uncertainty and downside risks as- sociated with the evolution of the coronavirus outbreak, how much the economy would weaken, and how long it would take to recover, the staff judged that a more pes- simistic projection was no less plausible than the baseline forecast. In this scenario, a second wave of the corona- virus outbreak, with another round of strict restrictions on social interactions and business operations, was as- sumed to begin around year-end, inducing a decrease in real GDP, a jump in the unemployment rate, and re- newed downward pressure on inflation next year. Com- pared with the baseline, the disruption to economic ac- tivity was more severe and protracted in this scenario, _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Minutes of the Meeting of April 28–29, 2020 Page 7 with real GDP and inflation lower and the unemploy- ment rate higher by the end of the medium-term projec- tion. Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook Participants noted that the coronavirus outbreak was causing tremendous human and economic hardship across the United States and around the world. The vi- rus and the measures taken to protect public health were inducing sharp declines in economic activity and a surge in job losses. Weaker demand and significantly lower oil prices were holding down consumer price inflation. The disruptions to economic activity here and abroad had significantly affected financial conditions and had im- paired the flow of credit to U.S. households and busi- nesses. Participants judged that the effects of the coronavirus outbreak and the ongoing public health crisis would con- tinue to weigh heavily on economic activity, employ- ment, and inflation in the near term and would pose con- siderable risks to the economic outlook over the me- dium term. Participants assessed that the second quarter would likely see overall economic activity decline at an unprecedented rate. Participants relayed information from their Districts that the burdens of the present crisis would fall disproportionately on the most vulnerable and financially constrained households in the economy. Participants agreed that recently enacted fiscal programs were delivering valuable direct financial aid to house- holds, businesses, and communities that would provide some relief during the economic shutdown. In addition, economic activity was being supported by actions taken by the Federal Reserve, including lending facilities cre- ated under the authority of section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act, some of which included capital allocated by the U.S. Treasury. These programs had helped maintain the flow of credit to households, businesses, and state and local governments, while supporting the smooth functioning of financial markets. Regarding the economic activity of households, partici- pants noted that the pandemic and efforts to mitigate the spread of the disease were having severely adverse ef- fects on aggregate household spending and consumer confidence. Participants reported that consumer spend- ing had plummeted across all parts of the country and in most categories of spending, with especially sharp de- clines in expenditures for categories that had been most affected by social distancing, such as hotel, fuel, air travel, restaurant, theater, and other retail products and services. Participants noted that even after government- imposed social-distancing restrictions came to an end, consumer spending in these categories likely would not return quickly to more normal levels. Survey-based measures of consumer confidence also plunged, a devel- opment that participants and District contacts attributed to households’ concerns regarding the risk of job loss or difficulty in meeting financial obligations. Participants noted that some households experiencing job losses may not immediately face lower total income because of the support from recently enacted fiscal programs. Even in such cases, however, participants observed that house- hold spending would likely be held down by a decrease in confidence and an increase in precautionary saving. Participants noted that business activity and investment spending had also fallen dramatically since the previous meeting as a result of efforts to contain the coronavirus outbreak. Manufacturing output declined sharply in March and was expected by participants to drop even more rapidly in April. In all Districts, some businesses had been forced to close temporarily because of social distancing restrictions. Businesses that were able to re- main open to some degree were also substantially af- fected by the pandemic, with many experiencing either substantial drops in new orders and sales or supply chain disruptions. There were widespread reports from Dis- trict contacts of firms reducing their payrolls and curtail- ing plans for investment spending. Some industries were especially hard hit, including airlines, cruise ships, restau- rants, and tourism. Participants reported that many firms were seeking loans, payment deferrals, or grants to help address critical financial obligations and that the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) was providing val- uable assistance to small businesses in this respect. Par- ticipants also noted the disproportionate burdens or par- ticular challenges being faced by small businesses; these challenges included lower cash buffers, fewer financing options, and, more recently, tighter lending standards. Participants expressed concerns that a large number of small businesses may not be able to endure a shock that had long-lasting financial effects. Participants were fur- ther concerned that even after social-distancing require- ments were eased, some business models may no longer be economically viable, which could occur, for example, if consumers voluntarily continued to avoid participating in particular forms of economic activity. In addition, participants expressed concern that the possibility of secondary outbreaks of the virus may cause businesses for some time to be reluctant to engage in new projects, rehire workers, or make new capital expenditures. Participants observed that conditions in the energy sec- tor had become especially difficult. A sharp reduction Page 8 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ in global demand for petroleum had led to unused sup- ply that was overwhelming storage capacity, resulting in a plunge in oil prices. Some participants expressed con- cern that low energy prices, if they were to persist, had the potential to create a wave of bankruptcies in the en- ergy sector. In addition, the agricultural sector was un- der severe stress due to falling prices for some farm commodities and pandemic-related disruptions, such as the closing of some food processing plants. With regard to the labor market, participants noted that incoming data confirmed that an extreme decline in em- ployment was under way. Nationally, initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits had totaled more than 25 million from mid-March to the time of the meeting, and participants expected that the unemployment rate would soon reach the highest levels of the post–World War II period. District contacts reported that a signifi- cant portion of workers had been able to switch to work- ing remotely. Although many employers were trying to keep workers on their payrolls, over time, as conditions persisted, there had begun to be widespread furloughs and layoffs. Participants were concerned that temporary layoffs could become permanent, and that workers who lose employment could face a loss of job-specific skills or may become discouraged and exit the labor force. Participants were additionally concerned that employees who were on low incomes would be the most severely affected by job cuts because they were employed in the industries most affected by the response to the outbreak or because their jobs were not amenable to being carried out remotely. With regard to inflation, participants noted that it had been running below the Committee’s 2 percent longer- run objective before the coronavirus outbreak. While the pandemic had created some supply constraints, which had generated upward pressure on the prices of some goods, the pandemic had also reduced demand, which had exerted downward pressure on prices. The overall effect of the outbreak on prices was seen as dis- inflationary. In addition, a stronger dollar and lower oil prices were factors likely to put downward pressure on inflation, and market-based measures of inflation com- pensation remained very low. Participants observed that the return of inflation to the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run objective would likely be further delayed but that the accommodative stance of monetary policy would be helpful in achieving the 2 percent inflation ob- jective over the longer run. Participants noted that recently enacted fiscal programs were crucial for limiting the severity of the economic downturn. In particular, the Cares Act and other legis- lation, which represented more than $2 trillion in federal spending in total, had provided direct help to house- holds, businesses, and communities. For example, the PPP was providing a financial lifeline to small busi- nesses, the expansion of unemployment benefits was helping restore lost income for laid-off workers, and the Treasury had provided a necessary financial backstop to many Federal Reserve lending facilities. Participants acknowledged that even greater fiscal support may be necessary if the economic downturn persists. Participants commented that, in addition to weighing heavily on economic activity in the near term, the eco- nomic effects of the pandemic created an extraordinary amount of uncertainty and considerable risks to eco- nomic activity in the medium term. Participants dis- cussed several alternative scenarios with regard to the behavior of economic activity in the medium term that all seemed about equally likely. These scenarios differed in the assumed length of the pandemic and the conse- quent economic disruptions. On the one hand, a num- ber of participants judged that there was a substantial likelihood of additional waves of outbreak in the near or medium term. In such scenarios, it was believed likely that there would be further economic disruptions, in- cluding additional periods of mandatory social distanc- ing, greater supply chain dislocations, and a substantial number of business closures and loss of income; in total, such developments could lead to a protracted period of severely reduced economic activity. On the other hand, economic activity could recover more quickly if the pan- demic subsided enough for households and businesses to become sufficiently confident to relax or modify so- cial-distancing behaviors over the next several months. Beyond these considerations, participants noted the risk that foreign economies, particularly EMEs, could come under extreme pressure as a result of the pandemic and that this strain could spill over to and hamper U.S. eco- nomic activity. Participants stressed that measures taken in the areas of health-care policy and fiscal policy, to- gether with actions by the private sector, would be im- portant in shaping the timing and speed of the U.S. economy’s return to more normal conditions. In addition, participants agreed that recent actions taken by the Federal Reserve were essential in helping reduce downside risks to the economic outlook. Participants also noted several risks to long-term eco- nomic performance that were posed by the pandemic. One of these risks was that workers who lose employ- ment as a result of the pandemic may experience a loss of skills, lose access to adequate childcare or eldercare, _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Minutes of the Meeting of April 28–29, 2020 Page 9 or become discouraged and exit the labor force. The longer-term behavior of firms could be affected as well—for instance, if necessary but costly transmission- mitigation strategies lowered firms’ productivity; if busi- ness investment shifted down permanently; if many firms need to adjust their business models in the after- math of the pandemic; or if business closures, particu- larly those of small firms, became widespread. A few participants noted that higher levels of government in- debtedness, which would be exacerbated by fiscal ex- penditures that were necessary to combat the economic effects of the pandemic, could put downward pressure on growth in aggregate potential output. Regarding developments in financial markets, partici- pants agreed that ongoing actions by the Federal Reserve had been instrumental in easing strains in some essential financial markets and supporting the flow of credit. These actions included large-scale purchases of Treasury securities and agency MBS, measures to reduce strains in global U.S. dollar funding markets, and the launch of programs to support the flow of credit in the economy for households, businesses of all sizes, and state and lo- cal governments. Banks had entered the crisis well cap- italized and had been able to provide necessary credit to businesses and households. A number of participants commented on potential risks to financial stability. Participants were concerned that banks could come under greater stress, particularly if ad- verse scenarios for the spread of the pandemic and eco- nomic activity were realized, and so this sector should be monitored carefully. Participants saw risks to banks and some other financial institutions as exacerbated by high levels of indebtedness among nonfinancial corporations that prevailed before the pandemic; this indebtedness in- creased these firms’ risk of insolvency. The upcoming financial stress tests for banks were seen as important for measuring the ability of large banks to withstand fu- ture downside scenarios. A number of participants em- phasized that regulators should encourage banks to pre- pare for possible downside scenarios by further limiting payouts to shareholders, thereby preserving loss-absorb- ing capital. Indeed, historical loss models might under- state losses in this context. A few participants stressed that the activities of some nonbank financial institutions presented vulnerabilities to the financial system that could worsen in the event of a protracted economic downturn and that these institutions and activities should be monitored closely. In their consideration of monetary policy at this meeting, participants noted that the Federal Reserve was commit- ted to using its full range of tools to support the U.S. economy in this challenging time, thereby promoting its maximum employment and price stability goals. In light of their assessment that the ongoing public health crisis would weigh heavily on economic activity, employment, and inflation in the near term and posed considerable risks to the economic outlook over the medium term, all participants judged that it would be appropriate to main- tain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent. Keeping the target range at the effective lower bound, after quickly reducing it by 150 basis points in March, would continue to provide support to the economy and promote the Committee’s maximum em- ployment and price stability goals. Participants also judged that it would be appropriate to maintain the tar- get range for the federal funds rate at its present level until policymakers were confident that the economy had weathered recent events and was on track to achieve the Committee’s maximum employment and price stability goals. Participants also assessed that it was appropriate for the Federal Reserve to continue to purchase Treasury secu- rities and agency residential-mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) and CMBS in the amounts needed to support smooth market functioning. These open market pur- chases would continue to support the flow of credit to households and businesses and thereby foster the effec- tive transmission of monetary policy to broader financial conditions. In addition, the Desk would continue to of- fer large-scale overnight and term repo operations. Par- ticipants noted that it was important to continue to mon- itor market conditions closely and that the Committee was prepared to adjust its plans as appropriate to support smooth functioning in the markets for these securities. Participants also commented that the multiple lending facilities established by the Federal Reserve under the authority of section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act and, in some cases, involving capital allocated by the Treasury were supporting financial market functioning and the flow of credit to households, businesses of all sizes, and state and local governments. In this way, these emergency lending facilities were intended to help sup- port the economy until pandemic-related credit market disruptions had abated. Several participants commented further that it would be important for the Federal Re- serve to remain ready to adjust these emergency lending facilities as appropriate based on its monitoring of finan- cial market functioning and credit conditions. Page 10 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ While participants agreed that the current stance of monetary policy remained appropriate, they noted that the Committee could, at upcoming meetings, further clarify its intentions with respect to its future monetary policy decisions. Some participants commented that the Committee could make its forward guidance for the path for the federal funds rate more explicit. For example, the Committee could adopt outcome-based forward guidance that would specify macroeconomic out- comes—such as a certain level of the unemployment rate or of the inflation rate—that must be achieved be- fore the Committee would consider raising the target range for the federal funds rate. The Committee could also consider date-based forward guidance that would indicate that the target range could be raised only after a specified amount of time had elapsed. These partici- pants noted that such explicit forms of forward guidance could help ensure that the public’s expectations regard- ing the future conduct of monetary policy continued to reflect the Committee’s intentions. Several participants observed that the completion, most likely later this year, of the monetary policy framework review, together with the announcement of the conclusions arising from the review, would help further clarify the Committee’s in- tentions with respect to its future monetary policy ac- tions. Several participants also remarked that the Com- mittee may need to provide further clarity regarding its intentions for purchases of Treasury securities and agency MBS; these participants noted that, without fur- ther communication on this matter, uncertainty about the evolution of the Federal Reserve’s asset purchases could increase over time. Several participants remarked that a program of ongoing Treasury securities purchases could be used in the future to keep longer-term yields low. A few participants also noted that the balance sheet could be used to reinforce the Committee’s forward guidance regarding the path of the federal funds rate through Federal Reserve purchases of Treasury securi- ties on a scale necessary to keep Treasury yields at short- to medium-term maturities capped at specified levels for a period of time. Committee Policy Action In their discussion of monetary policy for this meeting, members agreed that the coronavirus outbreak was caus- ing tremendous human and economic hardship across the United States and around the world. The virus and the measures taken to protect public health were induc- ing sharp declines in economic activity and a surge in job losses. Consumer price inflation was being held down by weaker demand and significantly lower oil prices. The disruptions to global economic activity had signifi- cantly affected financial conditions and impaired the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses. Mem- bers agreed that the Federal Reserve was committed to using its full range of tools to support the U.S. economy in this challenging time, thereby promoting its maximum employment and price stability goals. Members further concurred that the ongoing public health crisis would weigh heavily on economic activity, employment, and inflation in the near term, and posed considerable downside risks to the economic outlook over the medium term. In light of these developments, members decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent. Members noted that they expected to maintain this target range until they were confident that the economy had weathered recent events and was on track to achieve the Committee’s maximum employment and price stability goals. Members agreed that they would continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the eco- nomic outlook, including information related to public health, as well as global developments and muted infla- tion pressures, and would use the Committee’s tools and act as appropriate to support the economy. In determin- ing the timing and size of future adjustments to the stance of monetary policy, members noted that they would assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to the Committee’s maximum employment ob- jective and its symmetric 2 percent inflation objective. This assessment would take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market condi- tions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation ex- pectations, and readings on financial and international developments. To support the flow of credit to households and busi- nesses, members agreed that it was appropriate for the Federal Reserve to continue to purchase Treasury secu- rities and agency RMBS and CMBS in the amounts needed to support smooth market functioning, thereby fostering effective transmission of monetary policy to broader financial conditions. In addition, the Desk would continue to offer large-scale overnight and term repo operations. Members agreed that they would closely monitor market conditions and be prepared to adjust their plans as appropriate. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the fol- lowing domestic policy directive, for release at 2:00 p.m.: _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Minutes of the Meeting of April 28–29, 2020 Page 11 “Effective April 30, 2020, the Federal Open Market Committee directs the Desk to: • Undertake open market operations as nec- essary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of 0 to ¼ percent. • Increase the System Open Market Account holdings of Treasury securities, agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS), and agency commercial mortgage-backed secu- rities (CMBS) in the amounts needed to support the smooth functioning of markets for these securities. • Conduct term and overnight repurchase agreement operations to support effective policy implementation and the smooth functioning of short-term U.S. dollar fund- ing markets. • Conduct overnight reverse repurchase agreement operations at an offering rate of 0.00 percent and with a per-counterparty limit of $30 billion per day; the per-counter- party limit can be temporarily increased at the discretion of the Chair. • Roll over at auction all principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of Treasury securities and reinvest all principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s hold- ings of agency debt and agency MBS in agency MBS and all principal payments from holdings of agency CMBS in agency CMBS. • Engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settle- ment of the Federal Reserve’s agency MBS transactions.” The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below for release at 2:00 p.m.: “The Federal Reserve is committed to using its full range of tools to support the U.S. economy in this challenging time, thereby promoting its maximum employment and price stability goals. The coronavirus outbreak is causing tremen- dous human and economic hardship across the United States and around the world. The virus and the measures taken to protect public health are inducing sharp declines in economic activity and a surge in job losses. Weaker demand and significantly lower oil prices are holding down consumer price inflation. The disruptions to economic activity here and abroad have signifi- cantly affected financial conditions and have impaired the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses. The ongoing public health crisis will weigh heavily on economic activity, employment, and inflation in the near term, and poses considera- ble risks to the economic outlook over the me- dium term. In light of these developments, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent. The Committee expects to maintain this target range until it is confident that the economy has weath- ered recent events and is on track to achieve its maximum employment and price stability goals. The Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook, including information re- lated to public health, as well as global develop- ments and muted inflation pressures, and will use its tools and act as appropriate to support the economy. In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the stance of mon- etary policy, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its sym- metric 2 percent inflation objective. This as- sessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor mar- ket conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on fi- nancial and international developments. To support the flow of credit to households and businesses, the Federal Reserve will continue to purchase Treasury securities and agency resi- dential and commercial mortgage-backed secu- rities in the amounts needed to support smooth market functioning, thereby fostering effective transmission of monetary policy to broader fi- nancial conditions. In addition, the Open Mar- ket Desk will continue to offer large-scale over- night and term repurchase agreement opera- tions. The Committee will closely monitor mar- ket conditions and is prepared to adjust its plans as appropriate.” Voting for this action: Jerome H. Powell, John C. Williams, Michelle W. Bowman, Lael Brainard, Richard H. Clarida, Patrick Harker, Robert S. Kaplan, Neel Kashkari, Loretta J. Mester, and Randal K. Quarles. Page 12 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Voting against this action: None. Consistent with the Committee’s decision to leave the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged, the Board of Governors voted unanimously to leave the in- terest rates on required and excess reserve balances at 0.10 percent. The Board of Governors also voted unan- imously to approve establishment of the primary credit rate at the existing level of 0.25 percent, effective April 30, 2020. It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Tuesday–Wednesday, June 9–10, 2020. The meeting adjourned at 10:10 a.m. on April 29, 2020. Notation Votes To address intensifying strains in global financial mar- kets early in the intermeeting period, the Committee unanimously approved the following measures to help maintain the flow of credit to U.S. households and busi- nesses: • By notation vote concluded on March 19, the Com- mittee approved amendments to the Authorization for Foreign Currency Operations (“Foreign Author- ization”) and to the Foreign Currency Directive (“Foreign Directive”).3 The Foreign Authorization amendments authorized the establishment of tem- porary U.S. dollar liquidity arrangements (swap lines). The Foreign Directive was amended to direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to establish and maintain temporary dollar liquidity arrange- ments with the Reserve Bank of Australia, the Banco Central do Brasil, the Danmarks National- bank (Denmark), the Bank of Korea, the Banco de Mexico, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, the Norges Bank (Norway), the Monetary Authority of Singapore, and the Sveriges Riksbank (Sweden). These arrangements will be in place for at least six months. Like the Federal Reserve’s standing U.S. dollar liquidity swap lines with the Bank of Canada, the Bank of England, the Bank of Japan, the Euro- pean Central Bank, and the Swiss National Bank, these temporary arrangements should help lessen heightened strains in global U.S. dollar funding mar- kets, thereby mitigating the effects of these strains on the supply of credit to U.S. households and busi- nesses. • By notation vote concluded on March 23, the Com- mittee approved a statement indicating that the Fed- eral Reserve will continue to purchase Treasury se- curities and agency MBS in the amounts needed to support smooth market functioning and effective transmission of monetary policy to broader financial conditions and that these purchases will include agency CMBS. In conjunction with approval of the statement, the Committee also authorized and di- rected the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to execute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with these planned purchases. Previously, the Com- mittee had announced that it would purchase at least $500 billion of Treasury securities and at least $200 billion of agency MBS. • By notation vote concluded on March 31, the Com- mittee amended the Authorization for Domestic Open Market Operations to authorize, and adopted a resolution to approve, the establishment of a tem- porary repo facility for foreign and international monetary authorities (FIMA Repo Facility).3 The facility will be in place for at least six months and will allow FIMA account holders to temporarily ex- change their U.S. Treasury securities held with the Federal Reserve for U.S. dollars, which can then be made available to institutions in their jurisdictions. By providing foreign and international monetary au- thorities with an alternative temporary source of U.S. dollars other than sales of securities in the open market, the facility should help support the smooth functioning of the U.S. Treasury market. In addi- tion, the FIMA Repo Facility should—along with the U.S. dollar liquidity swap lines the Federal Re- serve has established with other central banks—help ease strains in global U.S. dollar funding markets. By notation vote completed on April 7, 2020, the Com- mittee unanimously approved the minutes of the Com- mittee meeting held on March 15, 2020. _______________________ James A.

Injustice, prejudice, and the callous dis- regard for life had led to social unrest and a sense of des- pair. The Chair noted that it was incumbent upon the leaders of the Federal Reserve System to continue to communicate with force and clarity about the Federal Reserve’s core values, and to reaffirm its unflinching commitment to those values in pursuing the Federal Re- serve’s mandated goals. In that spirit, the Chair noted that he intended to offer the following remarks at the 6 Attended from the discussion of economic developments and the outlook through the end of Tuesday’s session. Page 2 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ end of the postmeeting press conference. All partici- pants supported the statement affirming the Federal Re- serve’s core values and its commitment to do everything it can to foster racial equality as well as diversity and in- clusion both within the Federal Reserve System and in society more broadly. I want to acknowledge the tragic events that have again put a spotlight on the pain of racial injustice in this country. The Federal Reserve serves the entire nation. We operate in, and are part of, many of the communities across the country where Americans are grappling with and expressing themselves on issues of racial equality. I speak for my colleagues throughout the Fed- eral Reserve System when I say that there is no place at the Federal Reserve for racism, and there should be no place for it in our society. Everyone deserves the opportunity to partici- pate fully in our society and in our economy. These foundational principles guide us in all we do, from monetary policy to our focus on diver- sity and inclusion in our workplace, and to our work regulating and supervising banks to ensure fair access to credit around the country. We will take this opportunity to renew our steadfast commitment to these principles, making sure that we are playing our part. We understand that the work of the Federal Re- serve touches communities, families, and busi- nesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We are com- mitted to using our full range of tools to support the economy and to help assure that the recov- ery from this difficult period will be as robust as possible. Discussion of Forward Guidance, Asset Purchases, and Yield Curve Caps or Targets Participants discussed tools for conducting monetary policy when the federal funds rate is at its effective lower bound (ELB). The discussion addressed two topics: (1) the roles of forward guidance and large-scale asset purchase programs in supporting the attainment of the Committee’s maximum-employment and price-stability goals and (2) in light of the foreign and historical expe- rience with approaches that cap or target interest rates along the yield curve, whether such approaches could be used to support forward guidance and complement asset purchase programs. The staff briefing on the first topic focused on outcome-based forward guidance for the federal funds rate—which ties changes in the target range for the federal funds rate to the achievement of specified macroeconomic outcomes, such as reaching a given level of the unemployment rate or inflation—and asset purchase programs of the kind used during and fol- lowing the previous recession. The staff presented re- sults from model simulations that suggested that for- ward guidance and large-scale asset purchases can help support the labor market recovery and the return of in- flation to the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent inflation goal. The simulations suggested that the Committee would have to maintain highly accommodative financial conditions for many years to quicken meaningfully the recovery from the current severe downturn. The brief- ing addressed factors that might alter the potency of for- ward guidance and asset purchase programs, along with a number of considerations for the design of these ac- tions. The staff cautioned that businesses and house- holds might not be as forward looking as assumed in the model simulations, which could reduce the effectiveness of policies that are predicated on influencing expecta- tions about the path of policy several years into the fu- ture. Alternatively, prompt and forceful policy actions by the Committee might help focus the public’s expec- tations around better outcomes or reduce perceived risks of worst-case scenarios, which could generate more im- mediate macroeconomic benefits than those featured in the staff analysis. The second staff briefing reviewed the yield caps or tar- gets (YCT) policies that the Federal Reserve followed during and after World War II and that the Bank of Ja- pan and the Reserve Bank of Australia are currently em- ploying. These three experiences illustrated different types of YCT policies: During World War II, the Fed- eral Reserve capped yields across the curve to keep Treasury borrowing costs low and stable; since 2016, the Bank of Japan has targeted the 10-year yield to continue to provide accommodation while limiting the potential for an excessive flattening of the yield curve; and, since March 2020, the Reserve Bank of Australia has targeted the three-year yield, a target that is intended to reinforce the bank’s forward guidance for its policy rate and to in- fluence funding rates across much of the Australian economy. The staff noted that these three experiences suggested that credible YCT policies can control govern- ment bond yields, pass through to private rates, and, in the absence of exit considerations, may not require large central bank purchases of government debt. But the staff also highlighted the potential for YCT policies to require the central bank to purchase very sizable Minutes of the Meeting of June 9–10, 2020 Page 3 _____________________________________________________________________________________________ amounts of government debt under certain circum- stances—a potential that was realized in the U.S. experi- ence in the 1940s—and the possibility that, under YCT policies, monetary policy goals might come in conflict with public debt management goals, which could pose risks to the independence of the central bank. In their discussion of forward guidance and large-scale asset purchases, participants agreed that the Committee has had extensive experience with these tools, that they were effective in the wake of the previous recession, that they have become key parts of the monetary policy toolkit, and that, as a result, they have important roles to play in supporting the attainment of the Committee’s maximum-employment and price-stability goals. Vari- ous participants noted that the economy is likely to need support from highly accommodative monetary policy for some time and that it will be important in coming months for the Committee to provide greater clarity re- garding the likely path of the federal funds rate and asset purchases. Participants generally indicated support for outcome-based forward guidance. A number of partici- pants spoke favorably of forward guidance tied to infla- tion outcomes that could possibly entail a modest tem- porary overshooting of the Committee’s longer-run in- flation goal but where inflation fluctuations would be centered on 2 percent over time. They saw this form of forward guidance as helping reinforce the credibility of the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent inflation objective and potentially preventing a premature withdrawal of monetary policy accommodation. A couple of partici- pants signaled a preference for forward guidance tied to the unemployment rate, noting that it would be more credible to focus on labor market outcomes that have been achieved in the recent past or that—given how high the unemployment rate currently is—such guidance would clearly signal a high degree of accommodation for an extended period. A few others suggested that calendar-based guidance—which specifies a date beyond which accommodation could start to be reduced—might be at least as effective as outcome-based guidance. They noted that calendar-based guidance had been very effec- tive when the Committee used it in 2011 and 2012 or that it would be very challenging to provide credible out- come-based guidance in light of the substantial uncer- tainty surrounding the current economic outlook. Re- gardless of the specific form of forward guidance, a cou- ple of participants expressed the concern that policies that effectively committed the Committee to maintain- ing very low interest rates for a long time could ulti- mately pose significant risks to financial stability. Participants agreed that asset purchase programs can promote accommodative financial conditions by putting downward pressure on term premiums and longer-term yields. Several participants remarked that declines in the neutral rate of interest and in term premiums over the past decade and prevailing low levels of longer-term yields would likely act as constraints on the effectiveness of asset purchases in the current environment and noted that these constraints were not as acute when the Com- mittee implemented such programs in the wake of the Global Financial Crisis. These participants noted, how- ever, that large-scale asset purchases could still be bene- ficial under current circumstances by offsetting potential upward pressures on longer-term yields or by helping re- inforce the Committee’s commitment to maintaining highly accommodative financial conditions. A few par- ticipants questioned the desirability of large-scale asset purchases following the current purchases to support market functioning, noting that they likely would lead to a further considerable expansion of the Federal Re- serve’s balance sheet or have potentially adverse impli- cations for financial stability. In their discussion of the foreign and historical experi- ence with YCT policies and the potential role for such policies in the United States, nearly all participants indi- cated that they had many questions regarding the costs and benefits of such an approach. Among the three ep- isodes discussed in the staff presentation, participants generally saw the Australian experience as most relevant for current circumstances in the United States. None- theless, many participants remarked that, as long as the Committee’s forward guidance remained credible on its own, it was not clear that there would be a need for the Committee to reinforce its forward guidance with the adoption of a YCT policy. In addition, participants raised a number of concerns related to the implementa- tion of YCT policies, including how to maintain control of the size and composition of the Federal Reserve’s bal- ance sheet, particularly as the time to exit from such pol- icies nears; how to combine YCT policies—which at least in the Australian case incorporate aspects of date- based forward guidance—with the types of outcome- based forward guidance that many participants favored; how to mitigate the risks that YCT policies pose to cen- tral bank independence; and how to assess the effects of these policies on financial market functioning and the size and composition of private-sector balance sheets. A number of participants commented on additional chal- lenges associated with YCT policies focused on the longer portion of the yield curve, including how these policies might interact with large-scale asset purchase Page 4 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ programs and the extent of additional accommodation they would provide in the current environment of very low interest rates. Some of these participants also noted that longer-term yields are importantly influenced by factors such as longer-run inflation expectations and the longer-run neutral real interest rate and that changes in these factors or difficulties in estimating them could re- sult in the central bank inadvertently setting yield caps or targets at inappropriate levels. A couple of participants remarked that an appropriately designed YCT policy that focused on the short-to-medium part of the yield curve could serve as a powerful commitment device for the Committee. These participants noted that, even if mar- ket participants currently expect the federal funds rate to remain at its ELB through the medium term, the intro- duction of an effective YCT policy could help prevent those expectations from changing prematurely—as hap- pened during the previous recovery—or that the size of a large-scale asset purchase program, which also poses risks to central bank independence, could be reduced by an effective YCT policy. All participants agreed that it would be useful for the staff to conduct further analysis of the design and implementation of YCT policies as well as of their likely economic and financial effects. A number of participants emphasized that, when as- sessing the potential roles that different monetary policy tools might play to support the attainment of the Com- mittee’s goals, it was important to think about how var- ious policy tools could be used in coordination as part of the Committee’s overall strategy to achieve its dual- mandate objectives. In addition, various participants noted that clear communications with the public are cen- tral to the efficacy of all policy tools and that, therefore, the Committee should complete its monetary policy framework review in the near term, including revising the Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Pol- icy Strategy. Such a revised statement would communi- cate to the public how the Committee views its policy goals and provide additional context to the Committee’s policy actions. Developments in Financial Markets and Open Mar- ket Operations The System Open Market Account (SOMA) manager first discussed developments in financial markets over the intermeeting period. Risk asset prices were buoyed by optimism about the potential for increased economic activity associated with reopenings as parts of the United States and other countries relaxed lockdown restrictions. That optimism was reinforced by high-frequency data suggesting a pickup in economic activity. Market partic- ipants also pointed to the suite of U.S. and global policy measures taken since mid-March as laying a foundation for the improvement in risk sentiment. Against this backdrop, staff analysis suggested that equity prices had been supported by expectations for a strong rebound in earnings next year, low risk-free rates and positive risk sentiment. Despite this improvement in risk sentiment, market participants expected weak overall growth in 2020, and elevated uncertainties in the outlook re- mained. The manager noted that prospects for adverse developments regarding the coronavirus (COVID-19) and the potential for financial strains to amplify reces- sionary dynamics, and geopolitical developments, in- cluding renewed U.S.–China tensions, presented near term risks to financial markets. Market participants were also attentive to the recent steepening in the Treasury yield curve and noted a range of uncertainties in the out- look for longer-term rates. Regarding expectations for monetary policy, respond- ents to the Open Market Trading Desk’s surveys sug- gested that most market participants did not anticipate policy changes at the June meeting. The target range for the federal funds rate was expected to remain at the ELB for at least the next couple of years, although many sur- vey respondents attached some probability to the target range increasing in 2022. Although the rates implied by federal funds futures contracts settling next year had fallen to slightly negative levels in May, survey respond- ents attached very little probability to the possibility of negative policy rates. The manager turned to a discussion of Federal Reserve operations. Credit facilities, some of which became op- erational over the period, generally experienced modest activity in light of broad improvements in credit market conditions. New usage across many funding operations and facilities had declined over the intermeeting period as conditions in funding markets improved. The man- ager noted that a significant proportion of amounts out- standing under U.S. dollar liquidity swaps and repur- chase agreements (repo) reflected term transactions ini- tiated during the period of funding market strains. In light of the improvement in funding market conditions, the manager noted that it might be appropriate to make a modest adjustment to the minimum bid rates on repo operations in the forthcoming calendar, which would ef- fectively position these operations in a backstop role. These adjustments were not expected to have any signif- icant effects in short-term funding markets. Finally, the manager discussed the near-term plans for purchases of Treasury securities and agency mortgage- backed securities (MBS). Overall, functioning in the Minutes of the Meeting of June 9–10, 2020 Page 5 _____________________________________________________________________________________________ markets for these securities had improved substantially. In light of these improvements, the Desk had gradually reduced the pace of purchases over the intermeeting pe- riod, to their current levels of $4 billion per day in Treas- ury securities and $4.5 billion per day in agency MBS. These purchase amounts were significantly lower than the peak pace in mid-March and roughly corresponded to monthly increases in SOMA holdings of approxi- mately $80 billion in Treasury securities and $40 billion in agency MBS. Continuing to increase holdings at this pace would likely help sustain the improvements in mar- ket functioning, and seemed to be roughly in line with market expectations for Treasury purchases, and toward the lower end of expectations for agency MBS pur- chases, net of reinvestments. In addition, principal pay- ments from agency debt and agency MBS held in the SOMA portfolio could continue to be reinvested in agency MBS. Weekly operations in agency commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) would also be con- ducted. The Desk was prepared to increase the size or adjust the composition of Treasury, agency MBS and agency CMBS purchases as needed to sustain smooth market functioning in the markets for these securities. By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk’s domestic transactions over the intermeeting period. There were no intervention operations in foreign curren- cies for the System’s account during the intermeeting pe- riod. Staff Review of the Economic Situation The coronavirus outbreak and the measures undertaken to contain its spread were severely disrupting economic activity in the United States and abroad. The available information for the June 9–10 meeting suggested that U.S. real gross domestic product (GDP) would likely post a historically large decline in the second quarter. Labor market conditions improved in May, but these im- provements were modest relative to the substantial de- terioration seen over the previous two months. Con- sumer price inflation, as measured by the 12-month per- centage change in the price index for personal consump- tion expenditures (PCE), slowed notably through April, reflecting the effects of both weak aggregate demand and low energy prices. Total nonfarm payroll employment expanded strongly in May, though by much less than the historic job losses recorded in April. The unemployment rate moved down to 13.3 percent in May after soaring to 14.7 percent in April. As was highlighted by the Bureau of Labor Sta- tistics, these figures likely understated the extent of un- employment; accounting for the unusually large number of workers who reported themselves as employed but absent from their jobs would have raised the unemploy- ment rate by 5 percentage points in April and 3 percent- age points in May. Both the labor force participation rate and the employment-to-population ratio increased in May. Initial claims for unemployment insurance ben- efits had declined through the last week of May from their peak in late March, but they still were at a histori- cally elevated level. Average hourly earnings for all em- ployees declined in May after rising sharply in April, but these fluctuations largely reflected the substantial changes in the level and composition of employment, which disproportionately affected lower-wage workers. The employment cost index for total labor compensa- tion in the private sector increased 2.8 percent over the 12 months ending in March—a period mostly predating the onset of the pandemic—and was the same as its year- earlier pace. Total PCE price inflation was only 0.5 percent over the 12 months ending in April, reflecting both weak aggre- gate demand in recent months and a considerable drop in consumer energy prices. Prices fell in March and April in many categories that were affected the most by social-distancing measures, such as the prices for air travel and hotel accommodations. Core PCE price in- flation, which excludes changes in consumer food and energy prices, was 1.0 percent over the 12 months end- ing in April. In contrast, the trimmed mean measure of 12-month PCE price inflation constructed by the Fed- eral Reserve Bank of Dallas was 1.9 percent in April. The consumer price index (CPI) inched up 0.1 percent over the 12 months ending in May, while core CPI infla- tion was 1.2 percent over the same period. Recent read- ings on survey-based measures of longer-run inflation expectations were little changed on balance. The Uni- versity of Michigan Surveys of Consumers measure for the next 5 to 10 years edged up in May, while the 3-year- ahead measure from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s Survey of Consumer Expectations was un- changed. The 10-year measure for PCE price inflation from the Survey of Professional Forecasters ticked down in the second quarter. All of these measures of longer- run inflation expectations continued to be near their re- cent ranges. Real PCE slumped in April, with declines widespread across most spending categories. In May, however, light motor vehicle sales and some other high-frequency indi- cators of consumer spending turned up, but the levels of these indicators were mostly still below their levels early in the year. Real disposable personal income increased significantly in April, as a marked decline in wage and Page 6 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ salary income was more than offset by a substantial boost from government transfer payments due to recent fiscal policy support; as a result, the personal saving rate soared. The consumer sentiment measures from both the Michigan survey and the Conference Board survey crept up in May but remained below their levels early in the year. Real residential investment appeared to be weakening significantly in the second quarter. Starts and building permit issuance for single-family homes, along with starts of multifamily units, dropped sharply in April. Sales of existing homes contracted markedly in April, al- though new home sales edged up. Real business fixed investment continued to tumble in the second quarter. Nominal new orders and shipments of nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft decreased considerably in April. Nominal business spending for nonresidential structures outside of the drilling and min- ing sector also fell in April. In addition, the effects of low crude oil prices were evident in further declines in the number of crude oil and natural gas rigs in operation through early June, an indicator of business spending on structures in the drilling and mining sector. Total industrial production plunged in April, as many factories slowed or suspended operation in response to the coronavirus pandemic. The decline in manufactur- ing production was widespread across all major indus- tries and was led by a collapse in the output of motor vehicles and related parts. Output in the mining sec- tor—which includes crude oil extraction—also de- creased, reflecting the effects of low crude oil prices. Total real government purchases appeared to be rising moderately in the second quarter. Federal defense spending continued to increase in April, and nondefense purchases were likely to be boosted in the second quar- ter by recent fiscal policy measures related to the coro- navirus. In contrast, state and local purchases looked to be declining, as the payrolls of these governments shrank in April and May, and nominal state and local construc- tion expenditures decreased in April. The nominal U.S. international trade deficit widened in both March and April, as exports of goods and services plunged more than imports. The fall in goods exports was broad based, with particularly sharp declines in au- tomotive products, industrial supplies, and capital goods. Goods imports also contracted significantly in most categories through April, and a near halt of inter- national travel drove a steep decline in exports and im- ports of services. Foreign economic activity contracted in the first quarter, even though most countries abroad introduced strict social-distancing measures to contain the spread of the coronavirus only toward the end of the quarter. In China, where restrictions were largely lifted by the end of the first quarter, data pointed to a relatively quick re- bound in economic activity in the second quarter. Out- side of China, indicators suggested that foreign eco- nomic activity plummeted further in the second quarter, notwithstanding some signs of improvement in May as restrictions started to ease. Inflation rates fell sharply across most foreign economies in April and May. The low level of oil prices relative to a year ago contributed to 12-month inflation rates close to or below zero in many advanced foreign economies (AFEs). Staff Review of the Financial Situation Over the intermeeting period, risk sentiment improved, on net, as optimism over reopening the economy, po- tential coronavirus treatments, the unexpectedly positive May employment situation report, and other indicators that suggest that economic activity may be rebounding more than offset concerns arising from otherwise dire economic data releases, warnings from health experts that openings may have been premature, and renewed tensions between the United States and China. Equity prices rose, and corporate bond spreads narrowed nota- bly. The Treasury yield curve steepened, and the market- implied expected path of the federal funds rate declined somewhat. Liquidity conditions continued to improve in general, but some stress was still evident in several markets. Financing conditions were still somewhat strained for lower-rated borrowers and small businesses even as announcements and implementation of Federal Reserve facilities during the intermeeting period were supportive of credit flows. The credit quality of busi- nesses and municipal debt weakened. The expected path of the federal funds rate for the next few years, based on a straight read of overnight index swap quotes, declined a bit and remained close to the ELB through late 2023. Market-implied forward rates referring to 2021 and 2022 turned slightly negative for a few days beginning on May 7, though market commen- tary suggested that this development did not reflect in- vestors expecting the FOMC to lower the federal funds rate target range below zero. This view was supported by Federal Reserve communications that negative inter- est rates did not appear to be an attractive policy tool. The Treasury yield curve steepened over the intermeet- ing period, with 2-year yields little changed while 10- and 30-year yields rose. Longer-term yields were likely Minutes of the Meeting of June 9–10, 2020 Page 7 _____________________________________________________________________________________________ boosted by expectations of heavy upcoming Treasury se- curity issuance as well as some unwinding of safe-haven demands in connection with improved investor senti- ment. The Treasury’s first 20-year bond offering since 1986 was met with solid demand. Changes in inflation compensation based on Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities yields were mixed; 5-year inflation compensa- tion rose amid the recent partial rebound in crude oil prices, while the 5-to-10-year measure edged down. At the end of the intermeeting period, both measures stood roughly halfway between their mid-March lows and typ- ical levels seen in recent years. Broad stock price indexes moved higher. One-month implied volatility on the S&P 500 index declined some- what but still stood at the 85th percentile of its distribu- tion since 1990. Spreads on investment- and speculative-grade corporate bonds over comparable- maturity Treasury yields narrowed considerably but re- mained at levels similar to those in other periods of no- table economic or bond market stress, though well be- low financial crisis levels. Over the intermeeting period, financial market function- ing appeared to improve in general, although progress was uneven. Liquidity measures improved in the Treas- ury market, but off-the-run Treasury securities of all ten- ors and longer-maturity on-the-run securities remained less liquid than before the onset of the pandemic. Agency MBS market functioning had largely recovered, except for some less liquid parts of the market. Corpo- rate bond market liquidity improved considerably but re- mained somewhat strained, particularly for speculative- grade bonds. Liquidity in the municipal bond markets was still below pre-pandemic levels. Conditions in unsecured short-term funding markets continued to improve over the intermeeting period, and spreads on most types of commercial paper and negotia- ble certificates of deposit narrowed to levels that ap- proached pre-pandemic ranges. Amid better market conditions, take-up in the emergency liquidity facilities declined substantially. Heavy demand for Treasury bills from money market funds held down rates despite an unprecedented pace of issuance. The effective federal funds rate was 5 basis points almost every day over the intermeeting period, and the Secured Overnight Financ- ing Rate averaged 4 basis points. Total outstanding Fed- eral Reserve repos averaged about $170 billion. Amid improving market functioning, Federal Reserve pur- chases of Treasury securities and agency MBS were re- duced from around $10 billion and $8 billion per day, respectively, to $4 billion and $4.5 billion per day, re- spectively, over the intermeeting period. Risk sentiment in foreign financial markets improved over the intermeeting period. Further monetary policy and fiscal policy support in foreign countries, the easing of coronavirus-related restrictions, and a stronger-than- expected U.S. May employment report outweighed con- cerns about otherwise weak global economic data and the resurgence of U.S.–China tensions. Liquidity in global dollar funding markets continued to improve, helped in part by the Federal Reserve’s liquidity pro- grams, and prices of foreign risky assets increased. In the AFEs, option-implied volatility measures declined and long-term sovereign bond yields rose moderately, while fiscal stimulus in Japan and Europe boosted prices in their respective equity markets. Euro-area peripheral bond spreads narrowed after the European Commission proposed that the European Union be given the author- ity to borrow €750 billion to assist the recovery and the European Central Bank (ECB) increased the size of its Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme. In emerg- ing markets, the rise in oil prices since late April and overall improvements in investor sentiment boosted as- set prices, even as the coronavirus outbreak worsened in some countries. Outflows from emerging market funds slowed and then turned into small inflows later in the period. The improving risk sentiment also supported several foreign currencies, and the staff’s broad dollar index fell. The euro appreciated notably over the period, lifted in part by the European fiscal and monetary policy com- munications. The recent rebound in oil prices contrib- uted to a strong appreciation of the Canadian dollar, the Brazilian real, and the Mexican peso. Financing conditions for nonfinancial firms eased some- what over the intermeeting period, though they re- mained moderately strained for lower-rated borrowers. Investment-grade corporate bond issuance soared to record levels in April and remained robust in May, as is- suers took advantage of more favorable market condi- tions following Federal Reserve announcements of two facilities to support corporate credit markets. Regarding these facilities, the Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facility began in mid-May to purchase exchange-traded funds whose investment objective is to provide broad exposure to the market for U.S. corporate bonds. Speculative-grade corporate bond issuance picked up considerably toward the end of April from very low lev- els, though it slowed somewhat in May. Commercial and industrial loans on banks’ books surged again in April, Page 8 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ largely driven by lending through the Paycheck Protec- tion Program (PPP), especially at smaller banks. Credit- line drawdowns continued in April and May, though drawdowns by large firms slowed considerably from rec- ord levels in March. The credit quality of nonfinancial corporations contin- ued to deteriorate sharply during the intermeeting pe- riod. The volume of nonfinancial corporate bond and leveraged loan downgrades remained very high in April and May. Defaults in corporate bonds and leveraged loans increased as well; market analysts projected de- faults to increase considerably over the remainder of 2020 and into 2021. Financing conditions for small businesses tightened amid widespread continued pandemic-related closures and reduced operations of small businesses. Lenders in- dicated that they had tightened loan standards on small business loans or discontinued lending to such borrow- ers altogether (other than PPP loans). Financing condi- tions for state and local governments improved moder- ately following several Federal Reserve announcements to support the municipal debt market, but conditions re- mained somewhat strained for lower-rated states and municipalities. In the first week of June, the State of Il- linois became the first to use the Municipal Liquidity Fa- cility. Commercial real estate (CRE) lending conditions recov- ered somewhat during the intermeeting period. Spreads on triple-A-rated and triple-B-rated non-agency CMBS declined in May but remained elevated relative to before the pandemic, and issuance showed signs of recovery in late April and early May. Federal Reserve purchases of agency CMBS reportedly helped return spreads on these securities to their pre-pandemic levels, and issuance in that market continued to be strong. However, early signs of credit repayment difficulties emerged in some CRE sectors. The volume of mortgage rate locks for home-purchase loans picked up in mid-May following a material drop in April. Financing conditions remained tight for borrow- ers with relatively low credit scores and for those seeking nonconforming mortgages. In addition, options for home equity extraction continued to be restricted, as credit for both home equity lines of credit and cash-out refinances was limited. Servicers were able to handle the liquidity strains imposed by forbearance. The sharp decline in economic activity had also curtailed the demand for consumer credit. On balance, consumer credit financing conditions did not appear to be a major drag on household spending. Issuance of consumer asset-backed securities resumed in mid-April and in early May but remained significantly below pre-pandemic lev- els. Staff Economic Outlook The projection for the U.S. economy prepared by the staff for the June FOMC meeting was downgraded, on balance, as compared with the April meeting forecast in response to information on the spread of the corona- virus and changes in the measures undertaken to contain it both at home and abroad, along with incoming eco- nomic data. U.S. real GDP was forecast to show a his- torically large decline in the second quarter of this year, and the unemployment rate was expected to be sharply higher than in the first quarter. The substantial fiscal policy measures and appreciable support from monetary policy, along with the Federal Reserve’s liquidity and lending facilities, were expected to help mitigate the de- terioration in current economic conditions and to help boost the recovery. The staff continued to judge that the future performance of the economy would depend importantly on the evo- lution of the coronavirus outbreak and the measures un- dertaken to contain it. Under the staff’s baseline as- sumptions that the current restrictions on social interac- tions and business operations would continue to ease gradually this year, real GDP was forecast to rise appre- ciably and the unemployment rate to decline considera- bly in the second half of the year, although a complete recovery was not expected by year-end. Inflation was projected to weaken this year, reflecting both the deteri- oration in resource utilization and sizable expected de- clines in consumer energy prices. Under the baseline as- sumptions, economic conditions were projected to con- tinue to improve, and inflation to pick back up, over the next two years. The staff still observed that the uncertainty related to the economic effects of the coronavirus pandemic was ex- tremely elevated and that the historical behavior of the U.S. economy in response to past economic shocks pro- vided limited guidance for making judgments about how the economy might evolve in the future. In light of the significant uncertainty and downside risks associated with the pandemic, including how much the economy would weaken and how long it would take to recover, the staff judged that a more pessimistic projection was no less plausible than the baseline forecast. In this sce- nario, a second wave of the coronavirus outbreak, with another round of strict limitations on social interactions and business operations, was assumed to begin later this Minutes of the Meeting of June 9–10, 2020 Page 9 _____________________________________________________________________________________________ year, leading to a decrease in real GDP, a jump in the unemployment rate, and renewed downward pressure on inflation next year. Compared with the baseline, the disruption to economic activity was more severe and protracted in this scenario, with real GDP and inflation lower and the unemployment rate higher by the end of the medium-term projection. Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, participants submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and infla- tion for each year from 2020 through 2022 and over the longer run, based on their individual assessments of ap- propriate monetary policy—including the path for the federal funds rate. The longer-run projections repre- sented each participant’s assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy. These projections are described in the Summary of Economic Projections, which is an addendum to these minutes. Participants noted that the coronavirus outbreak was causing tremendous human and economic hardship across the United States and around the world. The vi- rus and the measures taken to protect public health in- duced sharp declines in economic activity and a surge in job losses. Weaker demand and significantly lower oil prices were holding down consumer price inflation. Fi- nancial conditions had improved, in part reflecting pol- icy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses. Participants agreed that lowering the federal funds rate to its ELB had established more accommodative finan- cial conditions and that the Federal Reserve’s ongoing purchases of sizable quantities of Treasury securities and agency MBS had helped restore smooth market func- tioning to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses. The fiscal response to economic developments had been large and timely and was providing much needed support for economic activity. Credit flows and economic activity were also being supported by the lending facilities established un- der the authority of section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury. Participants judged that the effects of the coronavirus outbreak and the ongoing public health crisis will weigh heavily on economic activity, employment, and inflation in the near term and would pose considerable risks to the economic outlook over the medium term. Partici- pants agreed that the data for the second quarter would likely show the largest decline in economic activity in post–World War II history. Based in part on infor- mation from their Districts, participants observed that the burdens of the present crisis were not falling equally on all Americans and noted that the rise in joblessness was especially severe for lower-wage workers, women, African Americans, and Hispanics. Participants agreed that recently enacted fiscal policy programs had been de- livering valuable direct financial aid to households, busi- nesses, and communities, as well as providing relief to disadvantaged groups. Regarding household spending, participants pointed to information from District contacts, to surveys of con- sumer behavior, and to high-frequency indicators—such as credit card transactions, automated teller machine vis- its, and cellphone data tracking—as suggesting that con- sumer expenditures may be stabilizing or rebounding modestly. Limited available sources of standard eco- nomic data, such as retail purchases and motor vehicle sales, also seemed in line with this impression. With sup- portive monetary policy and payments to households under the CARES Act (Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act), including enhanced unemploy- ment insurance payments, participants expected per- sonal consumption expenditures to grow strongly in the second half of the year, albeit from very low levels. However, the recovery in consumer spending was not expected to be particularly rapid beyond this year, with voluntary social distancing, precautionary saving, and lower levels of employment and income restraining the pace of expansion over the medium term. Participants noted that levels of uncertainty and risks perceived by businesses remained high and that these factors continued to contribute to restraints on capital expenditures, despite easing in financing conditions stemming in part from recent policy measures. Some business contacts pointed to halting improvements in consumer demand, a dearth in public infrastructure pro- jects due to strained state and local government budget conditions, or the decline in energy prices as factors likely to depress business spending. Some participants also noted reports of firms stating that they have had some challenges in rehiring employees, in part related to temporary enhanced unemployment insurance benefits. Participants generally agreed that practices and develop- ments in public health to address the pandemic would be critical for ensuring a strong and lasting reopening of businesses and reducing the likelihood of an outsized wave of closures, but monetary policy and, especially, Page 10 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ fiscal policy would play important roles. Nevertheless, participants concluded that voluntary social distancing and structural shifts stemming from the pandemic would likely mean that some proportion of businesses would close permanently. Noting ongoing changes in the com- position of production and the processes by which pro- duction takes place, participants suggested that some business adaptations were likely to endure long after the coronavirus subsides, resulting in notable dislocation and sectoral reallocation of firms and workers across in- dustries. Participants noted that conditions in the energy sector remained difficult amid still-low oil prices. Several par- ticipants anticipated continued low drilling activity, at least until excess inventories were reduced later this year, and expressed concern that a wave of bankruptcies in the energy sector could be forthcoming. In addition, the agricultural sector continued to be under stress due to low prices for some farm commodities, reduced ethanol production, and pandemic-related limitations on pro- duction for some food processing plants. With regard to the labor market, participants remarked on the surprisingly positive news from the labor market report for May but emphasized that nearly 20 million jobs had been lost, on net, since February. Participants noted that because of misclassification errors in the Cur- rent Population Survey, the official unemployment rate for May likely understated the extent of unemployment; others observed that government reliance on unemploy- ment insurance as a vehicle for income support under the CARES Act complicates the interpretation of the data. Participants also noted that unemployment insur- ance claims continued to run at a historically elevated level, but the proportion of laid-off workers who ex- pected to be recalled was unusually large. Taken to- gether, the data suggested that April could turn out to be the trough of the recession, but participants agreed that it was too early to draw any firm conclusions. Prospects for further substantial improvement in the la- bor market were seen as depending on a sustained reo- pening of the economy, which in turn depended in large part on the efficacy of health measures taken to limit the effects of the coronavirus. On this issue, participants judged there to be a great deal of uncertainty and ex- pressed concerns about the possibility that an early reo- pening would contribute to a significant increase of in- fections. Participants also regarded highly accommoda- tive monetary policy and sustained support from fiscal policy as likely to be needed to facilitate a durable recov- ery in labor market conditions. Overall, participants ex- pected that a full recovery in employment would take some time. With regard to inflation, participants reiterated their view that the negative effect from the pandemic on ag- gregate demand was likely to more than offset any up- ward pressure from supply constraints so that the overall effect of the outbreak on prices was seen as disinflation- ary. Consistent with that interpretation, participants ob- served the recent negative readings on the monthly CPI and noted that they anticipated that the 12-month PCE inflation measure would likely run well below the Com- mittee’s 2 percent objective for some time. Observing that inflation had been running somewhat below the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run objective before the coronavirus outbreak, some participants noted a risk that long-term inflation expectations might deteriorate. Participants noted that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy would likely be needed for some time to achieve the 2 percent inflation objective over the longer run. Participants commented that there remained an extraor- dinary amount of uncertainty and considerable risks to the economic outlook. Participants shared views on possible outcomes for the reopening of the economy, the prospects for effective voluntary social distancing, and the efficacy of public health initiatives for their im- plications for economic activity and employment. A number of participants judged that there was a substan- tial likelihood of additional waves of outbreaks, which, in some scenarios, could result in further economic dis- ruptions and possibly a protracted period of reduced economic activity. Other possibilities included eco- nomic activity that might recover more quickly if sizable, widespread outbreaks could be avoided even as house- holds and businesses relax or modify social-distancing behaviors. Among the other sources of risk noted by participants were that fiscal support for households, businesses, and state and local governments might prove to be insufficient and that foreign economies could come under greater pressure than anticipated as a result of the spread of the pandemic abroad. Participants stressed that measures taken in the areas of health-care policy and fiscal policy, together with actions by house- holds and businesses, would shape the prospects for a prompt and timely return of the U.S. economy to more normal conditions. In addition, participants agreed that recent actions taken by the Federal Reserve had helped reduce risks to the economic outlook. Minutes of the Meeting of June 9–10, 2020 Page 11 _____________________________________________________________________________________________ As part of their discussions of longer-run risks, partici- pants noted that in some adverse scenarios, more busi- ness closures would occur, and workers would experi- ence longer spells of unemployment that could lead to a loss of skills that could impair their employment pro- spects. In addition, to the extent that transmission- mitigation procedures adopted by firms reduced their productivity, or if the reallocation of industry output re- sulted in a lasting reduction in business investment, the longer-run level of potential output could be reduced. Regarding developments in financial markets, partici- pants agreed that ongoing actions by the Federal Re- serve, including those undertaken in collaboration with the Treasury, had helped ease strains in some financial markets and supported the flow of credit to households, businesses, and communities. Measures of market func- tioning in the markets for Treasury securities and agency MBS had improved substantially since March. Strains in short-term funding markets had receded as well, and the volume of borrowing at many of the Federal Reserve’s liquidity facilities had moved lower as borrowers re- turned to market sources of funding. Risk spreads across a range of fixed-income markets had narrowed as the intense flight to safety witnessed in financial markets in the spring ebbed further. In their consideration of monetary policy at this meeting, participants reaffirmed that the Federal Reserve was committed to using its full range of tools to support the U.S. economy in this challenging time, thereby promot- ing its maximum-employment and price-stability goals. In light of their assessment that the ongoing public health crisis would weigh heavily on economic activity, employment, and inflation in the near term and posed considerable risks to the economic outlook over the me- dium term, all participants judged that it would be ap- propriate to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent. Keeping the target range at the ELB would continue to provide support to the economy and promote the Committee’s maximum- employment and price-stability goals. Participants also judged that it would be appropriate to maintain the tar- get range for the federal funds rate at its present level until policymakers were confident that the economy had weathered recent events and was on track to achieve the Committee’s maximum-employment and price-stability goals. Participants also agreed that, to support the flow of credit to households and businesses, over coming months it would be appropriate for the Federal Reserve to increase its holdings of Treasury securities and agency MBS and agency CMBS at least at the current pace to sustain smooth market functioning, thereby fostering ef- fective transmission of monetary policy to broader fi- nancial conditions. In addition, the Desk would con- tinue to offer large-scale overnight and term repo oper- ations. Participants noted that it would be important to continue to monitor developments closely and that the Committee would be prepared to adjust its plans as ap- propriate. Participants also commented that the lending facilities established by the Federal Reserve under the authority of section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act were sup- porting financial market functioning and the flow of credit to households, businesses of all sizes, and state and local governments. Several participants commented further that it would be important for the Federal Re- serve to remain ready to adjust these emergency lending facilities as appropriate based on its monitoring of finan- cial market functioning and credit conditions. Participants agreed that the current stance of monetary policy remained appropriate, but many noted that the Committee could, at upcoming meetings, further clarify its intentions with respect to its future monetary policy decisions as the economic outlook becomes clearer. In particular, most participants commented that the Com- mittee should communicate a more explicit form of for- ward guidance for the path of the federal funds rate and provide more clarity regarding purchases of Treasury se- curities and agency MBS as more information about the trajectory of the economy becomes available. A number of participants judged that it was important for forward guidance and asset purchases to be structured in a way that provides the accommodation necessary to support rapid economic recovery and fosters a durable return of inflation and inflation expectations to levels consistent with the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent objective. Many participants remarked that the completion of the monetary policy framework review, together with the announcement of the conclusions arising from the re- view and the release of a revised Committee statement on its goals and policy strategy, would help clarify further how the Committee intends to conduct monetary policy going forward. Committee Policy Action In their discussion of monetary policy for this meeting, members agreed that the coronavirus outbreak was caus- ing tremendous human and economic hardship across the United States and around the world. The virus and the measures taken to protect public health had induced sharp declines in economic activity and a surge in job Page 12 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ losses. Consumer price inflation was being held down by weaker demand and significantly lower oil prices. Fi- nancial conditions had improved, in part reflecting pol- icy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households, businesses, and communities. Members agreed that the Federal Reserve was commit- ted to using its full range of tools to support the U.S. economy in this challenging time, thereby promoting its maximum-employment and price-stability goals. Members further concurred that the ongoing public health crisis would weigh heavily on economic activity, employment, and inflation in the near term and posed considerable downside risks to the economic outlook over the medium term. In light of these developments, members decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent. Members noted that they expected to maintain this target range until they were confident that the economy had weathered recent events and was on track to achieve the Committee’s maximum-employment and price-stability goals. Members agreed that they would continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the eco- nomic outlook, including information related to public health, as well as global developments and muted infla- tion pressures, and would use the Committee’s tools and act as appropriate to support the economy. In determin- ing the timing and size of future adjustments to the stance of monetary policy, members noted that they would assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to the Committee’s maximum-employment ob- jective and its symmetric 2 percent inflation objective. This assessment would take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market condi- tions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation ex- pectations, and readings on financial and international developments. To support the flow of credit to households and busi- nesses, members agreed that over coming months it would be appropriate for the Federal Reserve to increase its holdings of Treasury securities and agency MBS and agency CMBS at least at the current pace to sustain smooth market functioning, thereby fostering effective transmission of monetary policy to broader financial conditions. In addition, the Desk would continue to of- fer large-scale overnight and term repo operations. Members agreed that they would closely monitor devel- opments and be prepared to adjust their plans as appro- priate. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the fol- lowing domestic policy directive, for release at 2:00 p.m.: “Effective June 11, 2020, the Federal Open Market Committee directs the Desk to:  Undertake open market operations as nec- essary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of 0 to ¼ percent.  Increase the System Open Market Account holdings of Treasury securities, agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS), and agency commercial mortgage-backed secu- rities (CMBS) at least at the current pace to sustain smooth functioning of markets for these securities, thereby fostering effective transmission of monetary policy to broader financial conditions.  Conduct term and overnight repurchase agreement operations to support effective policy implementation and the smooth functioning of short-term U.S. dollar fund- ing markets.  Conduct overnight reverse repurchase agreement operations at an offering rate of 0.00 percent and with a per-counterparty limit of $30 billion per day; the per-counter- party limit can be temporarily increased at the discretion of the Chair.  Roll over at auction all principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of Treasury securities and reinvest all principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s hold- ings of agency debt and agency MBS in agency MBS and all principal payments from holdings of agency CMBS in agency CMBS.  Allow modest deviations from stated amounts for purchases and reinvestments, if needed for operational reasons.  Engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settle- ment of the Federal Reserve’s agency MBS transactions.” The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below for release at 2:00 p.m.: “The Federal Reserve is committed to using its full range of tools to support the U.S. economy in this challenging time, thereby promoting its maximum employment and price stability goals.

Clouse Secretary Page 14 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Summary of Economic Projections In conjunction with the Federal Open Market Commit- tee (FOMC) meeting held on June 9–10, 2020, meeting participants submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real gross domestic product (GDP) growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation for each year from 2020 to 2022 and over the longer run. Each participant’s projections were based on information available at the time of the meeting, together with his or her assessment of appropriate monetary policy—includ- ing a path for the federal funds rate and its longer-run value—and assumptions about other factors likely to af- fect economic outcomes. The longer-run projections represent each participant’s assessment of the value to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the ab- sence of further shocks to the economy.1 “Appropriate monetary policy” is defined as the future path of policy that each participant deems most likely to foster out- comes for economic activity and inflation that best sat- isfy his or her individual interpretation of the statutory mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability. The current projections for real activity, the labor mar- ket, and inflation were substantially weaker than the pro- jections in the December 2019 Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) because participants revised their eco- nomic outlook in light of the effects of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and the measures taken to con- tain it.2 Table 1 and figure 1 provide summary statistics for the projections; participants’ projections in the cur- rent SEP reflected their assumptions about the course of the pandemic and actions to control its spread. All par- ticipants projected that real GDP will contract sharply in 2020 and that the unemployment rate in the final quarter of the year would be markedly higher than they had pro- jected in December. Almost all participants projected that real GDP would grow faster than their estimates of its longer-run normal growth rate in 2021 and 2022 and that the unemployment rate would decline. Participants expected that a full economic recovery would take some time, with almost all participants projecting that the un- employment rate in the final quarter of 2022 would still be above their estimates of its level in the longer run. 1 One participant did not submit longer-run projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, or the federal funds rate. Similarly, almost all participants projected that total in- flation, as measured by the four-quarter percent change in the price index for personal consumption expendi- tures (PCE), would be below the FOMC’s 2 percent in- flation objective throughout the forecast period. Projec- tions for core PCE inflation, which excludes food and energy, generally followed a trajectory similar to the pro- jections for total inflation. As shown in figure 2, almost all participants indicated that their expectations regarding the evolution of the economy, relative to the Committee’s objectives of max- imum employment and 2 percent inflation, would likely warrant keeping the federal funds rate at its current level through at least the end of 2022. The median of partic- ipants’ assessments of the longer-run level for the federal funds rate was unchanged from its value in the Decem- ber SEP. Amid uncertainty about the course of the pandemic and its effects on the economy, all participants regarded the uncertainties around their projections as higher than the average over the past 20 years. In addition, a substantial majority of participants assessed the risks to their out- look for real GDP growth as weighted to the downside and the risks to their unemployment rate projections as weighted to the upside. The risks to inflation projections were judged as weighted to the downside by a substantial majority of participants; no participant assessed the risks to his or her inflation outlook as weighted to the upside. The Outlook for Real GDP Growth and the Unem- ployment Rate As illustrated in figure 3.A, which shows the distribu- tions of participants’ projections for real GDP growth from 2020 to 2022 and in the longer run, all participants projected that real GDP will decline in 2020, a develop- ment that reflects the coronavirus outbreak and the measures undertaken to contain its spread. The projec- tions ranged from a decline of 10.0 percent to a decline of 4.2 percent, with the median projection being a de- crease of 6.5 percent. These projections were substan- tially weaker than those from the December SEP when real GDP was expected to expand this year at close to participants’ estimates of its longer-run rate. Current ex- 2 The preceding SEP occurred in December 2019. Because of the extraordinary circumstances surrounding the March 2020 FOMC meeting, participants did not submit quarterly eco- nomic projections at that meeting.

PCE inﬂation and core PCE inﬂation are the percentage rates of change in, respectively, the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE) and the price index for PCE excluding food and energy. Projections for the unemployment rate are for the average civilian unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of the year indicated. Each participant’s projections are based on his or her assessment of appropriate monetary policy. Longer-run projections represent each participant’s assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy. The projections for the federal funds rate are the value of the midpoint of the projected appropriate target range for the federal funds rate or the projected appropriate target level for the federal funds rate at the end of the speciﬁed calendar year or over the longer run. The December projections were made in conjunction with the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee on December 10–11, 2019. One participant did not submit longer-run projections for the change in real GDP, the unemployment rate, or the federal funds rate in conjunction with the December 10–11, 2019, meeting, and one participant did not submit such projections in conjunction with the June 9–10, 2020, meeting. No projections were submitted in conjunction with the March 2020 FOMC meeting. 1. For each period, the median is the middle projection when the projections are arranged from lowest to highest. When the number of projections is even, the median is the average of the two middle projections. 2. The central tendency excludes the three highest and three lowest projections for each variable in each year. 3. The range for a variable in a given year includes all participants’ projections, from lowest to highest, for that variable in that year. 4. Longer-run projections for core PCE inﬂation are not collected.

Summary of Economic Projections of the Meeting of June 9–10, 2020 Page 5 _____________________________________________________________________________________________ ___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ pectations were generally for economic activity to re- cover during the next couple of years. Almost all partic- ipants expected that the rate of real GDP growth in 2021 and 2022 would be above their estimates of its longer- run pace, with the median projections being 5.0 percent and 3.5 percent, respectively. The distribution of esti- mates of real GDP growth in the longer run was little changed from the December SEP, although the median projection ticked down to 1.8 percent. The distributions of participants’ projections for the un- employment rate from 2020 to 2022 and in the longer run are shown in figure 3.B. Reflecting the effects of the pandemic, the projections for the unemployment rate were revised up considerably throughout the forecast period relative to the December SEP. The projections for the unemployment rate in the final quarter of this year ranged from 7.0 to 14.0 percent, with a median of 9.3 percent. For the final quarter of 2021, the projec- tions for the unemployment rate ranged from 4.5 to 12.0 percent, with the median being 6.5 percent. The width of the ranges of the forecasts for the unemploy- ment rate in the final quarters of this year and next year were 7.0 percentage points and 7.5 percentage points, re- spectively—more than three times the widest ranges for forecasts of similar horizons that were submitted from 2007 to 2009. This unusually wide range of projections highlighted the challenges of assessing the economic damage caused by the pandemic and of forecasting the recovery in the labor market. The median projection for the unemployment rate in the final quarter of 2022, at 5.5 percent, was above the median estimate of the longer-run normal rate of unemployment of 4.1 percent. Indeed, almost all participants who submitted longer- run projections expected that the unemployment rate in the final quarter of 2022 would still be above their esti- mates of the longer-run value. Participants pointed to a number of factors to explain the persistence of labor market slack, including the continuation of voluntary so- cial distancing, unusual disruptions to labor markets, and the need for businesses to restructure supply chains and other aspects of their operations. The distribution of estimates for the longer-run unemployment rate was lit- tle changed from the December SEP. The Outlook for Inflation Figures 3.C and 3.D show the distributions of partici- pants’ projections for total and core PCE inflation from 2020 to 2022 and in the longer run. All participants re- vised down their projections for inflation in 2020 relative to their December projections. Participants expected that, in 2020, total inflation would be between 0.5 and 1.2 percent, while core inflation would be between Table 2.

As described in the box “Forecast Uncertainty,” under certain assumptions, there is about a 70 percent probability that actual outcomes for real GDP, unemployment, consumer prices, and the federal funds rate will be in ranges implied by the average size of projection errors made in the past. For more information, see David Reifschneider and Peter Tulip (2017), “Gauging the Uncertainty of the Economic Outlook Using His- torical Forecasting Errors: The Federal Reserve’s Approach,” Finance and Economics Discussion Series 2017-020 (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, February), https://dx. doi.org/10.17016/FEDS.2017.020. 1. Definitions of variables are in the general note to table 1. 2. Measure is the overall consumer price index, the price measure that has been most widely used in government and private economic forecasts. Projections are percent changes on a fourth quarter to fourth quarter basis. 3. For Federal Reserve staff forecasts, measure is the federal funds rate. For other forecasts, measure is the rate on 3-month Treasury bills. Projection errors are calculated using average levels, in percent, in the fourth quarter. 0.7 and 1.3 percent, with median expectations for total and core inflation of 0.8 percent and 1.0 percent, respec- tively. In the December SEP, participants had expected that total inflation would be between 1.7 and 2.3 percent in 2020. In the current SEP, almost all participants ex- pected the inflation rate to rise over the next two years. However, the vast majority of participants expected PCE price inflation in 2022 to fall short of the Commit- tee’s 2 percent inflation objective, with the median pro- jection for total PCE price inflation being 1.7 percent. Appropriate Monetary Policy The distributions of participants’ judgments regarding the appropriate target—or midpoint of the target range—for the federal funds rate at the end of each year from 2020 to 2022 and over the longer run are shown in figure 3.E. With substantial agreement that the unem- ployment rate would remain above its longer-run level throughout the forecast period and that inflation would run below the Committee’s objective of 2 percent, al- most all participants projected that it would be appropri- ate to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent through at least the end of 2022. The median of participants’ estimates of the longer-run level of the federal funds rate was unchanged from December at 2.50 percent, although a few participants revised down their estimates.

Page 10 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Uncertainty and Risk In assessing the appropriate path for monetary policy, FOMC participants take account of the range of possible economic outcomes, the likelihood of those outcomes, and the potential benefits and costs should they occur. Participants’ assessments of the level of uncertainty sur- rounding their individual economic projections relative to the average level of uncertainty over the past 20 years are shown in the panels on the left side of figure 4.3 All participants viewed the current uncertainty surrounding each of the four economic variables—real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, total PCE inflation, and core PCE inflation—as being greater than the average over the past 20 years, which is the first time this situation has occurred since the introduction of the SEP in 2007.4 Participants’ assessments of the balance of risks to their current economic projections are shown in the panels on the right side of figure 4. A substantial majority of par- ticipants judged the risks to their projections for real GDP growth as weighted to the downside and the risks to their unemployment rate projections as weighted to the upside. A substantial majority of participants viewed the risks to their inflation projections as weighted to the downside; no participant assessed the risks to his or her inflation outlook as weighted to the upside. In discussing the uncertainty and risks surrounding their economic projections, the course of the pandemic was generally mentioned as a key source of uncertainty. The possibilities of second waves of contagion and delays in 3 As a reference, table 2 provides estimates of the forecast un- certainty for the change in real GDP, the unemployment rate, and total consumer price inflation over the period from 2000 through 2019. At the end of this summary, the box “Forecast Uncertainty” discusses the sources and interpretation of un- certainty in the economic forecasts and explains the approach used to assess the uncertainty and risks attending participants’ projections. developing a vaccine were seen as potential downside risks to the economic outlook, and faster-than- anticipated progress in responding to or treating the coronavirus were seen as potential upside risks. Partici- pants also mentioned a number of other unknowns and risk factors related to the outlook, including the extent of supply-side disruptions; possible changes in house- hold behavior; the degree to which business bankrupt- cies might cause dislocations; the extent of fiscal policy support; and possibly depressed foreign demand given the global nature of the pandemic. Several participants also expressed concerns about longer-run issues in the event of a prolonged recession, such as labor market scarring if the unemployment rate remained elevated and inflation persistently undershooting the FOMC’s 2 per- cent inflation objective. Participants’ assessments of the appropriate future path of the federal funds rate are also subject to considerable uncertainty. Because the Committee adjusts monetary policy in response to actual and prospective develop- ments over time in key economic variables—such as real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation— uncertainty surrounding the projected path for the fed- eral funds rate importantly reflects the uncertainties about the paths for these economic variables, along with other factors. As with the macroeconomic variables, the forecast uncertainty surrounding the appropriate path of the federal funds rate is substantial. 4 Previous SEP addendums to the FOMC minutes contained figures showing the median projections, along with confi- dence intervals based on historical forecast errors. Because the level of uncertainty about the economic outlook is cur- rently judged to be higher than its historical average as a result of uncertainty about the course of the coronavirus and its ef- fects on the economy, these “fan charts” have been omitted from this addendum.

Considera- ble uncertainty attends these projections, however. The economic and statistical models and relationships used to help produce economic forecasts are necessarily im- perfect descriptions of the real world, and the future path of the economy can be affected by myriad unfore- seen developments and events. Thus, in setting the stance of monetary policy, participants consider not only what appears to be the most likely economic out- come as embodied in their projections, but also the range of alternative possibilities, the likelihood of their occurring, and the potential costs to the economy should they occur. Table 2 summarizes the average historical accuracy of a range of forecasts, including those reported in past Monetary Policy Reports and those prepared by the Federal Reserve Board’s staff in advance of meetings of the Fed- eral Open Market Committee (FOMC). The projection error ranges shown in the table illustrate the considera- ble uncertainty associated with economic forecasts. For example, suppose a participant projects that real gross domestic product (GDP) and total consumer prices will rise steadily at annual rates of, respectively, 3 percent and 2 percent. If the uncertainty attending those pro- jections is similar to that experienced in the past and the risks around the projections are broadly balanced, the numbers reported in table 2 would imply a probability of about 70 percent that actual GDP would expand within a range of 1.7 to 4.3 percent in the current year, 1.2 to 4.8 percent in the second year, and 1.0 to 5.0 per- cent in the third year. The corresponding 70 percent confidence intervals for overall inflation would be 1.3 to 2.7 percent in the current year and 1.0 to 3.0 percent in the second and third years. Because current conditions may differ from those that prevailed, on average, over history, participants provide judgments as to whether the uncertainty attached to their projections of each economic variable is greater than, smaller than, or broadly similar to typical levels of forecast uncertainty seen in the past 20 years, as presented in ta- ble 2. That is, participants judge whether each economic variable is more likely to be above or below their projec- tions of the most likely outcome. These judgments about the uncertainty and the risks attending each participant’s projections are distinct from the diversity of participants’ views about the most likely outcomes. Forecast uncer- tainty is concerned with the risks associated with a partic- ular projection rather than with divergences across a num- ber of different projections. As with real activity and in- flation, the outlook for the future path of the federal funds rate is subject to considerable uncertainty. This uncer- tainty arises primarily because each participant’s assess- ment of the appropriate stance of monetary policy de- pends importantly on the evolution of real activity and in- flation over time. If economic conditions evolve in an un- expected manner, then assessments of the appropriate set- ting of the federal funds rate would change from that point forward. The final line in table 2 shows the error ranges for forecasts of short-term interest rates. They suggest that the historical confidence intervals associated with pro- jections of the federal funds rate are quite wide. It should be noted, however, that these confidence intervals are not strictly consistent with the projections for the federal funds rate, as these projections are not forecasts of the most likely quarterly outcomes but rather are projections of par- ticipants’ individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy and are on an end-of-year basis. However, the fore- cast errors should provide a sense of the uncertainty around the future path of the federal funds rate generated by the uncertainty about the macroeconomic variables as well as additional adjustments to monetary policy that would be appropriate to offset the effects of shocks to the economy.

At this meeting, they discussed potential changes to the Com- mittee’s Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy. Participants agreed that, in light of fun- damental changes in the economy over the past dec- ade—including generally lower levels of interest rates and persistent disinflationary pressures in the United States and abroad—and given what has been learned during the monetary policy framework review, refining the statement could be helpful in increasing the trans- parency and accountability of monetary policy. Such re- finements could also facilitate well-informed deci- sionmaking by households and businesses, and, as a re- sult, better position the Committee to meet its maxi- mum-employment and price-stability objectives. Partic- ipants noted that the Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy serves as the foundation for the Committee’s policy actions and that it would be important to finalize all changes to the statement in the near future. Developments in Financial Markets and Open Mar- ket Operations The System Open Market Account (SOMA) manager turned first to a review of U.S. financial market develop- ments. Over the intermeeting period, overall financial conditions eased slightly. Broad equity price indexes 6 Attended the discussion of developments in financial mar- kets and open market operations. 7 Attended Tuesday’s session only. Page 2 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ were roughly flat even as concerns about the resurgence in the coronavirus (COVID-19) in the United States grew. At the same time, Treasury yields and other sov- ereign yields declined, and the U.S. dollar weakened. Overall, volatility remained subdued relative to recent periods. While the S&P 500 index was little changed, the effect of renewed outbreaks was evident in the differentiated performance across S&P industry sectors. Virus-sensi- tive sectors and firms with weaker fundamentals under- performed over the period, as they had over the broader pandemic episode. Airline and hotel share prices de- clined sharply, and share prices of banks—which faced earnings pressures from large loan loss provisions and compressed net interest margins—continued to under- perform. As the SOMA manager highlighted, the S&P 500 index has been supported by its significant share of technology firms, many of which have been relatively re- silient to virus containment measures. In contrast, smaller firms not well represented in the S&P 500 may be experiencing greater effects on their businesses due to the virus—a possibility consistent with the underper- formance of the broader Russell 2000 index over the in- termeeting period. The market-implied path of the federal funds rate shifted down modestly over the intermeeting period. The cor- responding path implied by responses to the Open Mar- ket Desk’s Survey of Primary Dealers and Survey of Market Participants also fell, as the probabilities placed on rate hikes next year and in 2022 declined. Market pricing suggested that the federal funds rate was ex- pected to first rise above the current target range in 2024. That timing was broadly consistent with survey respond- ents’ expectations regarding the timing of the first in- crease in the target range, although the range of survey responses was wide. The SOMA manager noted that survey responses suggested that the dispersion in views about the timing of a rate increase might be related to differing views about the economic conditions that would prevail when the FOMC first lifted the target range, as survey respondents’ views about those condi- tions were also dispersed. The SOMA manager reported that market functioning across a number of market segments remained stable at significantly improved levels. In Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) markets, many mar- 8 The approved FIMA Desk Resolution, which updates the March 2020 resolution with a new expiration date, is available with other Committee organizational documents at ket functioning indicators had returned to levels prevail- ing before the pandemic, and, as a result, purchases were conducted at the minimum pace directed by the Com- mittee. Importantly, with conditions in MBS markets continuing to stabilize, primary mortgage rates fell to historically low levels over the intermeeting period. Conditions in short-term dollar funding markets were also stable, with overnight rates close to the interest on excess reserves (IOER) rate. In broader dollar funding markets, term unsecured rates and foreign exchange swap spreads were also steady. Federal Reserve repur- chase agreements (repos) outstanding fell from $185 bil- lion to zero over the intermeeting period. With the tim- ing of the overnight operations now having shifted to the afternoon when most trading activity in the repo market is complete and with minimum bid rates above the IOER rate, repo operations had been effectively po- sitioned in a backstop role for the time being. As term U.S. dollar liquidity swaps matured, the amounts out- standing fell to around $120 billion, less than a third of the peak reached in late May. In light of improved conditions across these markets, the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet declined over the in- termeeting period from $7.2 trillion to $7.0 trillion. The decline was driven by the reductions in repo and U.S. dollar liquidity swaps outstanding. These reductions more than offset ongoing purchases of Treasury securi- ties and agency MBS. The manager discussed a proposal to extend the tempo- rary U.S. dollar liquidity swap arrangements as well as the temporary FIMA (Foreign and International Mone- tary Authorities) Repo Facility through March of next year. Keeping these arrangements in place would help sustain recent improvements in global dollar funding markets and support smooth functioning of the U.S. Treasury market. Under the proposal, provided that the Committee had no objections, the Chair would approve the extension of the temporary liquidity swap lines fol- lowing the meeting. The extensions of the swap and FIMA repo arrangements would be announced follow- ing this meeting. By unanimous vote, the Committee voted to approve a resolution that extended through March 31, 2021, the expiration of a temporary repo facility for foreign and international monetary authorities (FIMA Repo Facil- ity).8 https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/rules_au- thorizations.htm. _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Minutes of the Meeting of July 28–29, 2020 Page 3 Secretary’s note: The Chair subsequently pro- vided approval to the Desk, following the pro- cedures in the Authorization for Foreign Cur- rency Operations, to extend the expiration of the temporary U.S. dollar liquidity swap lines through March 31, 2021. By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk’s domestic transactions over the intermeeting period. There were no intervention operations in foreign curren- cies for the System’s account during the intermeeting pe- riod. Staff Review of the Economic Situation The coronavirus outbreak and the measures undertaken to contain its spread continued to have substantial ef- fects on economic activity in the United States and abroad. The information available at the time of the July 28–29 meeting suggested that U.S. economic activ- ity had picked up in May and June following sharp de- clines in March and April. Measured on a quarterly basis, however, it appeared that real gross domestic product (GDP) had decreased at a historically rapid rate in the second quarter. Labor market conditions improved con- siderably in June, but the improvements over May and June were modest relative to the substantial deteriora- tion seen in March and April. Consumer price infla- tion—as measured by the 12-month percentage change in the price index for personal consumption expendi- tures (PCE) through May—remained well below the rates that prevailed early in the year. Total nonfarm payroll employment expanded robustly in June, as it did in May, but the gains in those two months offset only about one-third of the jobs lost in March and April. The unemployment rate moved down further to 11.1 percent, but it continued to be far above its level at the beginning of the year. The unemployment rates for African Americans, Asians, and Hispanics de- clined, on balance, over the past two months but re- mained well above the national average. Both the labor force participation rate and the employment-to-popula- tion ratio increased further in June. Initial claims for un- employment insurance benefits continued to decrease, on net, through the middle of July, but the pace of de- clines had slowed in recent weeks. In addition, weekly estimates of private-sector payrolls constructed by the Board’s staff using data provided by the payroll proces- sor ADP, along with some other high-frequency measures—such as employment at small businesses and job postings—suggested that employment gains had slowed since mid-June but likely were still strong. Total PCE price inflation was 0.5 percent over the 12 months ending in May, reflecting both weak aggre- gate demand and a considerable drop in consumer en- ergy prices. Core PCE price inflation, which excludes changes in consumer food and energy prices, was 1.0 percent over the same 12-month period. In contrast, the trimmed mean measure of 12-month PCE price in- flation constructed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dal- las was 2.0 percent in May. The consumer price index (CPI) increased 0.6 percent over the 12 months ending in June, while core CPI inflation was 1.2 percent over the same period. On a monthly basis, the available data indicated that consumer prices—as measured by the PCE price index in May and the CPI in June—had turned up after having fallen in March and April; this re- bound was evident in many price categories that were most affected by social-distancing measures. Recent readings on survey-based measures of longer-run infla- tion expectations were little changed on balance. The University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers measure for the next 5 to 10 years was unchanged, on net, from May to early July; the three-year-ahead measure from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s Survey of Con- sumer Expectations edged down in June but remained within its recent range. Real PCE rebounded robustly in May, with particularly strong growth in spending for consumer goods but more moderate gains in expenditures for consumer services. In June, the components of retail sales used by the Bu- reau of Economic Analysis to estimate PCE, along with light motor vehicle sales, increased further. Overall, however, real consumer spending remained well below the levels that prevailed at the beginning of the year. Moreover, recent high-frequency indicators of spending on many consumer services—such as restaurant dining, hotel accommodations, and air travel—remained very subdued. Real disposable personal income fell back in May, primarily reflecting the waning of the substantial boost that federal stimulus payments had provided in April. However, wage and salary income increased strongly in May, though to a level still below its February value, and unemployment insurance benefits continued to be substantial, leaving the personal saving rate quite elevated. The consumer sentiment measures from both the Michigan survey and the Conference Board survey improved notably in June but fell back somewhat in July. Housing-sector activity bounced back strongly in recent months, likely boosted in part by the effects of low in- terest rates. Starts and building permit issuance for sin- gle-family homes, along with starts of multifamily units, increased significantly over May and June; however, Page 4 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ these construction measures were still below their pre- pandemic levels. Sales of existing homes rose substan- tially over those two months, and new home sales also moved up on net. Indicators of business fixed investment suggested that investment had generally not begun to recover but that the pace of declines had moderated, on balance, in re- cent months. Nominal new orders and shipments of nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft increased in May and June, but they remained below their levels at the beginning of the year, while some measures of busi- ness sentiment improved. Nominal business spending on nonresidential structures outside of the drilling and mining sector declined further in May, and the number of crude oil and natural gas rigs in operation—an indica- tor of business spending on structures in the drilling and mining sector—continued to decrease through late July. Industrial production expanded briskly in May and June, as many factories reopened or ramped up production. The surge in manufacturing production was led by ap- preciable gains in the output of motor vehicles and re- lated parts following extended automaker shutdowns from mid-March through April. In contrast, output in the mining sector—which includes crude oil extrac- tion—decreased further, reflecting the effects of still- low crude oil prices. Total real government purchases appeared to have in- creased moderately, on balance, in the second quarter. Federal defense spending continued to rise through June, and nondefense purchases were likely boosted in the second quarter by fiscal policy measures taken in re- sponse to the coronavirus. In contrast, state and local purchases looked to have declined markedly, as the pay- rolls of these governments shrank further in June, and nominal state and local construction expenditures de- creased, on net, over April and May. The nominal U.S. international trade deficit widened in May relative to April, as exports decreased more than imports. The fall in exports was broad based across goods categories, while lower imports of automotive products more than offset higher imports of consumer goods and industrial supplies. Following April’s historic plunge, exports and imports of services fell a bit further in May, driven by the continued suspension of most in- ternational travel. Preliminary data for June showed some recovery in nominal goods exports and imports. Altogether, the available data suggested that net exports were a significant drag on the rate of change in real GDP in the second quarter. Incoming data suggested that foreign economic activity plunged in the second quarter as a result of the corona- virus pandemic and the measures undertaken to contain it. There were also signs that many foreign economies started to recover over the past few months as re- strictions were gradually eased. In China, where eco- nomic activity had collapsed in the first quarter and re- strictions were rolled back earlier than elsewhere, the preliminary GDP release showed that the economy bounced back strongly in the second quarter. In the euro area and other advanced foreign economies, recent data on industrial production and, to a lesser extent, con- sumer spending showed a partial recovery in May and June. However, continued uncertainty about the course of the virus was underscored by the fact that some emerging market economies were struggling to control the pandemic, while some other countries that previ- ously contained the virus were experiencing flare-ups of new infections. Inflation rates continued to fall in most foreign economies through June because of low energy prices and weak demand, and measures of inflation ex- pectations remained subdued. Staff Review of the Financial Situation Amid sizable fluctuations, changes in asset prices over the intermeeting period were mixed on net. Financial market sentiment was boosted by better-than-expected economic data for the United States, China, and Europe. However, the boost to sentiment appeared to have been offset by concerns about the domestic spread of the coronavirus and its uncertain effects on the future course of the economy. On balance, broad equity price indexes were roughly unchanged, Treasury yields de- clined and the yield curve flattened, corporate and mu- nicipal bond spreads narrowed, and the dollar weakened somewhat. Liquidity conditions continued to normalize but had not returned to their pre-pandemic levels in sev- eral markets. Over the intermeeting period, yields on nominal Treas- ury securities fell and the yield curve flattened on net. Yields declined somewhat at the start of the intermeeting period following the more-accommodative-than-ex- pected June FOMC communications. The further de- cline in yields that occurred over subsequent weeks likely reflected concerns about the surge in confirmed corona- virus cases across many parts of the United States. Measures of inflation compensation based on Treasury Inflation Protected Securities maturing over the next few years continued to rebound from their sharp drop in mid-March. The rebound was reportedly driven primar- ily by investors’ interpretation of recent economic data, which suggested that the risk of deflation had abated _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Minutes of the Meeting of July 28–29, 2020 Page 5 somewhat, as well as by some improvement in market liquidity. Despite the uptick, both the 5-year and 10-year measures of inflation compensation remained below their pre-pandemic levels. The expected path of the fed- eral funds rate based on a straight read of overnight in- dex swap quotes declined modestly and stayed close to the effective lower bound at least through the first half of 2024. Market-implied forward rates referring to 2021 and 2022 remained slightly negative; however, market commentary suggested that investors generally did not expect the FOMC to lower the federal funds target range below zero. Broad stock price indexes fluctuated substantially, largely in reaction to news about the pandemic and eco- nomic activity, and ended the intermeeting period roughly unchanged. Technology stocks continued to outperform the broader market, whereas equity prices in the bank and energy sectors fell notably over the period. One-month option-implied volatility on the S&P 500 in- dex—the VIX—rose markedly earlier in the period but subsequently declined and ended the period lower. Eq- uity market volatility remained elevated relative to its normal range over the past several years. Spreads of in- vestment- and speculative-grade corporate bond yields over comparable-maturity Treasury yields narrowed somewhat and had retraced most of their pandemic-re- lated surge. Conditions in short-term funding markets were generally stable over the intermeeting period. Spreads for nego- tiable certificates of deposit and most types of commer- cial paper were little changed, on net, and spreads and issuance volumes for both types of instruments reached pre-pandemic levels. In light of the stable market con- ditions, there was little activity in the emergency liquidity facilities. Since the June FOMC meeting, assets under management for prime money market funds (MMFs) were little changed, whereas government MMFs experi- enced moderate outflows. Amid heavy issuance of se- curities by the Treasury, government MMFs continued to increase their holdings of Treasury securities while re- ducing their holdings of repos. The effective federal funds rate (EFFR) and Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) increased, on aver- age, 4 basis points and 5 basis points, respectively, from the previous intermeeting period. The EFFR fluctuated between 8 and 10 basis points, and the SOFR fluctuated between 7 and 13 basis points, throughout the inter- meeting period. The decline in total outstanding Federal Reserve repo operations from $185 billion to zero largely reflected an increase in minimum bid rates at the Federal Reserve’s overnight and term repo operations. Over the intermeeting period, the Federal Reserve main- tained the purchases of Treasury securities and agency MBS at the pace prevailing at the end of the previous intermeeting period. Risk sentiment abroad fluctuated over the intermeeting period as market participants weighed increasing coro- navirus cases in a number of countries against improving economic data releases and ongoing fiscal and monetary policy support. Foreign equity prices generally declined on net. A resurgence of geopolitical tensions between the United States and China weighed on investor senti- ment late in the period and prompted a partial retrace- ment of earlier gains for the Shanghai Composite Index. Long-term sovereign yields in most advanced foreign economies (AFEs) ended the period moderately lower. The yield spreads of long-term Italian bonds over their German counterparts narrowed further, reaching the lowest level since March following agreement on the Eu- ropean Union (EU) Recovery Fund. The staff’s broad dollar index declined slightly, on net, with moderate depreciation against AFE currencies. The EU Recovery Fund agreement supported the euro, which appreciated about 3 percent against the dollar over the intermeeting period. In contrast, the Brazilian real depreciated about 5 percent against the dollar, amid continued policy rate cuts by the Central Bank of Brazil, escalating coronavirus cases, and political turmoil in Bra- zil. Capital market financing conditions for nonfinancial firms eased somewhat further over the intermeeting pe- riod, with yields on corporate bonds remaining near his- torical lows. Investment-grade corporate bond issuance was solid in June, and speculative-grade issuance re- mained robust. Gross institutional leveraged loan issu- ance picked up in June from its subdued levels in previ- ous months. Gross equity issuance hit a record level in June, as the volume of seasoned equity offerings reached a new record, while initial public offerings rebounded from their very low levels of the previous three months. In the July Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices (SLOOS), banks reported a notable tightening of lending standards on commercial and in- dustrial (C&I) loans to firms of all sizes in the second quarter. Standards were reported to be at the tighter end of their range since 2005, a marked change from a year ago. C&I loans on banks’ balance sheets contracted sig- nificantly in June, reflecting paydowns of the record draws on credit lines seen in previous months, as well as low originations. Page 6 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Credit quality of nonfinancial corporations deteriorated further over the intermeeting period, with a sizable vol- ume of speculative-grade debt downgraded in June. De- faults in May reached their highest single-month volume since 2009, and June defaults were high as well. Market indicators of future default expectations also deterio- rated somewhat. Municipal market financing conditions remained accommodative, although the credit quality of municipal debt continued to show signs of weakness. Financing conditions for small businesses remained tight. Banks reported in the July SLOOS that the level of standards for small businesses was at the tighter end of the range since 2005. At the same time, the credit needs of small businesses remained high, as the prospect arose of many businesses having to shut down opera- tions again in response to rising coronavirus cases. Small business loan performance deteriorated significantly; short-term delinquencies were comparable with levels seen in early 2008. Amid tighter lending standards and high credit demand, advances via the Paycheck Protec- tion Program Lending Facility continued to grow over the intermeeting period. In early July, the Main Street Lending Program became fully operational. Financing conditions for commercial real estate (CRE), particularly those in capital markets, recovered further over the intermeeting period. Spreads on non-agency commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) contin- ued to decline in June, while issuance of non-agency CMBS continued to show signs of moderate recovery in May and June. Spreads on agency CMBS remained at pre-pandemic levels, and agency CMBS issuance was strong. In contrast, bank lending standards for CRE loans tightened further, according to the July SLOOS, and CRE loan growth at banks slowed. The credit qual- ity of existing CRE loans continued to deteriorate as fur- ther signs of repayment difficulties emerged, most nota- bly in the lodging and retail sectors. Financing conditions in the residential mortgage market were generally unchanged over the intermeeting period. The spread between the primary mortgage rate and MBS yields remained wide, reflecting capacity constraints at loan originators, increased origination costs, and de- creases in the value of servicing rights. Credit continued to flow to borrowers with higher credit scores seeking mortgages that met standard conforming loan criteria, and low mortgage interest rates supported elevated refi- nancing activity. Financing conditions remained tight, however, for borrowers with relatively low credit scores and for those seeking nonconforming mortgages. The July SLOOS and other surveys of mortgage market con- ditions suggested that both bank and nonbank lenders tightened standards in the second quarter. The credit quality of mortgages did not appear to deteriorate fur- ther over the period. Financing conditions for consumer credit tightened a bit further during the intermeeting period. In the credit card market, lending standards at commercial banks tightened further according to the July SLOOS. In con- trast, conditions in the auto loan market appeared to be little changed, on balance, with those for subprime bor- rowers remaining tight. Conditions in the consumer as- set-backed securities (ABS) markets were stable during the intermeeting period. Yield spreads for certain highly rated credit card and auto loan ABS stabilized at pre- pandemic levels, while student and auto loan ABS issu- ance recovered to a pre-pandemic pace. Consumer credit quality remained stable, partly due to forbearance programs. The staff provided an update on its assessment of the stability of the financial system, and, on balance, charac- terized the financial vulnerabilities of the U.S. financial system as notable, while noting an unusually high level of uncertainty associated with this assessment. The staff judged that asset valuation pressures were notable. In particular, high-yield and investment-grade corporate bond spreads were within historical norms, and com- mercial real estate prices were continuing to increase de- spite rising vacancy rates. The staff assessed vulnerabil- ities due to nonfinancial leverage to have risen from moderate to notable, reflecting declines in household in- comes and business profits; such declines implied less resilient borrowers. The expected sharp decline in sec- ond-quarter real GDP would likely result in a rise in the ratio of household debt to nominal GDP. The ratio of business debt to nominal GDP rose in the first quarter from levels that were already historically high—amid de- clining profits and deteriorating credit quality—although low interest rates had helped ease firms’ debt servicing burdens. The staff assessed vulnerabilities arising from financial leverage to have increased from low to moder- ate, citing uncertainty about losses connected to business loans for banks and a higher weight on vulnerabilities connected to leverage at nonbank financial institutions. Vulnerabilities associated with maturity and liquidity transformation were characterized as moderate, and the staff noted that Federal Reserve facilities reduced these vulnerabilities at nonbanks. _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Minutes of the Meeting of July 28–29, 2020 Page 7 Staff Economic Outlook In the U.S. economic projection prepared by the staff for the July FOMC meeting, the estimated level of real GDP in the second quarter was marked up compared with the June meeting forecast, reflecting the better- than-expected data through June. Nevertheless, eco- nomic activity still appeared to have declined at a histor- ically rapid rate in the second quarter. The projected rate of recovery in real GDP, and the pace of declines in the unemployment rate, over the second half of this year were expected to be somewhat less robust than in the previous forecast. Although the staff assumed that ad- ditional fiscal stimulus measures would be enacted be- yond those anticipated in the June forecast, the positive effect on the economic outlook was outweighed some- what by the staff’s assessment of the likely effects of sev- eral other factors. Those factors included the increasing spread of the coronavirus in the United States since mid- June; the reactions of many states and localities in slow- ing or scaling back the reopening of their economies, es- pecially for businesses, such as restaurants and bars, providing services that entail personal interactions; and some high-frequency indicators that pointed to a decel- eration in economic activity. Substantial fiscal policy measures—both enacted and anticipated—along with appreciable support from monetary policy and the Fed- eral Reserve’s liquidity and lending facilities were ex- pected to continue bolstering the economic recovery, although a complete recovery was not expected by year- end. Inflation was projected to remain subdued this year, reflecting the substantial amount of slack in re- source utilization and the sizable declines in consumer energy prices earlier this year. The staff’s baseline as- sumptions were that the current restrictions on social in- teractions and business operations, along with voluntary social distancing by individuals, would ease gradually through next year. As a result, the rate of real GDP growth was projected to exceed potential output growth, the unemployment rate was expected to decline consid- erably, and inflation was forecast to pick back up over 2021 and 2022. The staff continued to observe that the uncertainty re- lated to the economic effects of the pandemic was ex- tremely elevated and that the unusual nature of the pan- demic-related shock made assessments about how the economy might evolve in the future more challenging than usual. In light of the significant uncertainty and downside risks associated with the course of the pan- demic and how long it would take the economy to re- cover, the staff still judged that a more pessimistic pro- jection was no less plausible than the baseline forecast. In this alternative scenario, an acceleration of the coro- navirus outbreak, with another round of strict limita- tions on social interactions and business operations, was assumed to begin later this year, leading to a decrease in real GDP, a jump in the unemployment rate, and re- newed downward pressure on inflation next year. Com- pared with the baseline, the disruption to economic ac- tivity was more severe and protracted in this scenario, with real GDP and inflation lower and the unemploy- ment rate higher by the end of the medium-term projec- tion. Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook Participants noted that the coronavirus pandemic was causing tremendous human and economic hardship across the United States and around the world. Follow- ing sharp declines, economic activity and employment had picked up somewhat in recent months but remained well below levels at the beginning of the year. Weaker demand and significantly lower oil prices were holding down consumer price inflation. Overall financial condi- tions had improved in recent months, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses. Participants agreed that the path of the economy would depend on the course of the virus, which was seen as highly uncer- tain. Participants noted that the rebound in consumer spend- ing from its trough in April had been particularly strong. Resumption in economic activity, as well as payments to households under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Eco- nomic Security (CARES) Act, had supported household income and consumer expenditures. Participants ob- served that with this rebound, household spending likely had recovered about half of its previous decline. Con- sumers’ purchases of goods—including motor vehicles, other durables, and especially goods sold online—had bounced back much more than their purchases of ser- vices, such as air travel, hotel accommodations, and res- taurant meals, which were disrupted significantly by so- cial distancing and other effects of the virus. With re- gard to the behavior of household spending in recent weeks, participants pointed to information from District contacts and high-frequency indicators (such as credit and debit card transactions and mobility indicators based on cellphone location tracking) as suggesting that in- creases in some consumer expenditures had likely slowed in reaction to the further spread of the virus. Participants noted that households’ spending on discre- Page 8 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ tionary services—such as leisure, travel, and hospital- ity—would likely be subdued for some time and thus would be a factor restraining the pace of recovery. In contrast to the sizable rebound in consumer spend- ing, participants saw less improvement in the business sector in recent months, and they noted that their Dis- trict business contacts continued to report extraordinar- ily high levels of uncertainty and risks. Several partici- pants relayed examples of some operational difficulties their business contacts were reportedly facing in the cur- rent environment. These difficulties included managing disruptions in supply chains, challenges associated with closure and reopening, and elevated employee absentee- ism in some cases. Furthermore, some participants noted that small businesses were under significant strain. Also, further near-term fiscal support was uncertain. Participants noted that, in light of conditions in the busi- ness sector, business investment spending continued to be subdued. Participants generally agreed that actions of consumers and businesses in taking steps to slow the spread of the virus, along with developments in public health, would be critical in ensuring a durable reopening of businesses. In addition, monetary policy and particu- larly fiscal policy would also play important roles in sup- porting business activity. Several participants also commented on ongoing chal- lenges facing the energy or farm sector despite recent improvements. In the energy sector, these challenges in- cluded still-low oil demand, excess inventories, and low oil prices, while in the farm sector they included low prices of some farm commodities, pandemic-related dis- ruptions in some food processing plants, and a signifi- cant decline in demand for ethanol. Regarding the labor market, many participants com- mented that the pace of employment gains, which was quite strong in May and June, had likely slowed. The increasing number of virus cases in many parts of the country had led to delays in some business reopenings and to some reclosures as well. The pace of declines in initial unemployment insurance claims had slowed in re- cent weeks, and claims remained at an elevated level. In addition, participants emphasized that the labor market was a long way from a full recovery even after the posi- tive May and June employment reports; these reports in- dicated that, through June, only about one-third of the roughly 22 million loss in jobs that occurred over March and April had been offset by subsequent gains. Partici- pants generally agreed that prospects for further sub- stantial improvement in the labor market would depend on a broad and sustained reopening of businesses. In turn, such a reopening would depend in large part on the efficacy of health measures taken to limit the spread of the virus. Participants also discussed the nature of the current sit- uation in the labor market. They noted that the down- turn in employment was concentrated among lower- wage and service-sector workers, many of whom were employed in industries most adversely affected by social- distancing measures. And with lower-wage and service- sector jobs disproportionately held by African Ameri- cans, Hispanics, and women, these portions of the pop- ulation were bearing a disproportionate share of the eco- nomic hardship caused by the pandemic. Participants noted that the fiscal support initiated in the spring through the CARES Act had been very important in granting some financial relief to millions of families. A number of participants observed that, with some provi- sions of the CARES Act set to expire shortly against the backdrop of a still-weak labor market, additional fiscal aid would likely be important for supporting vulnerable families, and thus the economy more broadly, in the pe- riod ahead. In their comments about inflation, participants generally judged that the negative effect of the pandemic on ag- gregate demand was more than offsetting upward pres- sures on some prices stemming from supply constraints or from higher demand for certain products, so that the overall effect of the pandemic on prices was seen as dis- inflationary. Recent low monthly readings of PCE prices suggested that the 12-month change measure of PCE price inflation would likely continue to run well below the Committee’s 2 percent objective for some time. Against this backdrop, a few participants noted a risk that longer-term inflation expectations might move be- low levels consistent with the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent objective. Participants also noted that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy would likely be needed for some time to support aggregate demand and achieve 2 percent inflation over the longer run. Participants observed that many measures of financial market functioning were indicating that improvements achieved since the extreme turbulence in March had been sustained. Actions by the Federal Reserve, includ- ing emergency lending facilities established with ap- proval of (and, in many cases, financial support from) the Treasury, had helped ease the strains in some finan- cial markets seen earlier in the year and were supporting the flow of credit to households, businesses, and com- munities. Participants observed that the volume of bor- _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Minutes of the Meeting of July 28–29, 2020 Page 9 rowing in recent months at many of the Federal Re- serve’s liquidity facilities had stayed low, reflecting im- proved availability of funding from market sources. And participants agreed that the Federal Reserve’s ongoing provision of backstop credit in various forms continued to be important to sustain the market improvements al- ready achieved. Participants observed that uncertainty surrounding the economic outlook remained very elevated, with the path of the economy highly dependent on the course of the virus and the public sector’s response to it. Several risks to the outlook were noted, including the possibility that additional waves of virus outbreaks could result in ex- tended economic disruptions and a protracted period of reduced economic activity. In such scenarios, banks and other lenders could tighten conditions in credit markets appreciably and restrain the availability of credit to households and businesses. Other risks cited included the possibility that fiscal support for households, busi- nesses, and state and local governments might not pro- vide sufficient relief of financial strains in these sectors and that some foreign economies could come under greater pressure than anticipated as a result of the spread of the pandemic abroad. Several participants noted po- tential longer-run effects of the pandemic associated with possible restructuring in some sectors of the econ- omy that could slow the growth of the economy’s pro- ductive capacity for some time. A number of participants commented on various poten- tial risks to financial stability. Banks and other financial institutions could come under significant stress, particu- larly if one of the more adverse scenarios regarding the spread of the virus and its effects on economic activity was realized. Nonfinancial corporations had carried high levels of indebtedness into the pandemic, increas- ing their risk of insolvency. There were also concerns that the anticipated increase in Treasury debt over the next few years could have implications for market func- tioning. There was general agreement that these institu- tions, activities, and markets should be monitored closely, and a few participants noted that improved data would be helpful for doing so. Several participants ob- served that the Federal Reserve had recently taken steps to help ensure that banks remain resilient through the pandemic, including by conducting additional sensitivity analysis in conjunction with the most recent bank stress tests and imposing temporary restrictions on share- holder payouts to preserve banks’ capital. A couple of participants noted that they believed that restrictions on shareholder payouts should be extended, while another judged that such a step would be premature. In their consideration of monetary policy at this meeting, participants reaffirmed their commitment to using the Federal Reserve’s full range of tools to support the U.S. economy during this challenging time, thereby promot- ing its maximum employment and price stability goals. They noted that the path of the economy would depend significantly on the course of the virus and that the on- going public health crisis would weigh heavily on eco- nomic activity, employment, and inflation in the near term and posed considerable risks to the economic out- look over the medium term. In light of this assessment, all participants considered it appropriate to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent. Furthermore, participants continued to judge that it would be appropriate to maintain this target range until they were confident that the economy had weathered re- cent events and was on track to achieve the Committee’s maximum employment and price stability goals. Participants also judged that, in order to continue to sup- port the flow of credit to households and businesses, it would be appropriate over coming months for the Fed- eral Reserve to increase its holdings of Treasury securi- ties and agency residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) and CMBS at least at the current pace. These actions would be helpful in sustaining smooth market functioning, thereby fostering the effective transmission of monetary policy to broader financial conditions. In addition, participants noted that it was appropriate that the Desk would continue to offer large-scale overnight and term repo operations. Participants observed that it would be important to continue to monitor develop- ments closely and that the Committee would be pre- pared to adjust its plans as appropriate. Participants discussed the current stance of monetary policy and the circumstances under which they might in- crease monetary policy accommodation or clarify their intentions regarding policy. Participants generally judged that the Committee’s policy actions over the past several months had provided substantial accommoda- tion; several of them observed that the Committee’s as- set purchases, which were designed to support financial market functioning and the smooth flow of credit, were likely also providing a degree of policy accommodation. Noting the increase in uncertainty about the economic outlook over the intermeeting period, several partici- pants suggested that additional accommodation could be required to promote economic recovery and return in- flation to the Committee’s 2 percent objective. Some participants observed that, due to the nature of the shock that the U.S. economy was experiencing, strong Page 10 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ fiscal policy support would be necessary to encourage expeditious improvements in labor market conditions. With regard to the outlook for monetary policy beyond this meeting, a number of participants noted that provid- ing greater clarity regarding the likely path of the target range for the federal funds rate would be appropriate at some point. Concerning the possible form that revised policy communications might take, these participants commented on outcome-based forward guidance—un- der which the Committee would undertake to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate at least until one or more specified economic outcomes was achieved—and also touched on calendar-based forward guidance—under which the current target range would be maintained at least until a particular calendar date. In the context of outcome-based forward guidance, various participants mentioned using thresholds calibrated to in- flation outcomes, unemployment rate outcomes, or combinations of the two, as well as combinations with calendar-based guidance. In addition, many participants commented that it might become appropriate to frame communications regarding the Committee’s ongoing as- set purchases more in terms of their role in fostering ac- commodative financial conditions and supporting eco- nomic recovery. More broadly, in discussing the policy outlook, a number of participants observed that com- pleting a revised Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy would be very helpful in providing an overarching framework that would help guide the Committee’s future policy actions and com- munications. A majority of participants commented on yield caps and targets—approaches that cap or target interest rates along the yield curve—as a monetary policy tool. Of those participants who discussed this option, most judged that yield caps and targets would likely provide only modest benefits in the current environment, as the Committee’s forward guidance regarding the path of the federal funds rate already appeared highly credible and longer-term interest rates were already low. Many of these participants also pointed to potential costs associ- ated with yield caps and targets. Among these costs, par- ticipants noted the possibility of an excessively rapid ex- pansion of the balance sheet and difficulties in the design and communication of the conditions under which such a policy would be terminated, especially in conjunction with forward guidance regarding the policy rate. In light of these concerns, many participants judged that yield caps and targets were not warranted in the current envi- ronment but should remain an option that the Commit- tee could reassess in the future if circumstances changed markedly. A couple of participants remarked on the value of yield caps and targets as a means of reinforcing forward guidance on asset purchases, thereby providing insurance against adverse movements in market expec- tations regarding the path of monetary policy, and as a tool that could help limit the amount of asset purchases that the Committee would need to make in pursuing its dual-mandate goals. Committee Policy Action In their discussion of monetary policy for this meeting, members agreed that the coronavirus outbreak was caus- ing tremendous human and economic hardship across the United States and around the world. Following sharp declines, economic activity and employment had picked up somewhat in recent months but remained well below their levels at the beginning of the year. Con- sumer price inflation was being held down by weaker de- mand and significantly lower oil prices. Overall financial conditions had improved, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households, businesses, and communities. Mem- bers agreed that the Federal Reserve was committed to using its full range of tools to support the U.S. economy in this challenging time, thereby promoting its maximum employment and price stability goals. Members stated that the path of the economy would de- pend significantly on the course of the virus. In addi- tion, members agreed that the ongoing public health cri- sis would weigh heavily on economic activity, employ- ment, and inflation in the near term and was posing con- siderable risks to the economic outlook over the me- dium term. In light of these developments, members decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent. Members stated that they ex- pected to maintain this target range until they were con- fident that the economy had weathered recent events and was on track to achieve the Committee’s maximum employment and price stability goals. Members agreed that they would continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the eco- nomic outlook—including information related to public health—as well as global developments and muted infla- tion pressures, and that they would use the Committee’s tools and act as appropriate to support the economy. In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the stance of monetary policy, members noted that they would assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to the Committee’s maximum-employment ob- jective and its symmetric 2 percent inflation objective. This assessment would take into account a wide range of _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Minutes of the Meeting of July 28–29, 2020 Page 11 information, including measures of labor market condi- tions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation ex- pectations, and readings on financial and international developments. To support the flow of credit to households and busi- nesses, members agreed that over coming months it would be appropriate for the Federal Reserve to increase its holdings of Treasury securities and agency RMBS and CMBS at least at the current pace to sustain smooth mar- ket functioning, thereby fostering effective transmission of monetary policy to broader financial conditions. In addition, members agreed that the Desk would continue to offer large-scale overnight and term repo operations. Members noted that they would closely monitor devel- opments and be prepared to adjust their plans as appro- priate. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the fol- lowing domestic policy directive, for release at 2:00 p.m.: “Effective July 30, 2020, the Federal Open Mar- ket Committee directs the Desk to: • Undertake open market operations as nec- essary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of 0 to ¼ percent. • Increase the System Open Market Account holdings of Treasury securities, agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS), and agency commercial mortgage-backed secu- rities (CMBS) at least at the current pace to sustain smooth functioning of markets for these securities, thereby fostering effective transmission of monetary policy to broader financial conditions. • Conduct term and overnight repurchase agreement operations to support effective policy implementation and the smooth functioning of short-term U.S. dollar fund- ing markets. • Conduct overnight reverse repurchase agreement operations at an offering rate of 0.00 percent and with a per-counterparty limit of $30 billion per day; the per-counter- party limit can be temporarily increased at the discretion of the Chair. • Roll over at auction all principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of Treasury securities and reinvest all principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s hold- ings of agency debt and agency MBS in agency MBS and all principal payments from holdings of agency CMBS in agency CMBS. • Allow modest deviations from stated amounts for purchases and reinvestments, if needed for operational reasons. • Engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settle- ment of the Federal Reserve’s agency MBS transactions.” The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below for release at 2:00 p.m.: “The Federal Reserve is committed to using its full range of tools to support the U.S. economy in this challenging time, thereby promoting its maximum employment and price stability goals. The coronavirus outbreak is causing tremen- dous human and economic hardship across the United States and around the world. Following sharp declines, economic activity and employ- ment have picked up somewhat in recent months but remain well below their levels at the beginning of the year. Weaker demand and sig- nificantly lower oil prices are holding down con- sumer price inflation.

The Committee expects to maintain this target range until it is confident that the economy has weathered re- cent events and is on track to achieve its maxi- mum employment and price stability goals. The Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook, including information re- lated to public health, as well as global develop- ments and muted inflation pressures, and will use its tools and act as appropriate to support Page 12 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ the economy. In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the stance of mon- etary policy, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its sym- metric 2 percent inflation objective. This as- sessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor mar- ket conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on fi- nancial and international developments. To support the flow of credit to households and businesses, over coming months the Federal Reserve will increase its holdings of Treasury se- curities and agency residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities at least at the cur- rent pace to sustain smooth market functioning, thereby fostering effective transmission of monetary policy to broader financial conditions. In addition, the Open Market Desk will con- tinue to offer large-scale overnight and term re- purchase agreement operations. The Commit- tee will closely monitor developments and is prepared to adjust its plans as appropriate.” Voting for this action: Jerome H. Powell, John C. Williams, Michelle W. Bowman, Lael Brainard, Richard H. Clarida, Patrick Harker, Robert S. Kaplan, Neel Kashkari, Loretta J. Mester, and Randal K. Quarles. Voting against this action: None. Consistent with the Committee’s decision to leave the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged, the Board of Governors voted unanimously to leave the in- terest rates on required and excess reserve balances at 0.10 percent. The Board of Governors also voted unan- imously to approve establishment of the primary credit rate at the existing level of 0.25 percent, effective July 30, 2020. It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Tuesday–Wednesday, Septem- ber 15–16, 2020. The meeting adjourned at 10:55 a.m. on July 29, 2020. Notation Vote By notation vote completed on June 30, 2020, the Com- mittee unanimously approved the minutes of the Com- mittee meeting held on June 9–10, 2020. _______________________ James A.

Chair Powell: “Thomas was unquestionably one of the great economic minds of his generation, and his re- search has been central to some of our biggest discussions and policy actions over the past sev- eral years. He had a rare and underappreciated gift for translating arcane and academic theory into real world practice. That ability made a real difference in the conduct and communication of monetary policy. From his work on r*, to the balance sheet, to leading the steering committee for our monetary policy review, Thomas Lau- bach’s intellectual fingerprints are all over the Committee’s decisions that will define this era of the Federal Reserve. Thomas was also an exceptional colleague, leader, and friend. No one here will be sur- prised to know that as condolences pour in, the admiration for his kindness and equanimity match, if not exceed, the esteem for his intellect. Thomas was a model of leadership who fiercely believed that every member of his team is criti- cal to our collective success, and he made cer- tain they knew it. Even as he battled his own health problems, working through treatment to help fight the economic fallout of a global pan- demic, his concern lay with others. Amid a del- uge of emergency work to fight a historic down- turn and the upending of daily life, Thomas urged people to take care of themselves and their families first. It is a testament to the mu- tual respect and amity that it was Thomas’s team who proposed the Tealbook dedication in his memory. As friends, colleagues, and collaborators, we all grieve his loss. His absence leaves a space that cannot truly be filled. We will miss Thomas Laubach’s intellect and his insight. More im- portantly, we will miss Thomas Laubach.” Vice Chair Williams: “Thomas and I started working together 20 years ago. He had just arrived at the Board from the Kansas City Fed, and I had returned from my stint at the Council of Economic Ad- visers. And it was truly serendipitous. We im- mediately recognized the shared interest in fig- uring out how to estimate this thing called the Page 2 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ natural rate of interest. And more importantly, Thomas was an expert in Kalman filtering. So we were off to the races on that project. Ironi- cally, given subsequent events, the question of the time was whether the productivity boom had driven r* higher. In fact, if you go back to our December 2000 memo, our first memo to the Board on r*, our original estimates had r* at 4¼ percent, and that’s real, not nominal. So that’s a 6¼ percent nominal r*. Those were the days. Jumping ahead 15 years, following his appoint- ment as Director of Monetary Affairs, Thomas would frequently, and very earnestly, ask me how he could be most effective in his role as an adviser to the FOMC. And I’d remind him that the Committee has at times been compared to a herd of cats. But he was always looking for ways to raise his game, and hopefully ours, and help the Committee grapple with issues and de- cisions before us. Sometimes that effort led to briefings with a labyrinth of charts and figures, where Thomas heroically tried to make sense of our Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) projections and the implicit policy rule that must be embedded in them if you only looked hard enough. Or it goes without saying how everything makes more sense once you factor in r*. His role as trusted adviser was never more on display or important than during the framework review as Chair Powell just commented. Thomas focused on making sure the Commit- tee was prepared with the very best information and analysis. He consistently moved us towards the goal line, even as he engaged in a complex range of issues and dealt with the effects of the pandemic. And he scrupulously played the role of honest broker throughout. Indeed, he per- fected the formula for herding cats. It’s one part keen intellect, a dollop of understated hu- mor, and a big helping of patience and persever- ance.” Governor Clarida: “Thomas Laubach was a remarkable human be- ing who just happened to be a world class econ- omist. His passing last week represents of course an incalculable loss for his family, but is also a devastating blow felt by each and every one of us in the Federal Reserve System, and indeed, in major central banks around the world that he frequently visited. Before I arrived at the Board, I knew Thomas primarily through his research. His book on in- flation targeting with Ben Bernanke, Rick Mish- kin, and Adam Posen is a classic reference on the subject, as is his work with President Wil- liams on r*. I would say Thomas had a talent for picking co-authors. Thomas and I first met when he was a Ph.D. student working on the book and we were both visiting the New York Fed. I remember well our first meeting 25 years ago, and I was struck then by Thomas’s enthusiasm that he brought to economics as a graduate stu- dent. Thomas of course never lost that spark and joy for the practice of monetary policy, and we are all fortunate that he did not. I—and I’m sure Chair Powell, and before him, Chair Yellen—trusted him implicitly. And speaking for myself, I always sought his insight and ad- vice privately in my office and counsel on all of the big policy decisions I’ve had to consider in my two years as Vice Chair. Thomas made everyone that he worked with better and inspired to put forth their best energy and effort to achieve larger goals. That was most certainly the case in the framework review, and I’ll second what Vice Chair Williams and Chair Powell said. Thomas brought peerless leadership, energy, and a commitment to the en- tire framework review. We simply would not have achieved the evolution of our framework and strategy without Thomas and the insight, inspiration, and good judgment he brought to the project and the ambitious process that he designed and worked with us to implement. I understand that in Thomas’s last days, he was able to watch the Chair’s speech at Jackson Hole rolling out the new framework, and that he was so proud to have been part of what the Wall Street Journal called a landmark change in U.S. monetary policy. I’m sure I speak for all of us when I conclude by saying that it is we who are proud to have had the privilege of working with Thomas Laubach during his 20 years at the Fed. He is and will be deeply missed, but his spirit and inspiration to us all will endure.” Minutes of the Meeting of September 15–16, 2020 Page 3 _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Developments in Financial Markets and Open Market Operations The System Open Market Account (SOMA) manager first discussed developments in financial markets. On net, financial conditions eased over the intermeeting pe- riod. Equity prices rose and the broad dollar continued to depreciate from its crisis-driven peak in March. Yields on Treasury inflation-protected securities fell, while longer-dated nominal Treasury yields increased modestly. Market participants attributed these developments to a stronger economic outlook, better news on the COVID- 19 trajectory, better-than-feared corporate earnings re- ports, and accommodative policy. Against this back- drop, most respondents to the Open Market Desk’s Sur- vey of Primary Dealers and Survey of Market Partici- pants perceived downside risks to U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) growth this year as having declined no- tably since the July survey, and their forecasts for overall growth for 2020 were revised up significantly. While the economic outlook had brightened, market participants continued to see significant risks ahead. Some noted concerns about elevated asset valuations in certain sectors. Many also cited geopolitical events as heightening uncertainty. In addition, most forecasters were assuming that an additional pandemic-related fiscal package would be approved this year, and noted that, absent a new package, growth could decelerate at a faster-than-expected pace in the fourth quarter. In light of these and other risks, as well as the ongoing pan- demic, market participants continued to suggest that the supportive policy environment and the backstops to market functioning remained important stabilizers. The release of the revised Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy (consensus state- ment) elicited relatively modest immediate reaction across markets. However, market participants generally viewed the completion of the review as an important milestone; many indicated that growing expectations for the Committee to adopt a flexible average-inflation- targeting regime had influenced asset prices over recent months. In particular, these expectations were viewed as contributing to the recent rise in far-forward measures of inflation compensation, though market participants noted that these measures were still somewhat low by historical standards. Market participants continued to anticipate that the Committee would update its forward guidance for the federal funds rate. Most respondents to the Desk’s sur- veys continued to indicate that they expected the FOMC to adopt outcome-based forward guidance linked to in- flation; some noted that employment measures could be part of the forward guidance as well. Survey respond- ents’ expectations for the economic conditions that would prevail when the FOMC first lifted the target range had shifted notably since the previous survey, with many respondents projecting somewhat higher inflation and lower unemployment than in July. Expectations for asset purchases this year remained tightly centered around the current pace; however, many survey re- spondents revised up the amount of asset purchases ex- pected in 2021 and 2022. The manager turned next to a discussion of funding mar- ket conditions and open market operations over the pe- riod. Conditions in short-term dollar funding markets remained stable over the period. Overnight secured and unsecured rates continued to trade in narrow ranges near the interest on excess reserves rate. Forward measures of funding rates implied that conditions were expected to remain stable in coming months. Markets for Treasury securities and agency mortgage- backed securities (MBS) continued to function smoothly, with bid-ask spreads and a range of other in- dicators remaining near pre-pandemic levels. Indicators of functioning in the market for agency commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) also remained sta- ble. In light of the improved conditions, the staff pro- posed that the Desk no longer be required to increase agency CMBS holdings or reinvest principal payments for agency CMBS. For the time being, the Desk would continue to conduct regular agency CMBS operations to maintain backstop capacity. By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk’s domestic transactions over the intermeeting period. There were no intervention operations in foreign curren- cies for the System’s account during the intermeeting pe- riod. Staff Review of the Economic Situation The COVID-19 pandemic and the measures undertaken to contain its spread continued to affect economic activ- ity in the United States and abroad. The information available at the time of the September 15–16 meeting suggested that U.S. real GDP was rebounding at a rapid rate in the third quarter. Labor market conditions con- tinued to improve markedly in July and August, but em- ployment was still below its level at the beginning of the year. Consumer price inflation—as measured by the 12-month percentage change in the price index for per- sonal consumption expenditures (PCE) through July— Page 4 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ remained well below the rates that prevailed early in the year. Total nonfarm payroll employment expanded strongly in July and August, although payrolls had retraced only about half of the jobs lost at the onset of the pandemic. The unemployment rate moved down further to 8.4 per- cent in August. The unemployment rates for African Americans, Asians, and Hispanics declined over the past two months but remained well above the national aver- age. The labor force participation rate rose, on net, and the employment-to-population ratio increased further in July and August. Initial claims for unemployment insur- ance benefits continued to move down, on net, through early September, but the pace of declines had slowed. In addition, weekly estimates of private-sector payrolls con- structed by the Board’s staff using data provided by the payroll processor ADP suggested that employment gains likely were still solid from mid-August to early Septem- ber. Total PCE price inflation was 1.0 percent over the 12 months ending in July, reflecting both weak aggregate demand and a considerable drop in consumer energy prices early this year. Core PCE price inflation, which excludes changes in consumer food and energy prices, was 1.3 percent over the same 12-month period. By comparison, the trimmed mean measure of 12-month PCE price inflation constructed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas was 1.8 percent in July. The consumer price index (CPI) increased 1.3 percent over the 12 months ending in August, while core CPI inflation was 1.7 percent over the same period. On a monthly basis, recent inflation readings were bolstered by in- creases in durable goods prices, largely reflecting the strong demand for consumer goods as household pur- chases shifted away from many consumer services. The latest readings on survey-based measures of longer-run inflation expectations moved up a bit but remained within their ranges in recent years. The University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers measure for the next 5 to 10 years edged up in July and August, and the three- year-ahead measure from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s Survey of Consumer Expectations also crept up over the past two months. Real PCE expanded strongly in July and continued to be bolstered by supportive fiscal and monetary policy ac- tions. In August, the components of retail sales used to estimate PCE, along with sales of light motor vehicles, increased further. However, recent high-frequency indi- cators of spending on some consumer services—such as restaurant dining, hotel accommodations, and air travel—were still subdued. Real disposable personal in- come was roughly flat in July, primarily reflecting further gains in wage and salary income that were largely offset by the waning of government transfer payments from their peak in the spring. Nevertheless, the personal sav- ing rate remained quite elevated. The consumer senti- ment measure from the Michigan survey edged up in August, while the Conference Board survey measure moved down; both measures continued to be below their levels at the beginning of the year. Housing-sector activity continued to expand, likely sup- ported by the effects of low interest rates. Starts and building permit issuance for single-family homes, along with starts of multifamily units, increased further in July. Sales of both new and existing homes also rose substan- tially further. These measures of construction and sales were generally at or near their pre-pandemic levels. Indicators of business fixed investment suggested that this sector was beginning to recover on balance. Nomi- nal new orders and shipments of nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft increased in July, the third con- secutive monthly increase in these indicators of business equipment spending. Many measures of business senti- ment also improved somewhat in July and August. In addition, the number of crude oil and natural gas rigs in operation through early September—an indicator of business spending on structures in the drilling and min- ing sector—had flattened out recently following its de- clines since the spring. In contrast, nominal business spending on nonresidential structures outside of the drilling and mining sector declined over June and July. Industrial production expanded further in July and Au- gust, although at a less rapid pace than over the preced- ing two months. The increase in factory output was broad based, but the gains for most manufacturing in- dustries had slowed gradually since June. Production in the mining sector—which includes crude oil and natural gas drilling and extraction—increased in July but fell in August, as Tropical Storm Marco and Hurricane Laura caused sharp but temporary decreases in extraction and drilling. Total real government purchases appeared to be increas- ing modestly, on balance, in the third quarter. Federal defense spending continued to rise through August, and federal employment was boosted markedly by temporary census-related hiring. State and local government pay- rolls expanded in July and August, although nominal state and local construction expenditures decreased in June and July. Minutes of the Meeting of September 15–16, 2020 Page 5 _____________________________________________________________________________________________ After declining sharply earlier this year, exports and im- ports of goods and services increased strongly in June and July. On net, over these two months, the nominal U.S. international trade deficit widened, as imports rose more than exports. Exports and imports of goods rose in June and July in most major product categories, while exports and imports of services rose modestly following previous historic declines. Foreign economic activity plunged in the second quarter as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the associ- ated restrictive measures to contain it. With some of these measures having been rolled back in recent months, economic indicators pointed to a large, but par- tial, rebound in most foreign economies in the third quarter. Recent indicators of household and business spending were strong in several economies (including Canada, the euro area, and Brazil), reflecting in part a boost from substantial government support programs. In China, economic indicators showed a continued moderate expansion after a sharp rebound in the second quarter, though gains in consumption continued to lag those in production and exports. Similarly, in Mexico, a strong rebound in manufacturing production contrasted with weak services activity. Despite the widespread re- bound in foreign activity indicators, a resurgence in COVID-19 cases in parts of Europe and Asia added un- certainty to the outlook for those economies. Recent readings of headline and core inflation abroad remained quite low, particularly in the advanced foreign econo- mies (AFEs), amid subdued demand pressures and lower energy prices from earlier this year. Staff Review of the Financial Situation Financial market sentiment improved over the inter- meeting period, boosted by declines in the number of new COVID-19 cases in the United States and stronger- than-anticipated corporate earnings reports and domes- tic economic data releases. Broad stock price indexes rose, on net, despite notable declines late in the inter- meeting period. Inflation compensation increased fur- ther, reaching pre-pandemic levels. Changes in other as- set prices were generally more modest but were con- sistent with improved sentiment: The Treasury yield curve steepened a little, spreads on speculative-grade corporate bonds narrowed moderately, and the ex- change value of the dollar depreciated modestly. Mean- while, financing conditions for businesses with access to capital markets and households with high credit scores remained broadly accommodative, although conditions remained tight for other borrowers. Yields on 2-year nominal Treasury securities were little changed since the July FOMC meeting, while 10- and 30-year yields rose moderately. Market commentary at- tributed the increases in longer-term yields to improved investor sentiment. This improved sentiment partly re- flected the decline in new COVID-19 cases in the United States and stronger-than-expected economic data, al- though market reactions to economic data releases were limited. The near-dated implied volatility on 10-year Treasury securities was little changed over the intermeet- ing period and remained near the bottom of its historical range. Measures of inflation compensation based on TIPS maturing over the next few years continued to in- crease, likely reflecting the general improvement in in- vestor sentiment accompanying the improvement in the economic outlook, some further improvements in TIPS market liquidity, and the higher-than-expected July CPI data release. The 5-year and 5-to-10-year measures of inflation compensation were close to their pre-pandemic levels but were still in the lower end of their historical ranges. The expected path for the federal funds rate over the next few years, as implied by a straight read of overnight index swap quotes, was little changed, on net, since the July FOMC meeting and remained close to the effective lower bound (ELB) through the first half of 2024. Com- munications about monetary policy over the intermeet- ing period generally had little effect on Treasury yields or the expected path of the federal funds rate. However, market participants suggested that building expectations that the Committee would move to a form of flexible average inflation targeting under the revised consensus statement had been a factor boosting TIPS inflation compensation over recent months. Broad stock price indexes rose, on net, during the inter- meeting period, consistent with generally better-than-ex- pected news on both the economy and second-quarter corporate earnings. One-month option-implied volatil- ity on the S&P 500—the VIX—was roughly unchanged, on net, although measures of longer-term downside risks in equity markets, such as the option-implied cost of in- suring against a 10 percent decline in the S&P 500 index in three months, increased somewhat. Spreads of invest- ment- and speculative-grade corporate bond yields over comparable-maturity Treasury yields narrowed some- what and remained near their historical medians. Conditions in short-term funding markets were stable over the intermeeting period. Spreads on commercial paper (CP) and negotiable certificates of deposit across different tenors changed little, on net, and remained Page 6 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ around levels observed before the pandemic. Total gross CP issuance also remained within pre-pandemic normal ranges, although outstanding volumes of nonfi- nancial CP declined moderately since the July FOMC meeting. Assets under management of prime and gov- ernment money market funds (MMFs) declined mod- estly on net. Partly reversing changes observed between April and July, institutional government MMFs, on net, decreased their holdings of Treasury securities and in- creased their holdings of repurchase agreements (repos) in August. The reversal was driven in part by a tighter spread between Treasury bill yields and repo rates. Amid normalizing market conditions, there was little activity in the Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility or the Commercial Paper Funding Facility. The effective federal funds rate and the Secured Over- night Financing Rate averaged 9 basis points over the intermeeting period. The amount of Federal Reserve repo outstanding remained at zero over the intermeeting period due to more attractive rates in the private market. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve increased holdings of Treasury securities and agency MBS at the same pace as during the previous intermeeting period. Foreign asset price movements were generally muted, with market participants likely weighing concerns over rising infection rates in some countries against the pro- spect of a COVID-19 vaccine. In emerging market economies (EMEs), Asian equity markets significantly outperformed Latin American counterparts, with Chi- nese equities showing particular strength. In most AFEs, equity indexes rose modestly and long-term sov- ereign yields edged higher. In line with the modest improvement in risk sentiment, the staff’s broad dollar index declined moderately, on net, with the dollar depreciating more against EME cur- rencies. The Chinese renminbi was boosted by better- than-expected Chinese economic data and was the most notable contributor to the decline in the staff’s trade- weighted dollar index, along with the Mexican peso. Among AFE currencies, the euro appreciated further and reached its highest level against the dollar since 2018. The pound was little changed, as some of its ear- lier appreciation against the dollar unwound amid a re- surgence of Brexit-related uncertainty. Financing conditions in capital markets remained ac- commodative over the intermeeting period. Amid his- torically low corporate bond yields, gross issuance of both investment- and speculative-grade corporate bonds was strong in July and August. Much of this recent issu- ance was intended to refinance existing debt. Gross in- stitutional leveraged loan issuance picked up slightly in July but remained below the levels observed during the same period last year. Amid notable equity market gains in August, gross equity issuance was robust, as seasoned offerings strengthened to about double their typical pace. Commercial and industrial loans outstanding de- clined in July and August, but at a slower pace than in June, with declines in large part reflecting continued credit-line repayment. The credit quality of nonfinancial corporations showed tentative signs of stabilization over the intermeeting pe- riod. The dollar volume of nonfinancial corporate bond downgrades continued to exceed upgrades, albeit only modestly, representing a sizable reduction in net down- grades since the spring. The pace of nonfinancial cor- porate bond defaults in July was also notably lower than in April and May but was still elevated relative to pre- pandemic levels. Default volumes fell further in August, reaching a level below the 2019 monthly average. Mar- ket indicators of future default expectations also im- proved somewhat. Financing conditions for small businesses remained tight, although some indicators pointed to a slight im- provement. Thirty-day delinquency rates fell modestly between May and July but remained comparable with early 2008 levels. The credit needs of small businesses remained high, with significant shares of respondents to the Census Bureau’s Small Business Pulse Survey report- ing scarce cash availability and anticipating a need for fi- nancial assistance in the next six months. Municipal market financing conditions remained accom- modative since the July FOMC meeting. However, the credit quality of municipal debt deteriorated somewhat, driven by a relatively large volume of credit rating down- grades of revenue bonds. Financing conditions for commercial real estate (CRE) intermediated through capital markets recovered further over the intermeeting period. Spreads on triple-B non- agency CMBS remained wide, though they continued to narrow through August, while triple-A spreads remained close to pre-pandemic levels. Issuance of non-agency CMBS was steady but subdued relative to pre-pandemic levels. Spreads on agency CMBS were tight and issuance was very strong, setting a new single-month record in July. In contrast, CRE loan growth at banks was weak in July and August, likely partly driven by the recovery of CMBS markets. Delinquency rates on mortgages backing CMBS fell a bit in July but remained high in the hotel and retail sectors. Minutes of the Meeting of September 15–16, 2020 Page 7 _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Financing conditions in the residential mortgage market were little changed over the intermeeting period. While mortgage rates hovered near historical lows, the spread between primary mortgage rates and MBS yields re- mained quite wide. Credit continued to flow to higher- score borrowers who met standard conforming loan cri- teria, while it remained tight for borrowers with lower credit scores and for nonstandard mortgage products. Nonetheless, low mortgage rates were supporting both home-purchase originations and refinancing. The credit quality of mortgages improved slightly, with the rate of transition into delinquency remaining near pre- pandemic levels and forbearance continuing to slowly decline. Financing conditions in consumer credit markets re- mained accommodative for borrowers with relatively strong credit scores but continued to be tight for sub- prime borrowers. Auto loan balances increased solidly overall but declined for borrowers with low credit scores. Credit card balances contracted at a slower rate in June and July than in the spring. However, offered interest rates rose and credit limits edged down for credit cards to nonprime borrowers. Conditions in the asset- backed securities (ABS) market were stable during the intermeeting period. ABS spreads edged down, and auto and student loan issuance was robust. Consumer credit performance remained stable, and the share of auto and credit card balances in forbearance declined. Staff Economic Outlook In the U.S. economic projection prepared by the staff for the September FOMC meeting, the rate of real GDP growth and the pace of declines in the unemployment rate were faster over the second half of this year than in the July forecast, primarily reflecting recent better-than- expected data. In addition, the inflation forecast for the rest of the year was revised up slightly, as some recent consumer goods prices were stronger than expected. Nevertheless, inflation was still projected to be subdued this year, reflecting substantial slack in resource utiliza- tion and the sizable declines in consumer energy prices earlier this year. Fiscal policy measures, along with the support from monetary policy and the Federal Reserve’s liquidity and lending facilities, were expected to continue supporting the second-half recovery, although the re- covery was forecast to be far from complete by year-end. The staff’s forecast assumed the enactment of some ad- ditional fiscal policy support this year; without that addi- tional policy action, the pace of the economic recovery would likely be slower. In the staff’s medium-term projection, the baseline as- sumptions included that the current restrictions on so- cial interactions and business operations, along with vol- untary social distancing by individuals and firms, would ease gradually through next year. In addition, the staff projection assumed that monetary policy would be even more accommodative than in the previous forecast in order to more fully reflect the revised consensus state- ment. Altogether, the rate of real GDP growth was pro- jected to exceed potential output growth, the unemploy- ment rate was expected to decline considerably further, and inflation was forecast to pick back up in 2021 through 2023. With the more-accommodative monetary policy assumed in the current forecast, which reflected the recent consensus statement, inflation was projected to moderately overshoot 2 percent for some time in the years beyond 2023. The staff continued to observe that the uncertainty re- lated to the course of the COVID-19 pandemic and its associated economic effects was extremely elevated and that the risks to the outlook were still tilted to the down- side. Given the apparent resilience of the U.S. economy to the acceleration in the spread of the pandemic during the summer, the staff judged that a significantly more pessimistic economic outcome, which the staff had pre- viously viewed as no less plausible than the baseline fore- cast and had featured a renewed downturn in economic activity, was now less likely than the baseline forecast. Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, participants submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and infla- tion for each year from 2020 through 2023 and over the longer run, based on their individual assessments of ap- propriate monetary policy—including the path for the federal funds rate. The longer-run projections repre- sented each participant’s assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy. These projections are described in the SEP, which is an addendum to these minutes. Participants noted that the COVID-19 pandemic was causing tremendous human and economic hardship across the United States and around the world. Eco- nomic activity and employment had picked up in recent months but remained well below their levels at the be- ginning of the year. Weaker demand and significantly Page 8 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ lower oil prices were holding down consumer price in- flation. Overall financial conditions had improved in re- cent months, in part reflecting policy measures to sup- port the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. house- holds and businesses. Participants agreed that the path of the economy would depend on the course of the virus and that the ongoing public health crisis would continue to weigh on economic activity, employment, and infla- tion in the near term and posed considerable risks to the economy’s medium-term outlook. Participants observed that the incoming data indicated that economic activity was recovering faster than ex- pected from its depressed second-quarter level, when much of the economy was shut down to stem the spread of the virus. In particular, with the reopening of many businesses and fewer people withdrawing from social in- teractions, consumer spending was rebounding sharply and appeared to have recovered about three-fourths of its earlier decline. Prior fiscal policy actions were seen as having supported the ability and willingness of house- holds to spend, although most participants expressed concern about the expiration of the enhanced unem- ployment insurance benefits from the CARES Act (Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act) and judged that additional fiscal relief would help sustain the recovery in household spending. Indeed, many par- ticipants noted that their economic outlook assumed ad- ditional fiscal support and that if future fiscal support was significantly smaller or arrived significantly later than they expected, the pace of the recovery could be slower than anticipated. Participants also viewed accom- modative monetary policy as contributing to gains in res- idential investment as well as consumer purchases of motor vehicles and other durable goods. While partici- pants pointed to strength in consumers’ purchases of goods, especially those sold online, they noted that out- lays for services had been slower to recover, particularly for items such as air travel, hotel accommodations, and restaurant meals, which had been significantly disrupted by social-distancing measures. Participants generally ex- pected spending on these services to remain subdued for some time and thus to be a restraining factor on the pace of the recovery. A few participants raised the possibility that the unwinding of the large pool of household sav- ings accumulated during the pandemic could provide greater-than-anticipated momentum to consumption going forward. However, a couple of other participants judged that if this savings reflected reduced spending on in-person services by high-income consumers, it was un- likely to provide much momentum to future consump- tion. Participants noted that business investment, which had plummeted in the second quarter, appeared to have be- gun to turn around. They pointed to data showing gains in capital goods orders and shipments as well as im- proved business sentiment. A number of participants judged that low interest rates were supporting business investment. However, the recovery was viewed as une- venly distributed across industries. While many business contacts reported progress on adapting to the pandemic, others noted that industries that relied more on person- to-person interactions continued to struggle. Business contacts with ties to the motor vehicle or housing indus- tries indicated increased activity, while those closer to the aviation, hospitality, and nonresidential construction industries were not seeing much of a recovery. Contacts continued to report ongoing stresses in the energy sec- tor, as well as challenges in the agricultural sector even though some crop prices had risen recently as sales to China increased. Although business contacts indicated that overall busi- ness activity had been stronger than they expected, it re- mained well below pre-pandemic levels. Business con- tacts pointed to several factors that could restrain further recovery, including high levels of uncertainty that were reportedly still holding back hiring and capital spending. Some contacts reported difficulties in managing disrup- tions in supply chains as well as elevated levels of em- ployee absenteeism because of the pandemic. Addition- ally, District contacts indicated that fiscal policy had helped support small businesses, while federal aid pay- ments had helped support farm incomes. Participants observed that labor market conditions con- tinued to improve in recent months and that the econ- omy through August had regained roughly half of the 22 million jobs that were lost in March and April. The gains in employment over July and August were gener- ally seen as larger than anticipated. Participants judged, however, that the labor market was a long way from be- ing fully recovered. They generally agreed that prospects for a further substantial improvement in the labor mar- ket would depend on a broad and sustained reopening of businesses, which in turn would depend importantly on how safe individuals felt to reengage in a wide range of activities. Some participants noted that the majority of gains in employment so far reflected workers on tem- porary layoffs returning to work. These participants judged it as less likely for future job gains to continue at their recent pace, because a greater share of the remain- ing layoffs might become permanent. Workers facing permanent layoffs were seen as more likely to need to find new jobs in different industries, and this process Minutes of the Meeting of September 15–16, 2020 Page 9 _____________________________________________________________________________________________ could take time, especially to the extent that these work- ers needed to be retrained. Participants observed that lower-paid workers had been disproportionally affected by the economic effects of the pandemic. Many of these workers were employed in the service sector or other industries most adversely affected by social-distancing measures. With a disproportionate share of service-sector jobs held by African Americans, Hispanics, and women, these groups were seen as being especially hard hit by the economic hardships caused by the pandemic. Participants viewed fiscal support from the CARES Act as having been very important in bol- stering the financial situations of millions of families, and a number of participants judged that the absence of fur- ther fiscal support would exacerbate economic hard- ships in minority and lower-income communities. In ad- dition, several participants observed that the effects of the pandemic were disrupting the supply of labor be- cause of the need to care for children, many of whom were attending school virtually from home. In their comments about inflation, participants noted that consumer prices had increased more quickly than expected in recent months and that market-based measures of inflation compensation had increased mod- erately over the intermeeting period, although they re- mained low. The upturn in consumer prices was primar- ily attributed to price increases in sectors such as con- sumer durables in which demand had risen after experi- encing a large decline earlier this spring. Nevertheless, inflation remained subdued, and participants still gener- ally judged that the overall effect of the pandemic on prices was disinflationary. While the outlook for infla- tion was viewed as highly uncertain, a number of partic- ipants projected that inflation would run below the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run objective for a signif- icant period before moving moderately above 2 percent for some time—consistent with the Committee’s revised consensus statement. Participants noted that financial conditions were gener- ally accommodative and that actions by the Federal Re- serve, including the establishment of emergency lending facilities in conjunction with the Treasury, were support- ing the flow of credit to households, businesses, and communities. While these actions as well as prompt and forceful monetary policy measures in response to the pandemic were viewed as contributing to accommoda- tive financial conditions, participants noted important differences in credit quality and credit availability across borrowers. While the pace of corporate downgrades was seen as having decreased significantly in recent months, the delinquency rates on business loans had risen notice- ably. Bank contacts reported ample capacity to lend to creditworthy borrowers; however, surveys of credit availability indicated that bank lending was tight. Fur- thermore, several participants noted the stress that small- and medium-sized banks could face from defaults on loans to small businesses and CRE properties if peo- ple continued to withdraw from travel and shopping ac- tivities. Additionally, a couple of participants indicated that highly accommodative financial market conditions could lead to excessive risk-taking and to a buildup of financial imbalances. Participants continued to see the uncertainty surround- ing the economic outlook as very elevated, with the path of the economy highly dependent on the course of the virus; on how individuals, businesses, and public officials responded to it; and on the effectiveness of public health measures to address it. Participants cited several down- side risks that could threaten the recovery. While the risk of another broad economic shutdown was seen as having receded, participants remained concerned about the possibility of additional virus outbreaks that could undermine the recovery. Such scenarios could result in increases in bankruptcies and defaults, put stress on the financial system, and lead to disruptions in the flow of credit to households and businesses. Most participants raised the concern that fiscal support so far for house- holds, businesses, and state and local governments might not provide sufficient relief to these sectors. A couple of participants saw an upside risk that further fiscal stim- ulus could be larger than anticipated, though it might come later than had been expected. Several participants raised concerns regarding the longer-run effects of the pandemic, including how it could lead to a restructuring in some sectors of the economy that could slow employ- ment growth or could accelerate technological disrup- tion that was likely limiting the pricing power of firms. In their consideration of monetary policy at this meeting, participants reaffirmed that they were committed to us- ing the Federal Reserve’s full range of tools in order to support the U.S. economy during this challenging time, thereby promoting the Committee’s statutory goals of maximum employment and price stability. They also noted that the path of the economy would depend sig- nificantly on the course of the virus and that the ongoing public health crisis would continue to weigh on eco- nomic activity, employment, and inflation in the near term and posed considerable risks to the economic out- look over the medium term. Page 10 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ All participants agreed that the completion of the frame- work review and the publication of the revised consen- sus statement provided a strong foundation for mone- tary policy decisions and communications going for- ward. Accordingly, participants agreed that it would be appropriate to incorporate some key elements of the re- vised consensus statement into the FOMC statement to be released following this meeting. In particular, partic- ipants reiterated their commitment to achieve maximum employment and an inflation rate of 2 percent over the longer run. With inflation running persistently below its longer-run goal, participants judged that it would be ap- propriate to aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation would average 2 percent over time and longer-term inflation expecta- tions would remain well anchored at 2 percent. Against this backdrop, participants discussed a range of issues associated with providing greater clarity about the likely path of the federal funds rate in the years ahead. Most participants supported providing more explicit outcome-based forward guidance for the federal funds rate that included establishing criteria for lifting the fed- eral funds rate above the ELB in terms of the paths for employment or inflation or both. Among the partici- pants who favored providing more explicit forward guidance at this meeting, all but a couple supported a formulation in which the forward guidance included lan- guage indicating that it would likely be appropriate to maintain the current target range until labor market con- ditions were judged to be consistent with the Commit- tee’s assessments of maximum employment and infla- tion had risen to 2 percent and was on track to moder- ately exceed 2 percent for some time. These participants noted that communicating that the target range for the federal funds rate would remain at the ELB until these criteria were achieved would provide appropriately clear and strong policy guidance. Doing so at this meeting was viewed as an especially important way of affirming the Committee’s commitment to achieving the eco- nomic outcomes articulated in the consensus statement. Participants generally noted that outcome-based for- ward guidance for the federal funds rate of this type was not an unconditional commitment to a particular path. Indeed, outcome-based guidance of this type would al- low the public to infer changes in the Committee’s as- sessment of how long the target range for the federal funds rate would remain at its current setting. Infor- mation pointing to a weaker outlook for the economy and inflation would tend to lead to public expectations for a longer period at the current setting of the target range while information suggesting a stronger outlook for the economy and inflation would tend to lead to ex- pectations for a shorter period at the current setting. In addition, circumstances could arise in which the Com- mittee judged that it would be appropriate to change its guidance, particularly if risks emerged that could impede the attainment of its economic objectives. A couple of participants preferred even stronger, and less qualified, outcome-based forward guidance that they judged would more clearly convey the Committee’s commitment to its objectives and to the strategic ap- proach that was articulated in the revised consensus statement. In particular, these participants preferred for- ward guidance in which the target range for the federal funds rate remained at the ELB until inflation had moved above 2 percent for some time. Especially in light of the lengthy period in which inflation has run be- low the Committee’s longer-run 2 percent objective, these participants judged that it was critical to demon- strate the Committee’s commitment to achieve out- comes in which inflation averages 2 percent over time. Several participants noted that while they agreed it was appropriate to incorporate key elements of the consen- sus statement into the postmeeting statement, they pre- ferred to retain forward guidance similar to that pro- vided in recent FOMC statements. These participants judged that it would likely be appropriate to maintain an accommodative stance of policy for some time in order to foster outcomes consistent with the Committee’s re- vised consensus statement. However, with longer-term interest rates already very low, there did not appear to be a need for enhanced forward guidance at this juncture or much scope for forward guidance to put additional downward pressure on yields. Moreover, these partici- pants were concerned that forward guidance that in- volved the target range for the federal funds rate remain- ing at the ELB until employment and inflation criteria were achieved could limit the Committee’s flexibility for years. Furthermore, by influencing expectations for the path of short-term interest rates, such guidance could contribute to a buildup of financial imbalances that would make it more difficult for the Committee to achieve its objectives in the future. Regarding asset purchases, participants judged that it would be appropriate over coming months for the Fed- eral Reserve to increase its holdings of Treasury securi- ties and agency MBS at least at the current pace. These actions would continue to help sustain smooth market functioning and would continue to help foster accom- modative financial conditions, thereby supporting the Minutes of the Meeting of September 15–16, 2020 Page 11 _____________________________________________________________________________________________ flow of credit to households and businesses. Some par- ticipants also noted that in future meetings it would be appropriate to further assess and communicate how the Committee’s asset purchase program could best support the achievement of the Committee’s maximum- employment and price-stability goals. Participants widely echoed the remarks at the opening of the meeting in memory of Thomas Laubach. Partici- pants universally recognized his great leadership and in- tellectual contributions to the work of the Committee as well as his warm and generous spirit. Committee Policy Action In their discussion of monetary policy for this meeting, members agreed that the COVID-19 pandemic was causing tremendous human and economic hardship across the United States and around the world. They noted that economic activity and employment had picked up in recent months but remained well below their levels at the beginning of the year, and that weaker demand and significantly lower oil prices were holding down consumer price inflation. Overall, financial con- ditions had improved in recent months, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses. Members agreed that the Federal Reserve was committed to using its full range of tools to support the U.S. economy in this challenging time, thereby promoting its maximum-em- ployment and price-stability goals. Members also stated that the path of the economy would depend significantly on the course of the virus. In addition, members agreed that the ongoing public health crisis would continue to weigh on economic activity, employment, and inflation in the near term and was posing considerable risks to the economic outlook over the medium term. All members agreed to incorporate into the postmeeting statement key elements of the Committee’s revised Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy. Members judged that this action would under- score the Committee’s strong commitment to the goals and strategy articulated in the new consensus statement in pursuit of the Committee’s statutory objectives. Ac- cordingly, members agreed that the FOMC statement should note that the Committee seeks to achieve maxi- mum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run and that, with inflation running per- sistently below this longer-run goal, the Committee will aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and longer-term inflation expectations remain well an- chored at 2 percent. Members generally expected that it would be appropriate to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these outcomes were achieved. All members agreed to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent. Almost all members viewed this meeting as the appropriate time to modify forward guidance to provide greater clarity regarding the likely future path of the federal funds rate. To this end, almost all members agreed on a specification for out- come-based forward guidance that indicated that the Committee expects that it will be appropriate to main- tain the current setting of the target range for the federal funds rate until labor market conditions had reached lev- els consistent with the Committee’s assessments of max- imum employment and inflation had risen to 2 percent and was on track to run moderately in excess of 2 per- cent for some time. Two members dissented from the policy decision. One of these dissenting members pre- ferred that the Committee retain greater policy rate flex- ibility by retaining the language in the forward guidance provided in the July postmeeting statement; that lan- guage noted that it would be appropriate to maintain the current target range until the Committee was confident that the economy had weathered recent events and was on track to achieve its maximum employment and price stability goals. The other dissenting member preferred a stronger formulation for the forward guidance—one in which the Committee would indicate that it expected to maintain the current target range until core inflation had reached 2 percent on a sustained basis. In their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, members generally agreed that the Committee’s policy guidance expressed its assessment about the path for the federal funds rate most likely to be consistent with achievement of the Committee’s goals, but that it was not an unconditional commitment. They stated that the appropriate rate path would depend on the evolution of the economic outlook. Accordingly, they agreed that the Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of policy as appropriate in the event that risks emerged that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals. Members also agreed that, in assessing the appro- priate stance of monetary policy, they would take into account a wide range of information, including readings on public health, labor market conditions, inflation pres- sures and inflation expectations, and financial and inter- national developments. Members noted that the Committee’s asset purchases had helped foster significant improvements in market functioning over recent months. In addition, purchases Page 12 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ of securities were contributing to accommodative finan- cial conditions in a way that supported economic recov- ery. Consistent with these observations, members agreed that it would be appropriate to acknowledge in the postmeeting statement the role of asset purchases in supporting accommodative financial conditions. The Committee’s statement thus indicated that over coming months it would be appropriate for the Federal Reserve to increase its holdings of Treasury securities and agency MBS at least at the current pace to sustain smooth mar- ket functioning and to help foster accommodative finan- cial conditions, thereby supporting the flow of credit to households and businesses. Members considered the staff proposal to eliminate the requirement in the directive to increase the holdings of agency CMBS in the SOMA portfolio. In light of the substantial improvement in market functioning in the agency CMBS market, the Committee judged that it would be appropriate for the Desk to purchase agency CMBS only as needed to sustain smooth market func- tioning, rather than seek to steadily increase agency CMBS holdings, and to cease reinvestments of agency CMBS principal payments. Members also concluded that, in light of ongoing low take-up at Desk repo oper- ations, it was not necessary to include a sentence on these operations in the FOMC statement. However, the directive adopted by the Committee continued to direct the Desk to conduct overnight and term repo operations to support effective policy implementation and smooth functioning of short-term U.S. dollar funding markets. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the fol- lowing domestic policy directive, for release at 2:00 p.m.: “Effective September 17, 2020, the Federal Open Market Committee directs the Desk to: • Undertake open market operations as nec- essary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of 0 to ¼ percent. • Increase the System Open Market Ac- count holdings of Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) at the current pace. Increase holdings of Treasury securities and agency MBS by ad- ditional amounts and purchase agency commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) as needed to sustain smooth func- tioning of markets for these securities. • Conduct term and overnight repurchase agreement operations to support effective policy implementation and the smooth functioning of short-term U.S. dollar funding markets. • Conduct overnight reverse repurchase agreement operations at an offering rate of 0.00 percent and with a per-counterparty limit of $30 billion per day; the per-coun- terparty limit can be temporarily increased at the discretion of the Chair. • Roll over at auction all principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of Treasury securities and reinvest all princi- pal payments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of agency debt and agency MBS in agency MBS. • Allow modest deviations from stated amounts for purchases and reinvestments, if needed for operational reasons. • Engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate set- tlement of the Federal Reserve’s agency MBS transactions.” The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below for release at 2:00 p.m.: “The Federal Reserve is committed to using its full range of tools to support the U.S. economy in this challenging time, thereby promoting its maximum employment and price stability goals. The COVID-19 pandemic is causing tremen- dous human and economic hardship across the United States and around the world. Economic activity and employment have picked up in re- cent months but remain well below their levels at the beginning of the year. Weaker demand and significantly lower oil prices are holding down consumer price inflation. Overall finan- cial conditions have improved in recent months, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. house- holds and businesses. The path of the economy will depend signifi- cantly on the course of the virus. The ongoing public health crisis will continue to weigh on economic activity, employment, and inflation in the near term, and poses considerable risks to the economic outlook over the medium term. Minutes of the Meeting of September 15–16, 2020 Page 13 _____________________________________________________________________________________________ The Committee seeks to achieve maximum em- ployment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. With inflation running per- sistently below this longer-run goal, the Com- mittee will aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent. The Committee expects to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these outcomes are achieved. The Com- mittee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and expects it will be appropriate to maintain this target range until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee’s assessments of maximum employment and in- flation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time. In addition, over coming months the Federal Re- serve will increase its holdings of Treasury secu- rities and agency mortgage-backed securities at least at the current pace to sustain smooth mar- ket functioning and help foster accommodative financial conditions, thereby supporting the flow of credit to households and businesses. In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals. The Committee’s assessments will take into account a wide range of information, in- cluding readings on public health, labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation ex- pectations, and financial and international de- velopments.” Voting for this action: Jerome H. Powell, John C. Williams, Michelle W. Bowman, Lael Brainard, Richard H. Clarida, Patrick Harker, Loretta J. Mester, and Randal K. Quarles. Voting against this action: Robert S. Kaplan and Neel Kashkari. President Kaplan dissented because he expects that it will be appropriate to maintain the current target range until the Committee is confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve its maximum employment and price stability goals as artic- ulated in its new policy strategy statement, but prefers that the Committee retain greater policy rate flexibility beyond that point. President Kashkari dissented be- cause he prefers that the Committee indicate that it ex- pects to maintain the current target range until core in- flation has reached 2 percent on a sustained basis. Consistent with the Committee’s decision to leave the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged, the Board of Governors voted unanimously to leave the in- terest rates on required and excess reserve balances at 0.10 percent. The Board of Governors also voted unan- imously to approve establishment of the primary credit rate at the existing level of 0.25 percent, effective Sep- tember 17, 2020. It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Wednesday–Thursday, November 4– 5, 2020. The meeting adjourned at 11:00 a.m. on Sep- tember 16, 2020. Notation Votes By notation vote completed on August 18, 2020, the Committee unanimously approved the minutes of the Committee meeting held on July 28–29, 2020. By notation vote completed on August 27, 2020, the Committee unanimously approved updates to its State- ment on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strat- egy. In conjunction with the notation vote, all non- voting participants also expressed support for the up- dated statement. _______________________ James A. Clouse Secretary Page 14 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Summary of Economic Projections In conjunction with the Federal Open Market Commit- tee (FOMC) meeting held on September 15–16, 2020, meeting participants submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real gross domestic product (GDP) growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation for each year from 2020 to 2023 and over the longer run. Each participant’s projections were based on infor- mation available at the time of the meeting, together with her or his assessment of appropriate monetary policy— including a path for the federal funds rate and its longer- run value—and assumptions about other factors likely to affect economic outcomes. The longer-run projec- tions represent each participant’s assessment of the value to which each variable would be expected to con- verge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy.1 “Ap- propriate monetary policy” is defined as the future path of policy that each participant deems most likely to fos- ter outcomes for economic activity and inflation that best satisfy his or her individual interpretation of the statutory mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability. The current projections for real activity, the labor mar- ket, and inflation were notably stronger than the projec- tions in the June 2020 Summary of Economic Projec- tions (SEP) for the overlapping years from 2020 to 2022. Participants revised up their economic outlook in light of the stronger-than-expected rebound in economic ac- tivity over recent months, although they noted that they remained attentive to the effects of the COVID-19 pan- demic and the measures taken to contain it. Table 1 and figure 1 provide summary statistics for the projections. Almost all participants projected that real GDP will con- tract in 2020, with the median participant seeing a milder contraction relative to the median projection in the June SEP. Additionally, almost all participants projected that real GDP would grow faster than their estimates of its longer-run normal growth rate from 2021 to 2023. All participants projected that the unemployment rate in the final quarter of 2020 would be notably lower than they had projected in June and that the unemployment rate would decline gradually during the forecast period. Most participants expected that a full economic recovery would take some time, and many projected that the un- employment rate in the final quarter of 2023 would be 1 One participant did not submit longer-run projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, or the federal funds rate. slightly below its estimated longer-run level. A vast ma- jority of participants projected that total inflation, as measured by the four-quarter percent change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE), would be at or below the FOMC’s 2 percent longer-run inflation objective throughout the forecast period. Pro- jections for core PCE price inflation, which excludes consumer food and energy prices, generally followed a similar trajectory. As shown in figure 2, most participants indicated that their expectations regarding the evolution of the econ- omy, relative to the Committee’s maximum- employment and price-stability objectives, would likely warrant keeping the federal funds rate at its current level through at least the end of 2023. The median of partic- ipants’ assessments of the longer-run level for the federal funds rate was unchanged from its value in the June SEP. Amid uncertainty about the course of the pandemic and its effects on the economy, all participants continued to regard the uncertainties surrounding the economic out- look as higher than the average over the past 20 years. In addition, a substantial majority of participants as- sessed the risks to their outlook for real GDP growth as weighted to the downside and the risks to their unem- ployment rate projections as weighted to the upside. The risks to inflation projections were judged as weighted to the downside by a substantial majority of participants. The Outlook for Real GDP Growth and the Unem- ployment Rate As shown in figure 3.A, almost all participants continued to project that real GDP would decline in 2020, with the median projection anticipating a decrease of 3.7 percent. Nevertheless, these projections were substantially stronger than those from the June SEP, when the me- dian participant expected real GDP to contract 6.5 per- cent. These revisions, in part, reflect the stronger-than- expected incoming data since June. Almost all partici- pants expected that the rate of real GDP growth from 2021 to 2023 would be above their estimates of its longer-run pace, with the median projections being 4.0 percent, 3.0 percent, and 2.5 percent in these years, respectively.

PCE inﬂation and core PCE inﬂation are the percentage rates of change in, respectively, the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE) and the price index for PCE excluding food and energy. Projections for the unemployment rate are for the average civilian unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of the year indicated. Each participant’s projections are based on his or her assessment of appropriate monetary policy. Longer-run projections represent each participant’s assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy. The projections for the federal funds rate are the value of the midpoint of the projected appropriate target range for the federal funds rate or the projected appropriate target level for the federal funds rate at the end of the speciﬁed calendar year or over the longer run. The June projections were made in conjunction with the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee on June 9–10, 2020. One participant did not submit longer-run projections for the change in real GDP, the unemployment rate, or the federal funds rate in conjunction with the June 9–10, 2020, meeting, and one participant did not submit such projections in conjunction with the September 15–16, 2020, meeting. 1. For each period, the median is the middle projection when the projections are arranged from lowest to highest. When the number of projections is even, the median is the average of the two middle projections. 2.

Summary of Economic Projections of the Meeting of September 15–16, 2020 Page 5 _____________________________________________________________________________________________ ___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ growth in the longer run was little changed from the June SEP, although the median projection ticked up to 1.9 percent. Reflecting better-than-expected incoming data since June, participants revised down their projections for the unemployment rate considerably through 2022, the fore- cast period in the June SEP (figure 3.B). The projections for the unemployment rate in the final quarter of this year ranged from 6.5 to 8.0 percent, with a median of 7.6 percent, and the ranges for projections from 2020 to 2022 all narrowed considerably since June. The median projected levels of the unemployment rate in the final quarters of 2021 and 2022—at 5.5 percent and 4.6 per- cent, respectively—were above the median estimate of the longer-run normal rate of unemployment of 4.1 per- cent. However, the median projection of the unemploy- ment rate in the final quarter of 2023, at 4.0 percent, was slightly below the median estimate of its longer-run value. The distribution of estimates for the longer-run unem- ployment rate was unchanged from the June SEP. Many participants indicated that they were still assessing whether the sharp contraction in economic activity dur- ing the first half of this year was likely to leave a lasting imprint on the labor market or the productive capacity of the economy. The Outlook for Inflation As shown in figures 3.C and 3.D, almost all participants revised up their projections for inflation in 2020 relative to their June projections, with the median projections for total and core inflation at 1.2 percent and 1.5 percent, respectively. Most participants expected inflation to rise over the next three years, although about half of them expected PCE price inflation to still fall short of the Committee’s longer-run 2 percent inflation objective by the end of the forecast horizon. A few participants pro- jected inflation to move above 2 percent before return- ing to 2 percent by 2023. A few participants expected inflation to move above its longer-run level in 2023, and several participants mentioned that they would expect inflation to rise above 2 percent in the years after. 2 As a reference, table 2 provides estimates of the forecast un- certainty for the change in real GDP, the unemployment rate, and total consumer price inflation over the period from 2000 through 2019. At the end of this summary, the box “Forecast Uncertainty” discusses the sources and interpretation of un- certainty in the economic forecasts and explains the approach used to assess the uncertainty and risks attending participants’ projections. Appropriate Monetary Policy As shown in figure 3.E, most participants projected that it would be appropriate to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent through at least the end of 2023. Most participants noted that their as- sessment of appropriate monetary policy took into ac- count the new Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy. In particular, because infla- tion has been running persistently below 2 percent, par- ticipants mentioned that they linked their assessment of the appropriate path of the federal funds rate to their assessment of shortfalls of employment from the Com- mittee’s maximum-employment objective and to a mod- erate rise in inflation above 2 percent to help anchor in- flation expectations at the Committee’s 2 percent longer- run goal. The median of participants’ estimates of the longer-run level of the federal funds rate was unchanged from June at 2.50 percent. Uncertainty and Risks In assessing the appropriate path for monetary policy, FOMC participants take account of the range of possible economic outcomes, the likelihood of those outcomes, and the potential benefits and costs should they occur. As shown in the panels on the left side of figure 4, almost all participants continued to view the current uncertainty surrounding each of the four economic variables—real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, total PCE infla- tion, and core PCE inflation—as being greater than the average over the past 20 years.2 A substantial majority of participants judged the risks to their projections for real GDP growth as weighted to the downside and the risks to their unemployment rate pro- jections as weighted to the upside (figure 4). A substan- tial majority of participants viewed the risks to their in- flation projections as weighted to the downside. In discussing the uncertainty and risks surrounding their economic projections, the course of the pandemic con- tinued to be mentioned as a key source of uncertainty. The possibility of another wave of contagion and delays in developing a vaccine were seen as potential downside risks to the economic outlook. As for upside risks, par- ticipants mentioned the possibility of faster-than- Previous SEP addendums to the FOMC minutes contained figures showing the median projections along with confidence intervals based on historical forecast errors. As the level of uncertainty about the economic outlook is currently judged to be higher than its historical average because of uncertainty about the course of the coronavirus and its effects on the economy, these “fan charts” have been omitted from this ad- dendum.

As described in the box “Forecast Uncertainty,” under certain assump- tions, there is about a 70 percent probability that actual outcomes for real GDP, unemployment, consumer prices, and the federal funds rate will be in ranges implied by the average size of projection errors made in the past.

Definitions of variables are in the general note to table 1. 2. Measure is the overall consumer price index, the price measure that has been most widely used in government and private economic forecasts. Projections are percent changes on a fourth quarter to fourth quarter basis. 3. For Federal Reserve staff forecasts, measure is the federal funds rate. For other forecasts, measure is the rate on 3-month Treasury bills. Projection errors are calculated using average levels, in percent, in the fourth quarter. anticipated progress in dealing with the disease and bet- ter-targeted measures in responding to the virus. Partic- ipants also pointed to a number of other risks, including the extent and timing of additional fiscal support, the magnitude of supply-side disruptions associated with postponements of in-class school openings and small business closings, the likelihood of elevated levels of business bankruptcies, and credit quality problems that could potentially curtail lending. Several participants also expressed concerns about global geopolitical devel- opments and related tensions as well as prolonged reces- sionary dynamics such as labor market scarring or infla- tion persistently undershooting the Committee’s longer- run goal. Participants’ assessments of the appropriate future path of the federal funds rate are also subject to considerable uncertainty. Because the Committee adjusts monetary policy in response to actual and prospective develop- ments over time in key economic variables—such as real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation— uncertainty surrounding the projected path for the fed- eral funds rate importantly reflects the uncertainties about the paths for these economic variables, along with other factors. As with the macroeconomic variables, the forecast uncertainty surrounding the appropriate path of the federal funds rate is substantial. Page 12 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Forecast Uncertainty The economic projections provided by the members of the Board of Governors and the presi- dents of the Federal Reserve Banks inform discus- sions of monetary policy among policymakers and can aid public understanding of the basis for policy actions. Considerable uncertainty attends these projections, however. The economic and statistical models and relationships used to help produce eco- nomic forecasts are necessarily imperfect descrip- tions of the real world, and the future path of the economy can be affected by myriad unforeseen de- velopments and events. Thus, in setting the stance of monetary policy, participants consider not only what appears to be the most likely economic out- come as embodied in their projections, but also the range of alternative possibilities, the likelihood of their occurring, and the potential costs to the econ- omy should they occur. Table 2 summarizes the average historical accu- racy of a range of forecasts, including those re- ported in past Monetary Policy Reports and those pre- pared by the Federal Reserve Board’s staff in ad- vance of meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee. The projection error ranges shown in the table illustrate the considerable uncertainty as- sociated with economic forecasts. For example, suppose a participant projects that real gross do- mestic product (GDP) and total consumer prices will rise steadily at annual rates of, respectively, 3 percent and 2 percent. If the uncertainty attend- ing those projections is similar to that experienced in the past and the risks around the projections are broadly balanced, the numbers reported in table 2 would imply a probability of about 70 percent that actual GDP would expand within a range of 1.9 to 4.1 percent in the current year, 1.3 to 4.7 percent in the second year, 1.2 to 4.8 percent in the third year, and 1.1 to 4.9 percent in the fourth year. The cor- responding 70 percent confidence intervals for overall inflation would be 1.2 to 2.8 percent in the current year, 1.0 to 3.0 percent in the second year, 0.9 to 3.1 percent in the third year, and 1.0 to 3.0 percent in the fourth year. Because current conditions may differ from those that prevailed, on average, over history, participants provide judgments as to whether the uncertainty at- tached to their projections of each economic variable is greater than, smaller than, or broadly similar to typ- ical levels of forecast uncertainty seen in the past 20 years, as presented in table 2. That is, participants judge whether each eco- nomic variable is more likely to be above or below their projections of the most likely outcome. These judgments about the uncertainty and the risks attend- ing each participant’s projections are distinct from the diversity of participants’ views about the most likely outcomes. Forecast uncertainty is concerned with the risks associated with a particular projection rather than with divergences across a number of different projections. As with real activity and inflation, the outlook for the future path of the federal funds rate is subject to considerable uncertainty. This uncer- tainty arises primarily because each participant’s as- sessment of the appropriate stance of monetary policy depends importantly on the evolution of real activity and inflation over time. If economic conditions evolve in an unexpected manner, then assessments of the appropriate setting of the federal funds rate would change from that point forward. The final line in ta- ble 2 shows the error ranges for forecasts of short- term interest rates. They suggest that the historical confidence intervals associated with projections of the federal funds rate are quite wide. It should be noted, however, that these confidence intervals are not strictly consistent with the projections for the fed- eral funds rate, as these projections are not forecasts of the most likely quarterly outcomes but rather are projections of participants’ individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy and are on an end-of- year basis. However, the forecast errors should pro- vide a sense of the uncertainty around the future path of the federal funds rate generated by the uncertainty about the macroeconomic variables as well as addi- tional adjustments to monetary policy that would be appropriate to offset the effects of shocks to the economy.

Fi- nancial conditions were little changed, on net, over the intermeeting period and remained accommodative. Market participants suggested that evolving expectations for U.S. fiscal policy as well as stronger-than-expected economic data and corporate earnings reports helped support equity prices. Later in the intermeeting period, however, rising COVID-19 cases in Europe and the United States weighed on the outlook, and equity prices reversed some of their earlier gains. Implied volatility in the equity market moved higher during the intermeeting period, reflecting uncertainties associated with the U.S. election and the future path of fiscal policy as well as concerns about the trajectory of COVID-19 cases. Market participants’ expectations for the path of the fed- eral funds rate were little changed over the intermeeting period. In the Open Market Desk’s Survey of Primary Dealers and Survey of Market Participants, respondents’ views on when the Committee will most likely start rais- ing the target range for the federal funds rate were cen- tered around 2024. Expectations for the economic con- ditions that will prevail when the FOMC first lifts the target range were little changed since the September sur- veys. Respondents to the Desk’s surveys generally expected the Federal Reserve’s purchases of Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) to con- tinue at the current pace through the end of 2021 and then to slow in subsequent years, although there was a wide range of views about purchase amounts for 2022 and 2023. Market participants appeared increasingly fo- cused on how the Committee’s communications on as- set purchases might evolve. They expected those com- munications to place a greater emphasis on fostering ac- commodative financial conditions, and many noted the possibility that at some point the Committee might con- vey additional guidance about the future path of asset purchases. Some market participants expected the Com- mittee to eventually lengthen the weighted average ma- turity of the Federal Reserve’s purchases of Treasury se- curities. Page 2 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ The manager turned next to a discussion of financial market functioning, open market operations, and condi- tions in short-term funding markets. Markets for Treas- ury securities and agency MBS continued to function smoothly, with bid-ask spreads and a range of other mar- ket functioning indicators remaining near pre-pandemic levels. Weekly operations continued for agency com- mercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS), with the Desk purchasing only modest amounts. Short-term dol- lar funding markets also continued to function smoothly over the period, and forward measures of funding rates were consistent with expectations for calm conditions over year-end. The Federal Reserve’s balance sheet increased modestly over the intermeeting period to $7.2 trillion, as growth in securities holdings was partially offset by a decline in U.S. dollar liquidity swaps outstanding. Outstanding balances for credit and liquidity facilities were little changed. The manager noted that market participants continued to view these facilities as important backstops that would support market functioning and the flow of credit should stresses reemerge. By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk’s domestic transactions over the intermeeting period. There were no intervention operations in foreign curren- cies for the System’s account during the intermeeting pe- riod. Discussion on Asset Purchases Participants discussed the FOMC’s asset purchases, in- cluding the role they are playing in supporting the Com- mittee’s maximum-employment and price-stability goals. In their discussions, participants focused on the objec- tives of these purchases; considerations for assessing the appropriate pace and composition of asset purchases over time; communications regarding the future path of asset purchases; and the potential effects of higher levels of reserves, associated with the ongoing expansion in Federal Reserve asset holdings, on banks’ balance sheets and money market rates. Participants agreed that this discussion would be helpful for future assessments of the appropriate structure of the Committee’s asset pur- chases. While participants judged that immediate adjust- ments to the pace and composition of asset purchases were not necessary, they recognized that circumstances could shift to warrant such adjustments. Accordingly, participants saw the ongoing careful consideration of potential next steps for enhancing the Committee’s guid- ance for its asset purchases as appropriate. The participants’ discussion was preceded by staff presentations. The staff reviewed some key considera- tions relevant for conducting asset purchases in the cur- rent environment. The staff judged that the Commit- tee’s forward guidance on the federal funds rate, the ex- pansion of the Federal Reserve’s securities holdings since March, and expectations for a further expansion all had contributed to a very low level of longer-term yields despite substantial Treasury debt issuance. The staff noted that financial market participants generally ex- pected the Committee to continue its net asset purchases at the current pace through next year and at a reduced pace in subsequent years. The staff discussed various changes the Committee could make to the structure of its purchases, including to their pace and composition as well as to the guidance the Committee has been provid- ing to the public about its future asset purchases. The staff discussed the structure of asset purchase programs of several foreign central banks and how they have evolved during the pandemic. Finally, the staff evaluated how higher levels of reserves associated with the ongo- ing expansion in the Federal Reserve’s asset holdings might influence banks’ balance sheets and money market rates and discussed the various tools that the Federal Re- serve has for managing money market rates in an envi- ronment with very high levels of reserves. In their discussion regarding the role of the Committee’s asset purchases, participants noted that these purchases have supported and sustained smooth market function- ing and helped foster accommodative financial condi- tions. With market functioning seen as having largely recovered, many participants indicated that the role of asset purchases had shifted more toward fostering ac- commodative financial conditions for households and businesses to support the Committee’s employment and inflation goals. Still, participants generally judged that asset purchases would continue to support smooth mar- ket functioning, and many judged that asset purchases helped provide insurance against risks that might reemerge in financial markets in an environment of high uncertainty. A few participants indicated that asset pur- chases could also help guard against undesirable upward pressure on longer-term rates that could arise, for exam- ple, from higher-than-expected Treasury debt issuance. Several participants noted the possibility that there may be limits to the amount of additional accommodation that could be provided through increases in the Federal Reserve’s asset holdings in light of the low level of longer-term yields, and they expressed concerns that a significant expansion in asset holdings could have unin- tended consequences. _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Minutes of the Meeting of November 4–5, 2020 Page 3 Participants commented on considerations related to the appropriate pace and composition of asset purchases. Participants generally saw the current pace and compo- sition as effective in fostering accommodative financial conditions. Participants noted that the Committee could provide more accommodation, if appropriate, by in- creasing the pace of purchases or by shifting its Treasury purchases to those with a longer maturity without in- creasing the size of its purchases. Alternatively, the Committee could provide more accommodation, if ap- propriate, by conducting purchases of the same pace and composition over a longer horizon. Pointing to the re- cently announced change in the Bank of Canada’s asset purchase program, several participants judged that the Committee could maintain its current degree of accom- modation by lengthening the maturity of the Commit- tee’s Treasury purchases while reducing the pace of pur- chases somewhat. In their view, such a change in the Committee’s purchase structure would have to be care- fully communicated to the public to avoid the misper- ception that the reduced pace of purchases represented a decline in the degree of accommodation. A few par- ticipants expressed concern that maintaining the current pace of agency MBS purchases could contribute to po- tential valuation pressures in housing markets. The September FOMC statement indicated that asset purchases will continue “over coming months,” and par- ticipants viewed this guidance for asset purchases as hav- ing served the Committee well so far. Most participants judged that the Committee should update this guidance at some point and implement qualitative outcome-based guidance that links the horizon over which the Commit- tee anticipates it would be conducting asset purchases to economic conditions. These participants indicated that updating the Committee’s guidance for asset purchases in this manner would help keep the market’s expectation for future asset purchases aligned with the Committee’s intentions. Some of these participants also saw such up- dated guidance as reinforcing the Committee’s commit- ment to fostering outcomes consistent with maximum employment and inflation that averages 2 percent over time. A few participants were hesitant to make changes in the near term to the guidance for asset purchases and pointed to considerable uncertainty about the economic outlook and the appropriate use of balance sheet policies given that uncertainty. Participants noted that it would be important for the Committee’s guidance for future asset purchases to be consistent with the Committee’s forward guidance for the federal funds rate so that the use of these tools would be well coordinated in terms of achieving the Commit- tee’s objectives. Most participants judged that the guid- ance for asset purchases should imply that increases in the Committee’s securities holdings would taper and cease sometime before the Committee would begin to raise the target range for the federal funds rate. A num- ber of participants highlighted the view that after net purchases cease there would likely be a period of time in which maturing assets would be reinvested to roughly maintain the size of the Federal Reserve’s securities holdings. Participants commented on how a higher level of re- serves associated with the expansion in the Federal Re- serve’s asset holdings might affect the banking sector and money markets. A few participants raised concerns about the possibility that much higher levels of reserves might create pressure on banks’ balance sheets, includ- ing on regulatory ratios, or could potentially put undue downward pressure on money market rates. Most par- ticipants judged that the Federal Reserve had effective tools to address these circumstances. Some participants noted that, if needed, the Federal Reserve could consider various steps to manage the levels of short-term interest rates and the quantity of reserves, such as adjusting ad- ministered rates, expanding the overnight reverse repur- chase agreement program, or implementing a maturity extension program. Staff Review of the Economic Situation The coronavirus pandemic and the measures undertaken to contain its spread continued to affect economic activity in the United States and abroad. The information available at the time of the November 4–5 meeting suggested that U.S. real gross domestic product (GDP) had rebounded at a rapid rate in the third quarter but remained well below its level at the start of the year. Labor market conditions improved further in September, although the pace of gains eased and employment continued to be well below its level at the beginning of the year. Consumer price inflation—as measured by the 12-month percentage change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE) through September—had returned to its year- earlier pace but remained noticeably below the rates that were posted in January and February. Total nonfarm payroll employment expanded strongly in September, but the gain was markedly below the even larger increases seen in previous months. Through Sep- tember, payroll employment had retraced only about half of the decline seen at the onset of the pandemic. Page 4 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ The unemployment rate moved down further to 7.9 per- cent in September. The unemployment rates for African Americans and Asians both decreased, but the unem- ployment rate for Hispanics was little changed, and each group’s rate remained well above the national average. In addition, the overall labor force participation rate de- clined, and the employment-to-population ratio rose only slightly. Initial claims for unemployment insurance continued to move lower, on net, through late October, and weekly estimates of private-sector payrolls con- structed by the Board’s staff using data provided by the payroll processor ADP suggested that employment gains from mid-September to mid-October remained solid. The employment cost index (ECI) for total hourly labor compensation in the private sector, which likely had been less influenced than other hourly compensation measures by the concentration of recent job losses among lower-wage workers, rose 2.4 percent over the 12 months ending in September. This gain was a little smaller than the index’s year-earlier 12-month change; in addition, the 3-month changes in the ECI in June and September were noticeably below the average pace seen over the period from 2017 through 2019. Total PCE price inflation was 1.4 percent over the 12 months ending in September and continued to be held down by relatively weak aggregate demand and the declines in consumer energy prices seen earlier in the year. Core PCE price inflation, which excludes changes in consumer energy prices and many consumer food prices, was 1.5 percent over the same period, while the trimmed mean measure of 12-month PCE price infla- tion constructed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas was 1.9 percent in September. On a monthly basis, in- flation was a little lower in September, largely reflecting slower goods price inflation. The latest readings on sur- vey-based measures of longer-run inflation expectations moved lower, though each remained within the range in which it has fluctuated in recent years; in October, the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers measure for the next 5 to 10 years fell back to the level that pre- vailed in early 2020, while in September the 3-year-ahead measure from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York retraced its August increase. Real PCE rose strongly in the third quarter, though the increase was not sufficient to return consumer spending to its pre-pandemic level. Real disposable personal in- come declined, reflecting a large reduction in govern- ment transfer payments. As a result, the personal saving rate moved sharply lower, though it was still elevated rel- ative to its 2019 average. The consumer sentiment measures from the Michigan survey and the Conference Board had moved higher, on net, since August; although both indexes stood above their April troughs, they re- mained well below their levels at the start of the year. Housing-sector activity advanced in the third quarter, with real residential investment and home sales both moving above their first-quarter levels. Activity in this sector was likely being supported by low interest rates, the sector’s ability to adjust business practices in re- sponse to social distancing, and pent-up demand follow- ing the widespread shutdowns earlier in the year. Business fixed investment expanded strongly, led by an outsized increase in third-quarter equipment spending. By contrast, spending on nonresidential structures con- tinued to move lower and was likely restrained by firms’ hesitation to commit to projects with lengthy times to completion and uncertain future returns as well as by the effect of lower oil prices on drilling investment. Growth in both total industrial production and manu- facturing output turned negative in September after hav- ing slowed markedly in August. Part of the softness in manufacturing production appeared to be attributable to pandemic-related delays in the motor vehicle industry’s model-year changeover, though subdued foreign de- mand and weaker demand from domestic energy pro- ducers were also likely acting to restrain factory output. As of September, manufacturing output had recovered roughly two-thirds of the drop seen earlier in the year. Total real government purchases declined in the third quarter. Federal nondefense purchases fell especially sharply, largely reflecting a step-down in lender pro- cessing fees associated with the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP). In addition, real purchases by state and local governments declined further. The nominal U.S. international trade deficit narrowed in September after widening in August. Both exports and imports continued to rebound from their collapse in the first half of the year. Goods imports fully recovered to their January level, with broad-based increases in August and September. In contrast, goods exports by Septem- ber recovered only two-thirds of their decline since Jan- uary despite brisk growth in exports of agricultural prod- ucts and industrial supplies. Services trade remained de- pressed, driven by the continued suspension of most in- ternational travel. Altogether, net exports made a sub- stantial negative contribution to real GDP growth in the third quarter. Economic activity abroad rebounded sharply in the third quarter following a rollback of pandemic-related re- strictions. GDP levels, however, generally remained well _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Minutes of the Meeting of November 4–5, 2020 Page 5 below their pre-pandemic peaks, with China being a no- table exception. Domestic demand supported the re- covery, and in Asia there was also a strong rebound of exports, especially of electronics and, more recently, au- tos. Third-quarter growth was particularly rapid in those economies that experienced some of the deepest con- tractions in the second quarter, including France, Italy, and Spain among the advanced foreign economies (AFEs) and Mexico among the emerging market econo- mies. After falling through the end of the summer in many countries, inflation rates started to rise over the past two months but remained well below rates from early in the year. The rapid increase over recent weeks of new COVID-19 cases in several AFEs, especially in Europe, prompted governments to reintroduce restrictions to rein in this renewed wave of infections. In late October, the gov- ernments of several European countries—including England, France, and Germany—announced new na- tionwide restrictions (including the closures of bars and restaurants) and, in some cases, restrictions to the mo- bility of individuals within and across regions. Still, rel- ative to the spring, restrictions were noticeably less se- vere; factories, most businesses, and schools generally remained open. Staff Review of the Financial Situation Financial market sentiment was little changed over the intermeeting period against the backdrop of evolving U.S. election and fiscal outlooks, as well as rising COVID-19 cases in the United States and Europe. On net, the Treasury yield curve steepened modestly, corpo- rate bond spreads narrowed somewhat, and broad equity price indexes increased. Inflation compensation in- creased a little further, remaining close to pre-pandemic levels. Financing conditions for businesses with access to capital markets and households with high credit scores remained generally accommodative, although conditions remained tight or tightened somewhat for other borrowers. Yields on two-year nominal Treasury securities were lit- tle changed over the intermeeting period, while longer- term yields increased modestly, on net, reportedly re- flecting market participants’ reassessments of the elec- tion outcome and the outlook for fiscal policy. FOMC communications and macroeconomic data releases did not elicit material yield reactions. Measures of inflation compensation based on Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) edged up, on net, remaining close to their pre-pandemic levels. This development reflected in part the recovery of TIPS market liquidity conditions from their stressed levels in the spring. However, both the 5-year and 5-to-10-year measures of inflation com- pensation remained near the lower ends of their histori- cal ranges. The expected path for the federal funds rate over the next few years, as implied by a straight read of overnight index swap quotes, was little changed, on net, since the September FOMC meeting and remained close to the effective lower bound (ELB) until the end of 2023. Sur- vey-based expectations favored the first increase in the federal funds rate to occur in 2024. Broad stock price indexes increased, on balance, over the intermeeting period amid volatility associated with market participants’ reactions to news on the U.S. elec- tion, the pandemic’s trajectory, and the fiscal policy out- look. One-month option-implied volatility on the S&P 500—the VIX—increased some, on net, after briefly ris- ing sharply late in the intermeeting period. Spreads on corporate bond yields over comparable-maturity Treas- ury yields narrowed across the credit spectrum and stood somewhat below their historical median levels at the end of the intermeeting period. Conditions in short-term funding markets remained sta- ble over the intermeeting period. Spreads on commer- cial paper (CP) and negotiable certificates of deposit across different tenors were little changed and remained at pre-pandemic levels. The outstanding level of nonfi- nancial CP continued to move down over the intermeet- ing period, reportedly driven by issuers’ relatively low appetite for CP funding in light of the availability of longer-term financing on attractive terms. September quarter-end effects were muted, and there was no credit outstanding through the Commercial Paper Funding Fa- cility by the end of the intermeeting period. Conditions in money market funds (MMFs) were also generally calm over the intermeeting period, and net yields of MMFs remained stable near historical lows. The effective federal funds rate stood at 9 basis points, unchanged from the average over the previous inter- meeting period. The Secured Overnight Financing Rate averaged 8 basis points, edging down from the previous intermeeting period amid a modest net decrease in Treasury bill issuance. The amount of Federal Reserve repurchase agreements outstanding remained at zero over the intermeeting period, as dealers were able to ob- tain more attractive rates in the private market. The Fed- eral Reserve increased holdings of Treasury securities and agency MBS at the same pace as over the previous intermeeting period. Page 6 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Investor sentiment abroad turned negative over the in- termeeting period amid rising COVID-19 case counts, newly adopted restrictions aimed at containing the spread of the virus, and indicators pointing to a slowing recovery in several foreign economies, particularly in the euro area. Uncertainty about additional U.S. fiscal stim- ulus and the outcome of the U.S. presidential election also caused some asset price volatility abroad. On net, most foreign equity indexes declined, option-implied volatility in the euro area increased a bit, and most AFE long-term sovereign yields fell. Overall, the broad dollar index was little changed over the intermeeting period. The dollar appreciated mod- estly against most AFE currencies except the Japanese yen and the British pound. Several Asian currencies, in- cluding the Chinese renminbi, the South Korean won, and the Taiwanese dollar, appreciated against the U.S. dollar amid improving growth prospects and low COVID-19 case counts. Most Latin American curren- cies (especially the Brazilian real) and the Turkish lira de- preciated against the U.S. dollar on concerns about fiscal and political prospects in Latin America and Turkey. Financing conditions in capital markets continued to be broadly accommodative over the intermeeting period, supported by low interest rates and high equity valua- tions. With historically low corporate bond yields, gross issuance of both investment- and speculative-grade cor- porate bonds remained solid in September, moderating from robust readings in August but staying close to the averages seen in recent years. Most of this issuance was reportedly intended to refinance existing debt. Gross in- stitutional leveraged loan issuance continued to pick up in September but remained below its average pace in 2019. Collateralized loan obligation issuance was strong in September, likely supporting robust investor demand for newly issued leveraged loans in the coming months. The credit quality of nonfinancial corporations contin- ued to show signs of stabilization. The volume of down- grades to corporate bonds and leveraged loans fell to pre-pandemic levels through September. Corporate bond and leveraged loan defaults were low in August and September relative to their elevated readings in July. Market indicators of expected corporate bond and lev- eraged loan defaults remained somewhat elevated at above pre-pandemic levels, especially for lower-rated leveraged loan issuers. Commercial and industrial (C&I) loans on banks’ bal- ance sheets continued to decline through September, re- flecting a mix of weak origination activity and the repay- ment of credit-line draws from earlier in the year. In the October Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices (SLOOS), banks reported that stand- ards for C&I loans continued to tighten during the third quarter, although fewer banks reported tightening than in previous quarters. In addition, demand for C&I loans reportedly weakened in the third quarter. Financing conditions for small businesses remained tight as a result of the pandemic. Small business loan origina- tions dropped off sharply in August after a temporary boost from PPP distributions over the summer. At the same time, small businesses’ liquidity needs were high and appeared likely to increase further, with the most re- cent Census Bureau Small Business Pulse Survey point- ing to a majority of small businesses having no more than two months of cash on hand and many small busi- nesses anticipating some need for additional financial as- sistance in the next six months. However, the uncer- tainty surrounding earning prospects was reportedly making many business owners less willing to take on debt at prevailing terms. Small business loan perfor- mance generally deteriorated further over the intermeet- ing period. For commercial real estate (CRE) financed through cap- ital markets, financing conditions remained accommo- dative over the intermeeting period. Spreads on agency CMBS were narrow, and issuance was very strong in September. Spreads on triple-A non-agency CMBS, which were already within their pre-pandemic range in August, moved down further in September and early October, while non-agency issuance remained relatively subdued in September. In contrast, CRE loan growth at banks decelerated in the third quarter, while standards for CRE loans tightened further, according to the Octo- ber SLOOS. Financing conditions in the residential mortgage market were little changed over the intermeeting period. Mort- gage rates remained near historical lows, supporting high volumes of both home-purchase and refinancing origi- nations. Credit continued to flow to higher-score bor- rowers meeting standard conforming loan criteria, while it remained tight for borrowers with lower credit scores and for nonstandard mortgage products. Residential real estate loans on banks’ balance sheets declined, and the October SLOOS suggested that lending standards tightened for all mortgage types. Mortgage forbearance rates continued their downward trend, and the rate of new delinquencies remained low. In consumer credit markets, conditions remained ac- commodative for borrowers with relatively strong credit _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Minutes of the Meeting of November 4–5, 2020 Page 7 scores but continued to be tight for borrowers with sub- prime credit scores. Banks in the October SLOOS indi- cated that standards tightened and demand was little changed, on balance, across consumer loan types follow- ing a sharp contraction in demand in the second quarter. Credit card balances continued to decline through the third quarter, with gains in balances for account holders with prime credit scores offset by declines in those for nonprime accounts. Interest rates on existing accounts were little changed and remained below pre-crisis levels, while interest rates on new accounts to nonprime bor- rowers remained elevated. Auto loan balances increased solidly for prime and near-prime borrowers but declined for subprime borrowers. Auto loan interest rates in- creased but stayed below pre-pandemic levels. Condi- tions in the asset-backed securities market remained sta- ble over the intermeeting period. The staff provided an update on its assessment of the stability of the financial system. The staff judged that, accounting for low interest rates, asset valuations ap- peared moderate, with measures of compensation for risk generally in the middle of their historical ranges. However, uncertainty regarding the pandemic and eco- nomic outlook has been high, and the risk of sizable de- clines in asset prices, should adverse shocks materialize, has remained significant. CRE prices had started to de- cline in some sectors, while market conditions, including rising vacancies and declining rents, pointed to a risk of further drops, especially in severely affected sectors. The staff assessed vulnerabilities associated with house- hold and business borrowing as notable. Household fi- nances had weakened with the economic downturn, and some households could find debt levels burdensome go- ing forward. Business debt levels were high before the pandemic, and the ability of some businesses to service these obligations will depend on the course of the eco- nomic recovery. The staff assessed vulnerabilities aris- ing from financial leverage as moderate. While the bank- ing sector has been resilient to recent developments, banks’ profitability, as well as that of a range of financial institutions, could be affected by future losses, the weak- ening of the economic outlook relative to pre-pandemic conditions, and low interest rates. With regard to fund- ing risks, the staff highlighted that structural vulnerabili- ties in markets for short-term funding and corporate bonds remained present. Emergency facilities were viewed as critical in restoring market functioning and continued to serve as important backstops. The staff also summarized near-term risks to financial stability identified in outreach to the public in recent months, in- cluding concerns associated with the outlook for the pandemic and business defaults. Staff Economic Outlook In the U.S. economic projection prepared by the staff for the November FOMC meeting, the rate of real GDP growth and the pace of declines in the unemployment rate over the second half of this year were similar to those in the September forecast despite material revisions to several assumptions influencing the outlook along with incoming data that were, on balance, better than expected. In particular, in the absence of clear progress toward an agreement on further fiscal stimulus, the staff removed the assumption that an additional tranche of fiscal policy support would be enacted. Although this lack of additional fiscal support was expected to cause significant hardships for a number of households, the staff now assessed that the savings cushion accumulated by other households would be enough to allow total consumption to be largely maintained through year-end. Hence, as in the September projection, the staff continued to expect a rapid but partial rebound in activity over the second half of the year following the unprecedented contraction in the spring. The inflation forecast for the rest of the year was revised up slightly in response to incoming readings on inflation that were, on balance, higher than expected. Nevertheless, inflation was still projected to finish the year at a relatively subdued level, reflecting substantial margins of slack in labor and product markets and the large declines in consumer energy prices seen earlier in the year. In the staff’s medium-term projection, the assumption that significant additional fiscal support would not be enacted pointed to a lower trajectory for aggregate demand going forward. However, recent data on tax receipts also suggested that the fiscal positions of states and localities had deteriorated less than expected, which led the staff to boost the projected path of state and local government purchases. Hence, with monetary policy assumed to remain highly accommodative and social-distancing measures expected to ease further, the staff continued to project that real GDP over the medium term would outpace potential, leading to a considerable further decline in the unemployment rate. The resulting take-up of economic slack was in turn expected to cause inflation to increase gradually, and the inflation rate was projected to moderately overshoot 2 percent for some time in the years beyond 2023 as monetary policy remained accommodative. Page 8 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ The staff continued to observe that the uncertainty related to the future course of the pandemic and its consequences for the economy was high. The staff also continued to view the risks to the economic outlook as tilted to the downside, with the latest data suggesting an increased probability of a resurgence in the disease. Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook Participants noted that the COVID-19 pandemic was causing tremendous human and economic hardship across the United States and around the world. Eco- nomic activity and employment had continued to re- cover but remained well below their levels at the begin- ning of the year. Weaker demand and earlier declines in oil prices had been holding down consumer price infla- tion. Overall financial conditions remained accommo- dative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses. Participants agreed that the path of the economy would depend on the course of the virus and that the ongoing public health crisis would continue to weigh on economic activity, employment, and inflation in the near term and posed considerable risks to the economy’s medium-term outlook. Participants observed that the economy had registered a rapid though incomplete rebound, with third-quarter real GDP rising at an annual rate of 33 percent, reflect- ing gains across consumer spending, housing-sector ac- tivity, and business equipment investment. In recent months, however, the pace of improvement had moder- ated, with slower growth expected for the fourth quarter. Participants noted that economic activity thus far had re- covered faster than had been expected earlier in the year. Household spending on goods, especially durable goods, had been strong and had moved above its pre-pandemic level. Participants commented that the rebound in con- sumer spending was due in part to federal stimulus pay- ments and expanded unemployment benefits, which provided essential support to many households. Partic- ipants viewed accommodative monetary policy as also contributing to gains in durable goods and residential in- vestment as well as the surge in home sales. In contrast, participants noted that consumer outlays for services were increasing more slowly than for durable goods, par- ticularly for items such as air travel, hotel accommoda- tions, and restaurant meals, which had been significantly disrupted by voluntary and mandated social-distancing measures. Participants generally expected the strength in household spending to continue, especially for dura- ble goods and residential investment. A few participants noted that households’ balance sheets generally ap- peared healthy and an unwinding of the large pool of household savings accumulated during the pandemic could provide greater-than-anticipated momentum to consumer spending over coming months. However, several participants expressed concern that, in the ab- sence of additional fiscal support, lower- and moderate- income households might need to reduce their spending sharply when their savings were exhausted. A couple of these participants noted reports from their banking con- tacts that households appeared to be rapidly exhausting funds they received from fiscal relief programs. Participants noted that business equipment investment had also picked up. A few participants expected the mo- mentum in investment to extend into next year as the economic recovery continued, while a couple of other participants noted that many businesses in their Districts were deferring longer-term commitments because of heighted uncertainty about the economic outlook. The recovery was viewed as unevenly distributed across in- dustries. While many business contacts, particularly those in the durable goods or housing industries, re- ported progress in adapting to the pandemic or im- proved business conditions, others—especially those with ties to small businesses and the hospitality, aviation, and nonresidential construction industries—were still seeing very difficult circumstances. Contacts reported improved conditions in the agricultural sector, boosted by strong demand from China as well as domestic etha- nol production, higher crop prices, and federal aid pay- ments. Looking ahead, some business contacts ex- pressed concerns that many households and businesses were currently in a weaker position to weather additional economic shocks than they had been at the beginning of the pandemic. Participants observed that labor market conditions had continued to improve in recent months, with roughly half of the 22 million jobs lost over March and April having been regained. The unemployment rate had de- clined further, and the employment gains since the spring were generally seen as larger than anticipated. Business contacts in a couple of Districts—particularly those in the manufacturing, health-care, and technology sectors—reported having trouble hiring workers for rea- sons likely related to virus cases or workers’ need to pro- vide childcare. Several participants noted that the de- cline in the unemployment rate in recent months had been accompanied by a fall in the labor force participa- tion rate, particularly among those with a high school education or lower and among women. Although the number of workers on temporary layoff had fallen _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Minutes of the Meeting of November 4–5, 2020 Page 9 sharply, the number of permanent job losers had contin- ued to rise. Most participants commented that the pace of labor market improvement was likely to moderate go- ing forward. A couple of them noted that many busi- nesses in industries severely affected by the pandemic were downsizing or that some businesses were focused on cutting costs or increasing productivity, including through automation. Many participants observed that high rates of job losses had been especially prevalent among lower-wage workers, particularly in the services sector, and among women, African Americans, and His- panics. A few participants noted that these trends, if slow to reverse, could exacerbate racial, gender, and other social-economic disparities. In addition, a slow job market recovery would cause particular hardship for those with less educational attainment, less access to childcare or broadband, or greater need for retraining. In their comments about inflation, participants noted that some consumer prices had increased more quickly than expected in recent months but that broader price trends were still quite soft. The upturn in consumer price inflation was primarily attributed to price increases in sectors where the pandemic had induced stronger de- mand, such as consumer durables. In contrast, services price inflation remained softer than pre-pandemic rates, as prices for the categories most affected by social dis- tancing, such as accommodations and airfares, contin- ued to be very depressed and housing services inflation moderated. Several participants commented on the un- usually large relative price movements caused by the pandemic and the considerable uncertainty as to how long these price changes would persist. Participants noted that financial conditions were gener- ally accommodative and that actions by the Federal Re- serve, including the establishment of emergency lending facilities with the approval of and, in some cases, provi- sion of equity investments by the Treasury, were sup- porting the flow of credit to households, businesses, and communities. While these actions were viewed as con- tributing to accommodative financial conditions, partic- ipants noted important differences in credit availability across borrowers. In particular, financing conditions eased further for residential mortgage borrowers and for large corporations that were able to access capital mar- kets, but surveys of credit availability indicated that bank lending conditions tightened further. A few participants noted that the financing conditions for small businesses were especially worrisome, as the PPP had ended and the prospect for additional fiscal support remained un- certain. They pointed to the most recent Census Bureau Small Business Pulse Survey, in which more than half of the respondents reported having no more than two months of cash on hand. Participants continued to see the uncertainty surround- ing the economic outlook as quite elevated, with the path of the economy highly dependent on the course of the virus; on how individuals, businesses, and public officials responded to it; and on the effectiveness of public health measures to address it. Participants cited several down- side risks that could threaten the recovery. While an- other broad economic shutdown was seen as unlikely, participants remained concerned about the possibility of a further resurgence of the virus that could undermine the recovery. The majority of participants also saw the risk that current and expected fiscal support for house- holds, businesses, and state and local governments might not be sufficient to sustain activity levels in those sectors, while a few participants noted that additional fiscal stim- ulus that was larger than anticipated could be an upside risk. Some participants commented that the recent surge in virus cases in Europe and the reimposition of re- strictions there could lead to a slowdown in economic activity in the euro area and have negative spillover ef- fects on the U.S. recovery. Some participants raised con- cerns regarding the longer-run effects of the pandemic, including sectoral restructurings that could slow employ- ment growth or an acceleration of technological disrup- tions that could be limiting the pricing power of some firms. A number of participants commented on various poten- tial risks to financial stability. A few participants noted that the banking system showed considerable resilience through the end of the third quarter, and a few observed that this resilience partly reflected stronger-than-ex- pected balance sheets of their customers, with delin- quency rates declining or showing only moderate in- creases. Moreover, capital positions and loan loss re- serves for large banks were higher than before the pan- demic. Several participants emphasized the need to en- sure that banks continue to maintain strong capital lev- els, as lower levels of capital are typically associated with tighter credit availability from banks. Several partici- pants commented on the vulnerabilities witnessed dur- ing the March selloff in the Treasury market. The sub- stantial maturity and liquidity transformations under- taken by some nonbank financial institutions—such as prime MMFs and corporate bond and bank loan mutual funds—were also discussed. A couple of participants expressed concerns that a prolonged period of low in- terest rates and highly accommodative financial market conditions could lead to excessive risk-taking, which in Page 10 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ turn could result in elevated firm bankruptcies and sig- nificant employment losses in the next economic down- turn. A few participants noted that climate change poses important challenges to financial stability and welcomed analysis of climate change as both a source of shocks and an underlying vulnerability. A couple of participants commented that the actions taken by the Federal Re- serve to support the economy and achieve its mandated goals also supported financial stability. Relatedly, several participants emphasized the important roles various sec- tion 13(3) facilities played in restoring financial market confidence and supporting financial stability; they noted that these facilities were still serving as an important backstop in financial markets. A few participants noted that it was important to extend them beyond year-end. In their consideration of monetary policy at this meeting, participants reaffirmed the Federal Reserve’s commit- ment to using its full range of tools in order to support the U.S. economy during this challenging time, thereby promoting the Committee’s statutory goals of maximum employment and price stability. Participants agreed that the path of the economy would depend significantly on the course of the virus and that the ongoing public health crisis would continue to weigh on economic ac- tivity, employment, and inflation in the near term and posed considerable risks to the economic outlook over the medium term. In light of this assessment, all partic- ipants judged that maintaining an accommodative stance of monetary policy was essential to foster economic re- covery and to achieve the Committee’s long-run 2 per- cent inflation objective. Participants remarked that the Committee’s action in September to provide more explicit outcome-based for- ward guidance for the federal funds rate had been an im- portant step to affirm the Committee’s strong commit- ment to the goals and strategy articulated in its revised Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy. Several participants noted that they were en- couraged by evidence that suggested that market partic- ipants’ expectations of the economic conditions that would likely prevail at the time of liftoff seemed broadly consistent with the Committee’s forward guidance and revised consensus statement. Participants agreed that monetary policy was providing substantial accommodation, and most concurred that, with the federal funds rate at the ELB, much of that ac- commodation was due to the Committee’s forward guid- ance and increases in securities holdings. They judged that the current stance of monetary policy remained ap- propriate, as both employment and inflation remained well short of the Committee’s goals and the uncertainty about the course of the virus and the outlook for the economy continued to be very elevated. Participants viewed the resurgence of COVID-19 cases in the United States and abroad as a downside risk to the recovery; a few participants noted that diminished odds for further significant fiscal support also increased downside risks and added to uncertainty about the economic outlook. Regarding asset purchases, participants judged that it would be appropriate over coming months for the Fed- eral Reserve to increase its holdings of Treasury securi- ties and agency MBS at least at the current pace. These actions would continue to help sustain smooth market functioning and help foster accommodative financial conditions, thereby supporting the flow of credit to households and businesses. Many participants judged that the Committee might want to enhance its guidance for asset purchases fairly soon. Most participants fa- vored moving to qualitative outcome-based guidance for asset purchases that links the horizon over which the Committee anticipates it would be conducting asset pur- chases to economic conditions. A few participants were hesitant to make changes in the near term to the guid- ance for asset purchases and pointed to considerable un- certainty about the economic outlook and the appropri- ate use of balance sheet policies given that uncertainty. Discussion on Recommended Changes to the Sum- mary of Economic Projections Participants considered two recommendations from the subcommittee on communications for changes to the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) that would enhance the information provided to the public. These recommendations included accelerating the release of the full set of SEP exhibits from three weeks after the corresponding FOMC meeting, when the minutes of that meeting are released, to the day of the policy deci- sion and adding new charts that display a time series of diffusion indexes for participants’ judgments of uncer- tainty and risks. With these recommendations, the writ- ten summary of the projections that has been included as an addendum to the minutes of the corresponding FOMC meeting would be discontinued. Most of the participants who commented noted that re- leasing all SEP materials at the time of the postmeeting statement would provide greater context for the policy decision, highlight the risk-management factors relevant for the decision, or further emphasize the degree of un- certainty around participants’ modal projections. Some who commented noted that the SEP serves a valuable role in illustrating how participants’ policy assessments _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Minutes of the Meeting of November 4–5, 2020 Page 11 respond to changes in the economic outlook. Most par- ticipants who commented suggested that it would be useful to continue thinking about options for refining the SEP. Participants unanimously supported the rec- ommended changes and agreed that they should be im- plemented beginning in December. Committee Policy Action In their discussion of monetary policy for this meeting, members agreed that the COVID-19 pandemic was causing tremendous human and economic hardship across the United States and around the world. They noted that economic activity and employment had con- tinued to recover but remained well below their levels at the beginning of the year, and that weaker demand and earlier declines in oil prices had been holding down con- sumer price inflation. Overall financial conditions re- mained accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses. Members agreed that the Federal Reserve was committed to using its full range of tools to support the U.S. economy in this chal- lenging time, thereby promoting its maximum-employ- ment and price-stability goals. Members also stated that the path of the economy would depend significantly on the course of the virus. In addition, members agreed that the ongoing public health crisis would continue to weigh on economic activity, employment, and inflation in the near term and was posing considerable risks to the economic outlook over the medium term. All members reaffirmed that, in accordance with the Committee’s goals to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run and with inflation running persistently below this longer- run goal, they would aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and longer-term inflation expecta- tions remain well anchored at 2 percent. Members ex- pected to maintain an accommodative stance of mone- tary policy until those outcomes were achieved. All members agreed to maintain the target range for the fed- eral funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent, and they expected that it would be appropriate to maintain this target range un- til labor market conditions had reached levels consistent with the Committee’s assessments of maximum employ- ment and inflation had risen to 2 percent and was on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time. In addition, members agreed that over coming months it would be appropriate for the Federal Reserve to increase its holdings of Treasury securities and agency MBS at least at the current pace to sustain smooth market func- tioning and help foster accommodative financial condi- tions, thereby supporting the flow of credit to house- holds and businesses. Members agreed that, in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, they would continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and that they would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate in the event that risks emerged that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals. Members also agreed that, in as- sessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, they would take into account a wide range of information, in- cluding readings on public health, labor market condi- tions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the fol- lowing domestic policy directive, for release at 2:00 p.m.: “Effective November 6, 2020, the Federal Open Market Committee directs the Desk to:  Undertake open market operations as nec- essary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of 0 to ¼ percent.  Increase the System Open Market Ac- count holdings of Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) at the current pace. Increase holdings of Treasury securities and agency MBS by ad- ditional amounts and purchase agency commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) as needed to sustain smooth func- tioning of markets for these securities.  Conduct term and overnight repurchase agreement operations to support effective policy implementation and the smooth functioning of short-term U.S. dollar funding markets.  Conduct overnight reverse repurchase agreement operations at an offering rate of 0.00 percent and with a per-counterparty limit of $30 billion per day; the per-coun- terparty limit can be temporarily increased at the discretion of the Chair.  Roll over at auction all principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of Treasury securities and reinvest all princi- pal payments from the Federal Reserve’s Page 12 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ holdings of agency debt and agency MBS in agency MBS.  Allow modest deviations from stated amounts for purchases and reinvestments, if needed for operational reasons.  Engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate set- tlement of the Federal Reserve’s agency MBS transactions.” The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below for release at 2:00 p.m.: “The Federal Reserve is committed to using its full range of tools to support the U.S. economy in this challenging time, thereby promoting its maximum employment and price stability goals. The COVID-19 pandemic is causing tremen- dous human and economic hardship across the United States and around the world.

The Committee seeks to achieve maximum em- ployment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. With inflation running per- sistently below this longer-run goal, the Com- mittee will aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent.

Powell, John C. Williams, Michelle W. Bowman, Lael Brainard, Richard H. Clarida, Mary C. Daly, Patrick Harker, Robert S. Kaplan, Loretta J. Mester, and Randal K. Quarles. Voting against this action: None. Ms. Daly voted as alternate member at this meeting. Consistent with the Committee’s decision to leave the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged, the Board of Governors voted unanimously to leave the in- terest rates on required and excess reserve balances at 0.10 percent. The Board of Governors also voted unan- imously to approve establishment of the primary credit rate at the existing level of 0.25 percent, effective No- vember 6, 2020. It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Tuesday–Wednesday, December 15– 16, 2020. The meeting adjourned at 10:05 a.m. on No- vember 5, 2020.

Market sentiment improved over the pe- riod, as reduced uncertainty related to the U.S. election and positive vaccine news outweighed the anticipated ef- fect of the ongoing surge in the pandemic. U.S. equity price indexes reached all-time highs, with the largest gains registered in sectors that have underperformed during the pandemic. Corporate credit spreads tight- ened, most notably among lower-rated firms and in sec- tors most affected by social distancing measures result- ing from the pandemic. Longer-term Treasury yields rose modestly, driven by increases in inflation compen- sation. The positive vaccine news also supported risk sentiment abroad, leading many global equity price in- dexes to advance and the U.S. dollar to depreciate fur- ther. Market participants had highlighted that uncertainty nevertheless remained high and had pointed to several prominent risks to the economic outlook. These risks included the possibility that the vaccine rollout might not proceed as smoothly as anticipated, the potential for adverse developments in negotiations concerning the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Un- ion, and the potential for deterioration in already strained sectors, such as those involving small businesses and certain segments of commercial real estate (CRE). With regard to market expectations concerning the pol- icy outlook, responses to the Open Market Desk surveys of dealers and market participants suggested that views on the most likely timing of the next increase in the tar- get range for the federal funds rate coalesced further around the first half of 2024. Survey responses contin- ued to indicate median expectations of headline personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation above 2 per- cent and an unemployment rate of around 4 percent at Page 2 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ the time of the first increase in the target range for the federal funds rate. A majority of Desk survey respond- ents indicated that they expected the Committee to re- vise its guidance on asset purchases at the current meet- ing, with many noting that they anticipated the an- nouncement of some form of qualitative, outcome- based guidance tied to inflation, the unemployment rate, or both. Median Desk survey responses continued to suggest expectations that purchases would begin to slow in the first half of 2022 and cease altogether in 2023. The size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet increased to around $7.3 trillion over the intermeeting period, driven by growth in securities holdings. The Desk con- ducted purchases to increase holdings of Treasury secu- rities and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) at the minimum pace directed by the FOMC, as markets for these securities continued to function smoothly. News that CARES Act (Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act) funding would not be available to support new activity in section 13(3) facilities after the end of the year had only a modest effect on financial markets. New activity remained limited across most Federal Reserve funding operations and section 13(3) fa- cilities, although the Municipal Liquidity Facility and the Main Street Lending Program saw growing usage over the period, with more take-up expected before their scheduled year-end termination. The manager discussed a proposal to extend the tempo- rary U.S. dollar liquidity swap arrangements as well as the temporary FIMA (Foreign and International Mone- tary Authorities) Repo Facility through September 2021. The path to a complete economic recovery remained un- certain across the globe, particularly for many emerging market countries, underscoring the need for backstops that could address potential market stresses and prevent spillovers from reemerging. Keeping these arrange- ments in place would contribute to sustaining improve- ments in global dollar funding markets and to the con- tinued smooth functioning of the U.S. Treasury securi- ties market. Under the proposal, provided that the Com- mittee had no objections, the Chair would approve the extension of the temporary liquidity swap lines following the meeting. The extensions of the swap and FIMA re- purchase agreement (repo) arrangements would be an- nounced following this meeting. Market participants generally anticipated calm money market conditions through year-end, and the premiums 5 The approved FIMA Desk Resolution, which updates the July 2020 resolution with a new expiration date, is available along with other Committee organizational documents at paid for dollar funding crossing year-end generally were below those observed in recent years. Money market fu- tures also indicated expectations of short-term rates moving down modestly in coming months, in light of anticipated further increases in aggregate reserve bal- ances and a moderation in Treasury bill supply. The manager anticipated that administered rates and the overnight reverse repo program would be effective tools for maintaining control of overnight money market rates. By unanimous vote, the Committee voted to approve a resolution that extended through September 30, 2021, the expiration of a temporary repo facility for foreign and international monetary authorities (FIMA Repo Fa- cility).5 Secretary’s note: The Chair subsequently pro- vided approval to the Desk, following the pro- cedures in the Authorization for Foreign Cur- rency Operations, to extend the expiration of the temporary U.S. dollar liquidity swap lines through September 30, 2021. By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk’s domestic transactions over the intermeeting period. There were no intervention operations in foreign curren- cies for the System’s account during the intermeeting pe- riod. Staff Review of the Economic Situation The COVID-19 pandemic and the measures undertaken to contain its spread continued to affect economic activ- ity in the United States and abroad. The information available at the time of the December 15–16 meeting suggested that U.S. real gross domestic product (GDP) was continuing to recover in the fourth quarter, but at a more moderate pace than its rapid third-quarter rate, and that the level of real GDP remained well below its level at the start of 2020. Labor market conditions improved further over October and November, although employ- ment continued to be well below its level at the begin- ning of the year. Consumer price inflation through Oc- tober—as measured by the 12-month percentage change in the PCE price index—remained notably below the rates seen in early 2020. Total nonfarm payroll employment continued to in- crease solidly over October and November, though the rate of monthly job gains was more moderate than the substantial third-quarter pace. Through November, https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/rules_au- thorizations.htm. Minutes of the Meeting of December 15–16, 2020 Page 3 _____________________________________________________________________________________________ payroll employment had regained somewhat more than half of the losses seen at the onset of the pandemic. The unemployment rate moved down further and stood at 6.7 percent in November. The unemployment rates for African Americans and Hispanics each declined but re- mained well above the national average. Both the labor force participation rate and the employment-to- population ratio in November were above their levels of two months earlier. The four-week moving average of initial claims for unemployment insurance was only slightly lower in early December than it had been in late October. Weekly estimates of private-sector payrolls constructed by Federal Reserve Board staff using data provided by the payroll processor ADP suggested that the four-week average of private employment gains in early December was lower than it was in mid-November. Both the 12-month change in average hourly earnings for all employees through November and the four- quarter change in total labor compensation per hour in the business sector through the third quarter continued to be dominated by changes in the composition of the workforce. The substantial employment losses over the past year were most significant among lower-wage work- ers—a situation that had led to outsized increases in these average measures of earnings and compensation that were not indicative of tight labor market conditions. Total PCE price inflation was 1.2 percent over the 12 months ending in October, and it continued to be held down by relatively weak aggregate demand and the declines in consumer energy prices seen earlier in 2020. Core PCE price inflation, which excludes changes in consumer energy prices and many consumer food prices, was 1.4 percent over the same period, while the trimmed mean measure of 12-month PCE price infla- tion constructed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas was 1.7 percent in October. In November, the 12-month change in the consumer price index (CPI) was 1.2 percent, while core CPI inflation was 1.6 percent over the same period. The latest readings on survey- based measures of longer-run inflation expectations edged up, though each remained within the range in which it has fluctuated in recent years; in November and early December, the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers measure for the next 5 to 10 years was slightly above its level in October, while the 3-year-ahead measure produced by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York rose a bit in November. Real PCE rose strongly in October, though at a more moderate pace than in the third quarter. Real disposable personal income declined in October, reflecting a large reduction in government transfer payments, even though wage and salary income continued to climb. As a result, the personal saving rate moved lower, though it continued to be notably above its 2019 average. In No- vember, the components of the nominal retail sales data used to estimate PCE, along with the rate of light motor vehicle sales, stepped down, possibly reflecting the ef- fects on consumer spending of renewed social- distancing measures and concerns about the resurgent pandemic. Consumer sentiment, as measured by both the Michigan survey and the Conference Board, moved somewhat lower, on net, since October, although both indexes were still above their April troughs. Housing-sector activity advanced further, on balance, in October, supported in part by low interest rates. Starts and construction permits for single-family homes con- tinued to rise, while starts of multi-family units moved sideways. Sales of existing homes increased solidly, though new home sales were roughly flat. Business fixed investment appeared to be expanding fur- ther, on net, in the fourth quarter following an outsized third-quarter increase. Nominal shipments of nonde- fense capital goods excluding aircraft rose strongly in October, and new orders for these capital goods contin- ued to advance. By contrast, nominal spending on non- residential structures outside of the drilling and mining sector declined further in October. The number of crude oil and natural gas rigs in operation—an indicator of business spending on structures in the drilling and mining sector—continued to move up somewhat through early December, although the number of rigs in operation was still subdued, reflecting the effect of low oil prices on drilling investment. Industrial production rose strongly over October and November, led by gains in manufacturing output, but production was still below its February pre-pandemic level. The pickup in the production of motor vehicles and related parts was particularly strong in November. Output in the mining sector—which includes crude oil and natural gas drilling and extraction—increased, on net, over October and November. Total real government purchases appeared to be declin- ing moderately, on balance, in the fourth quarter. Fed- eral defense spending continued to rise in October and November, although federal employment declined with the layoff of temporary census workers. State and local government payrolls decreased in October and Novem- ber, and nominal state and local construction expendi- tures in October were somewhat below their third-quar- ter level. Page 4 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ The nominal U.S. international trade deficit widened in October. Both imports and exports continued to re- bound from their collapse in the first half of the year. Goods imports in October rose above their January level after several months of strong growth. Goods exports, however, had only recovered three-fourths of their de- cline since January despite brisk growth in agricultural exports. Services trade remained depressed, driven by the continued suspension of most international travel. After a strong rebound in the third quarter, foreign eco- nomic growth appeared to slow sharply in recent months. The resurgence of coronavirus infections in Europe and Canada prompted governments to reintro- duce social-distancing restrictions, leading to a fall in measures of mobility and services activity. Even so, with restrictions less severe and more targeted than in the spring, the hit to economic activity looked to be more limited. Economic growth appeared to hold up better in several emerging Asian economies. In these econo- mies, effective virus control was supporting domestic demand, while strong external demand boosted exports. Inflationary pressures remained subdued in most foreign economies amid substantial economic slack. Staff Review of the Financial Situation Financial market sentiment improved over the inter- meeting period, boosted by news of forthcoming COVID-19 vaccines and reduced uncertainty following the U.S. election that outweighed concerns regarding the continued rise in COVID-19 cases and the potential ef- fects of ensuing restrictions. Corporate bond spreads narrowed, and major global equity price indexes rose on net. The prospect of additional fiscal stimulus likely contributed to a steeper U.S. Treasury yield curve, in- creased inflation compensation, and broad dollar depre- ciation. Financing conditions for businesses able to ac- cess capital markets and households possessing high credit scores remained accommodative and eased a bit further in some sectors, but conditions for borrowers dependent on bank financing remained tight. Yields on 2-year nominal Treasury securities were little changed since the November FOMC meeting, while 10- and 30-year yields rose moderately. Market partici- pants attributed the increases in longer-term yields pri- marily to greater optimism about the economic outlook, due to the forthcoming availability of effective vaccines and renewed fiscal stimulus negotiations. Near-dated option-implied volatility on the 10-year Treasury futures contract declined to historic lows. The rise in longer- term Treasury yields was concentrated in inflation com- pensation. The 5-year and 5-to-10-year measures of in- flation compensation based on Treasury Inflation Pro- tected Securities rose above their pre-pandemic levels. The expected path of the federal funds rate, based on a straight read of overnight index swap rates, remained close to the effective lower bound through mid-2023. Survey-based measures indicated that market expecta- tions regarding the federal funds rate target range did not show a tightening until 2024. Broad stock price indexes increased over the intermeet- ing period, led by steep stock price gains in cyclical sec- tors and buoyed by the prospect of successful vaccines and lower post-election uncertainty. One-month S&P 500 option-implied volatility—the VIX—declined, re- versing a pre-election increase. Consistent with the op- timism driving stock prices, spreads of corporate bond yields over comparable-maturity Treasury yields nar- rowed markedly across the credit spectrum, most nota- bly for debt securities of the lowest credit quality firms. Conditions in short-term funding markets remained sta- ble over the intermeeting period. Spreads on commer- cial paper (CP) and negotiable certificates of deposit across different tenors were little changed, on net, and remained around pre-pandemic levels despite continued outflows from prime money market funds (MMFs) and the coming year-end. CP issuance was robust over the intermeeting period across the different tenors. With the yields of prime MMFs approaching those of government MMFs, assets under management (AUM) of prime MMFs declined moderately, while AUM of government MMFs were little changed. Net yields of prime and gov- ernment MMFs both remained near historically low lev- els. The intermeeting averages of the effective federal funds rate and the Secured Overnight Financing Rate remained unchanged from the previous intermeeting period aver- ages, at 9 basis points and 8 basis points, respectively. Term and forward repo market quotes indicated muted year-end funding pressure amid ample liquidity condi- tions. The Federal Reserve maintained its pace of pur- chases of Treasury securities and agency MBS, and Fed- eral Reserve repos outstanding remained at zero over the intermeeting period. Investor sentiment abroad improved over the intermeet- ing period, as favorable news on COVID-19 vaccines and the resolution of uncertainty regarding the U.S. elec- tion apparently outweighed concerns about another surge in COVID-19 cases and the resulting adoption of tighter social-distancing restrictions in many countries. Minutes of the Meeting of December 15–16, 2020 Page 5 _____________________________________________________________________________________________ On balance, prices of global risky assets increased nota- bly, implied volatility dropped sharply, and the dollar de- preciated against most currencies. Most advanced for- eign economy sovereign yields were little changed, on net, as policymakers in several countries announced ad- ditional actions aimed at maintaining accommodative fi- nancial conditions. Financing conditions in capital markets continued to be broadly accommodative, supported by low interest rates and high equity valuations. With historically low corpo- rate bond yields, gross issuance of both investment- and speculative-grade bonds remained solid in October. Much of the recent issuance was intended to refinance existing debt. Gross institutional leveraged loan issu- ance increased substantially in October for both new loans and refinancing. Seasoned equity offerings in Oc- tober and November were similar to the typical volumes observed in previous years, though equity raised through initial public offerings moderated somewhat from the robust rate of issuance in September. Commercial and industrial (C&I) loans outstanding on banks’ balance sheets contracted in October and November, reflecting the continued paydown of loan balances and the start of Paycheck Protection Program loan forgiveness activity. The credit quality of nonfinancial corporations contin- ued to show signs of stabilization. Although the volume of nonfinancial corporate bond downgrades outpaced upgrades somewhat in October and November, nonfi- nancial corporate bond defaults continued to decline. The rate of leveraged loan defaults was largely un- changed in October, albeit at somewhat elevated levels. Market indicators of future default expectations for cor- porate bonds fell slightly but remained above their pre- pandemic levels. In the municipal bond market, financ- ing conditions remained accommodative. Issuance of state and local government debt moderated in Novem- ber after all-time high issuance in October, and market- based measures of state credit quality were little changed on net. Financing conditions for small businesses remained tight, although some indicators suggested that they might have improved a bit. Data provided by the Fed- eral Reserve Small Business Lending Survey showed that standards for small businesses tightened, on net, over the third quarter, consistent with the most recent Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Prac- tices. Small business loan originations ticked up in Oc- tober to a level near that seen in the same period last year. Short-term delinquencies and defaults remained relatively elevated but significantly lower than the levels observed following the financial crisis. In light of the uncertain outlook, small business owners’ assessments of the risk of permanent closures remained elevated in most sectors, according to the Census Small Business Pulse Survey. In the CRE market, financing conditions remained ac- commodative, on net, over the intermeeting period. Agency commercial mortgage-backed security (CMBS) spreads remained narrow amid strong issuance in Octo- ber, while non-agency CMBS spreads ticked down. Triple-B-rated non-agency CMBS spreads came down substantially from their highs in the spring, although they remained elevated relative to pre-pandemic levels. Non-agency issuance picked up in October, nearing pre- pandemic levels. CRE bank loan growth in October and November remained weak, consistent with tightened bank lending standards. In the residential mortgage market, financing conditions remained highly accommodative for borrowers access- ing government-backed loans. Mortgage rates remained near historic lows, supporting robust loan originations. Credit continued to flow to higher-score borrowers who met standard conforming loan criteria while remaining tight for lower-score borrowers and for nonstandard mortgage products. The credit quality of mortgages was little changed, as the fraction of mortgages in forbear- ance held fairly steady, and the rate of transition into mortgage delinquency remained at pre-pandemic levels. Financing conditions in consumer credit markets re- mained generally accommodative for borrowers with relatively strong credit. Credit card balances and average credit limits on existing accounts contracted, on net, for all types of borrowers. However, auto loan balances continued to increase for higher-quality borrowers, and loan rates remained well below pre-pandemic levels. Conditions in the asset-backed securities market re- mained stable over the intermeeting period. Staff Economic Outlook In the U.S. economic projection prepared by the staff for the December FOMC meeting, real GDP growth was revised up and the unemployment rate revised down for the fourth quarter relative to the November meeting forecast. These revisions reflected incoming data that were, on balance, better than expected, although the re- cent resurgence of the pandemic and increased social- distancing restrictions in many states and localities were expected to weigh on economic activity in the coming months. As a result, the staff expected that real GDP growth would temporarily weaken in the first quarter of 2021, and the slowing seen in some of the most recent Page 6 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ high-frequency indicators of spending and employment appeared consistent with that forecast. The inflation forecast for the rest of 2020 was revised down slightly in response to incoming data, and inflation was projected to finish the year at a relatively subdued level, reflecting substantial margins of labor- and product-market slack in the economy and the large declines in consumer en- ergy prices seen earlier in 2020. Primarily in response to the recent favorable news on the development of COVID-19 vaccines, the staff re- vised up its projection of real GDP growth for 2021 as a whole, as social-distancing measures were expected to ease more quickly than previously assumed. With mon- etary policy assumed to remain highly accommodative, the staff continued to project that real GDP growth over the medium term would be well above the rate of poten- tial output growth, leading to a considerable further de- cline in the unemployment rate. The resulting take-up of labor- and product-market slack was expected to lead to gradually increasing inflation, and, for some time in the years beyond 2023, inflation was projected to over- shoot 2 percent by a moderate amount, as monetary pol- icy remained accommodative. The staff observed that the uncertainty related to the fu- ture course of the pandemic, the measures to control it, and the associated economic effects remained elevated. In addition, the staff continued to judge the risks to the economic outlook as being tilted to the downside. The recent sharp resurgence in the pandemic suggested that the near-term risks had risen, while the recent favorable developments regarding vaccines pointed to some re- duction in the downside risks over the medium term. Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, participants submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and infla- tion for each year from 2020 through 2023 and over the longer run, based on their individual assessments of ap- propriate monetary policy, including the path of the fed- eral funds rate. The longer-run projections represented each participant’s assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, un- der appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy. A Summary of Eco- nomic Projections (SEP) was released to the public fol- lowing the conclusion of the meeting. Participants noted that the COVID-19 pandemic was causing tremendous human and economic hardship across the United States and around the world. Eco- nomic activity and employment had continued to re- cover but remained well below their levels at the begin- ning of the year. Weaker demand and earlier declines in oil prices had been holding down consumer price infla- tion. Overall financial conditions remained accommo- dative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses. Participants agreed that the path of the economy would depend on the course of the virus and that the ongoing public health crisis would continue to weigh on economic activity, employment, and inflation in the near term and posed considerable risks to the eco- nomic outlook over the medium term. Participants observed that the economy continued to show resilience in the face of the pandemic, though it was still far from having attained conditions consistent with the Committee’s dual mandate. They noted that the economic recovery thus far had been stronger than anticipated—suggesting greater momentum in eco- nomic activity than had been previously thought—but viewed the more recent indicators as signaling that the pace of recovery had slowed. With the pandemic wors- ening across the country, the expansion was expected to slow even further in coming months. Nevertheless, the positive vaccine news received over the intermeeting pe- riod was viewed as favorable for the medium-term eco- nomic outlook. Participants noted that household spending on goods, especially durables, had been strong. Participants com- mented that the rebound in consumer spending was due, in part, to fiscal programs such as federal stimulus pay- ments and expanded unemployment benefits. These measures had provided essential support to many house- holds. The support to incomes provided by fiscal pro- grams, combined with reduced spending by households on some services, had contributed to a historically large increase in aggregate household savings. Participants also observed that residential investment and home sales remained robust. Accommodative monetary policy was viewed as having provided support to interest rate sen- sitive expenditure categories, including residential in- vestment and consumer durables spending. Participants regarded the positive news on vaccine development as further strengthening the medium-term outlook for household spending. However, participants saw in- creased challenges for the economy in the coming months, as the ongoing surge of COVID-19 cases and the related mandatory and voluntary measures prompted greater social distancing and damped spending, espe- cially on services requiring in-person contact. Several Minutes of the Meeting of December 15–16, 2020 Page 7 _____________________________________________________________________________________________ participants pointed out that readings on high-frequency economic indicators, such as individual mobility indexes and online restaurant reservation data, might already be registering the effects of the recent rise in virus cases. Various participants noted that low-income households were particularly hard hit by the effects of the resurgent virus, and that—with the looming expiration of the ex- panded unemployment benefits, eviction moratoria, and loan forbearance programs—their situations could dete- riorate significantly if additional relief and support did not materialize. With respect to the business sector, participants ob- served that business equipment investment had picked up further, with strong readings registered on new or- ders and shipments. A couple of participants remarked that the very low levels of inventories would likely be a factor supporting increases in production as demand continued to recover. Participants noted that the eco- nomic recovery had been uneven across firms and in- dustries. Though many business contacts, particularly those in the durable goods or housing sectors, reported progress in adapting to the pandemic and improved business practices, others—especially those closely linked to the leisure, travel, and hospitality industries— were still struggling, and their problems were intensify- ing because of the resurgence of the virus. Furthermore, while larger firms were generally seen as recovering rea- sonably well, conditions remained worrisome for small businesses. A number of participants noted that many small businesses were in especially vulnerable positions and that further fiscal policy support would help such businesses weather the ongoing surge in the pandemic, especially over the coming months. Looking further ahead, participants observed that continuing positive de- velopments on the vaccine front could further support business investment by helping reduce stresses in pandemic-sensitive industries and by boosting confi- dence. Participants remarked that labor market conditions gen- erally had continued to improve, but they were still a long way from those consistent with the Committee’s maximum employment goal. Although the pace of em- ployment gains had moderated in recent months, the overall recovery in employment thus far had been faster than anticipated, with a little more than half of the 22 million jobs lost over March and April having been regained. The unemployment rate had declined further, although several participants underlined the fact that the labor force participation rate remained below its pre- pandemic level—likely reflecting, in part, health con- cerns and additional childcare responsibilities associated with online schooling. Participants assessed that the on- going surge in COVID-19 infections would be particu- larly challenging for the labor market in coming months, but they indicated that they expected employment to continue to recover over the medium term. Participants stressed that the burdens of the economic downturn had fallen unequally on different groups; in particular, high rates of job losses had been especially prevalent among lower-wage workers and among African Americans and Hispanics. Some participants expressed the concern that the longer the pandemic continued, the more lasting damage to the labor market there could be. They noted that the number of unemployed workers who had been permanently laid off had increased notably in recent months and that those workers historically often re- quired a longer time to find a new job than those tem- porarily laid off. In light of these considerations, several participants assessed that improvements in the labor market were lagging that of economic activity, and they indicated that they had not revised their projections of labor market variables to the same extent as their revi- sion of the outlook for economic activity. In their comments about inflation, participants noted that increases in consumer prices had been soft of late, as prices of products in those categories most affected by social distancing—such as hotel accommodations and air travel—continued to be depressed and increases in rents remained low. These patterns were expected to continue in the near term as pandemic concerns intensi- fied over the winter. However, participants generally saw these downward pressures on inflation starting to abate next year, with widespread distribution of vaccines reducing social-distancing concerns and spurring eco- nomic activity. A couple of participants suggested that, as a result of ongoing technology-enabled disruption to business models and practices or lasting pandemic- induced restraint on firms’ pricing power, downward pressure on inflation could persist. Several participants noted a pickup in market-based measures of inflation compensation. Participants expected that, with contin- ued monetary policy support, inflation would rise over time. In their SEP submissions, seven participants— five more than in the September SEP—expected overall inflation to be above the Committee’s 2 percent longer- run objective in 2023. Participants noted that overall financial conditions were accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to house- holds and businesses. However, participants underlined important differences in credit availability across bor- rowers. Financing conditions eased further for large Page 8 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ corporations that were able to access capital markets, as equity prices rose and corporate credit spreads contin- ued to narrow, but smaller firms and some households reliant on bank lending continued to face tight lending standards. Participants noted that the financing condi- tions for small businesses were especially strained, with a few participants pointing out that a sizable fraction of small businesses had permanently closed or were in the process of transitioning to closure. A couple of partici- pants observed that aggregate banking data had not in- dicated a significant increase in loan delinquencies for C&I loans thus far, though this development could be partly due to the CARES Act provisions that provided relief to many troubled borrowers or to the fact that many small businesses had gone out of business without declaring bankruptcy or defaulting on loans. Some par- ticipants noted the important role played by the various section 13(3) facilities implemented in 2020 in serving as temporary backstops to key credit markets and in help- ing to restore and maintain the flow of credit to house- holds, businesses, and communities. These participants also mentioned the announcement that CARES Act funding to support new activity in many of these facili- ties would not be available after December 31, and a number noted that they saw downside risks associated with this development. Participants continued to see the uncertainty surround- ing the economic outlook as elevated, with the path of the economy highly dependent on the course of the vi- rus. The positive vaccine news was seen as reducing downside risks over the medium term, and a number of participants saw risks to economic activity as more bal- anced than earlier. Still, participants saw significant un- certainties regarding how quickly the deployment of vac- cines would proceed as well as how different members of the public would respond to the availability of vac- cines. Participants cited several downside risks that could threaten the economic recovery. These risks in- cluded the possibility of significant additional fiscal pol- icy support not materializing in a timely manner, the po- tential for further adverse pandemic developments— which could lead to more-stringent restrictions, more- severe business failures, and more permanent job losses—and the chance that trade negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union would not be concluded successfully before the December 31 deadline. As upside risks, participants mentioned the prospect that the release of pent-up demand, spurred by wider-scale vaccinations and easing of social distancing, could boost spending and bring individuals back to the labor force more quickly than currently expected as well as the possibility that fiscal policy developments could see measures that were larger than expected in amount or economic impact. Regarding inflation, participants generally viewed the risks as having become more bal- anced than they were earlier in the year, though most still viewed the risks as being weighted to the downside. As an upside risk to inflation, a few participants noted the potential for a stronger-than-expected recovery, coupled with the possible emergence of pandemic-related supply constraints, to boost inflation. In their consideration of monetary policy at this meeting, participants reaffirmed the Federal Reserve’s commit- ment to using its full range of tools to support the U.S. economy during this challenging time, thereby promot- ing the Committee’s statutory goals of maximum em- ployment and price stability. Participants agreed that the path of the economy would depend significantly on the course of the virus and that the ongoing public health crisis would continue to weigh on economic activity, em- ployment, and inflation in the near term. Participants noted that, with the pandemic worsening across the country, the expansion would likely slow in coming months. In contrast, for the medium term, participants commented that positive vaccine news had improved the economic outlook. That said, participants agreed that the path ahead remained highly uncertain and that the economy remained far from the Committee’s longer- run goals. In light of this assessment, all participants judged that maintaining an accommodative stance of monetary policy was essential to foster economic recov- ery and to achieve an average inflation rate of 2 percent over time. All participants supported enhancing the Committee’s guidance on asset purchases at this meeting and, in par- ticular, adopting qualitative, outcome-based guidance in- dicating that increases in asset holdings would continue, with purchases of Treasury securities of at least $80 bil- lion per month and of agency MBS of at least $40 billion per month, until substantial further progress has been made toward reaching the Committee’s maximum em- ployment and price stability goals. In their discussions of this change, participants noted that the new guidance regarding balance sheet policy brought the statement’s references to purchases into better alignment with the Committee’s outcome-based guidance on the federal funds rate, offered more clarity about the role played by the asset purchase program in providing accommoda- tion to meet the Committee’s economic goals, and un- derscored the responsiveness of balance sheet policy to unanticipated economic developments. A few partici- pants stressed that all of the Committee’s policy tools Minutes of the Meeting of December 15–16, 2020 Page 9 _____________________________________________________________________________________________ were now well positioned to respond to the evolution of the economy. For example, if progress toward the Com- mittee’s goals proved slower than anticipated, the new guidance relayed the Committee’s intention to respond by increasing monetary policy accommodation through maintaining the current level of the target range of the federal funds rate for longer and raising the expected path of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet. A couple of participants remarked that, against this background, it was important to convey to the public that the federal funds rate remained the Committee’s primary policy tool. A number of participants discussed considerations re- lated to determining the eventual attainment of “sub- stantial further progress” toward reaching the Commit- tee’s maximum employment and price stability goals. Participants commented that this judgment would be broad, qualitative, and not based on specific numerical criteria or thresholds. Various participants noted the im- portance of the Committee clearly communicating its as- sessment of actual and expected progress toward its longer-run goals well in advance of the time when it could be judged substantial enough to warrant a change in the pace of purchases. Regarding the decisions on the pace and composition of the Committee’s asset purchases, all participants judged that it would be appropriate to continue those purchases at least at the current pace, and nearly all favored main- taining the current composition of purchases, although a couple of participants indicated that they were open to weighting purchases of Treasury securities toward longer maturities. Participants generally judged that the asset purchase program as structured was providing very significant policy accommodation. Some participants noted that the Committee could consider future adjust- ments to its asset purchases—such as increasing the pace of securities purchases or weighting purchases of Treas- ury securities toward those that had longer remaining maturities—if such adjustments were deemed appropri- ate to support the attainment of the Committee’s objec- tives. A few participants underlined the importance of continuing to evaluate the balance of costs and risks as- sociated with asset purchases against the benefits arising from purchases. Participants shared their views on the appropriate evo- lution of asset purchases once substantial further pro- gress had been made toward the Committee’s maximum employment and price stability goals. A number of par- ticipants noted that, once such progress had been at- tained, a gradual tapering of purchases could begin and the process thereafter could generally follow a sequence similar to the one implemented during the large-scale purchase program in 2013 and 2014. Committee Policy Action In their discussion of monetary policy for this meeting, members agreed that the COVID-19 pandemic was causing tremendous human and economic hardship across the United States and around the world. They noted that economic activity and employment had con- tinued to recover but remained well below their levels at the beginning of the year and that weaker demand and earlier declines in oil prices had been holding down con- sumer price inflation. Overall financial conditions re- mained accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses. Members agreed that the Federal Reserve was committed to using its full range of tools to support the U.S. economy in this chal- lenging time, thereby promoting its maximum employ- ment and price stability goals. Members also stated that the path of the economy would depend significantly on the course of the virus. In addition, members agreed that the ongoing public health crisis would continue to weigh on economic activity, employment, and inflation in the near term and was posing considerable risks to the economic outlook over the medium term. All members reaffirmed that, in accordance with the Committee’s goals to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run and with inflation running persistently below this longer- run goal, they would aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and longer-term inflation expecta- tions remain well anchored at 2 percent. Members ex- pected to maintain an accommodative stance of mone- tary policy until those outcomes were achieved. All members agreed to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent, and they expected that it would be appropriate to maintain this target range until labor market conditions had reached levels con- sistent with the Committee’s assessments of maximum employment and inflation had risen to 2 percent and was on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time. In addition, members agreed that it would be appropri- ate for the Federal Reserve to continue to increase its holdings of Treasury securities by at least $80 billion per month and agency MBS by at least $40 billion per month until substantial further progress had been made toward the Committee’s maximum employment and price sta- bility goals. They judged that these asset purchases Page 10 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ would help foster smooth market functioning and ac- commodative financial conditions, thereby supporting the flow of credit to households and businesses. Members agreed that, in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, they would continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and that they would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate in the event that risks emerged that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals. Members also agreed that, in as- sessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, they would take into account a wide range of information, in- cluding readings on public health, labor market condi- tions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the fol- lowing domestic policy directive, for release at 2:00 p.m.: “Effective December 17, 2020, the Federal Open Market Committee directs the Desk to: • Undertake open market operations as nec- essary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of 0 to ¼ percent. • Increase the System Open Market Ac- count holdings of Treasury securities by $80 billion per month and of agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) by $40 billion per month. • Increase holdings of Treasury securities and agency MBS by additional amounts and purchase agency commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) as needed to sustain smooth functioning of markets for these securities. • Conduct term and overnight repurchase agreement operations to support effective policy implementation and the smooth functioning of short-term U.S. dollar funding markets. • Conduct overnight reverse repurchase agreement operations at an offering rate of 0.00 percent and with a per-counterparty limit of $30 billion per day; the per- 6 The statement approved at the meeting included a drafting error. By notation vote shortly after the meeting concluded, counterparty limit can be temporarily in- creased at the discretion of the Chair. • Roll over at auction all principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of Treasury securities and reinvest all princi- pal payments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of agency debt and agency MBS in agency MBS. • Allow modest deviations from stated amounts for purchases and reinvestments, if needed for operational reasons. • Engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate set- tlement of the Federal Reserve’s agency MBS transactions.” The vote also encompassed approval of a statement for release.6 The following statement was released at 2:00 p.m.: “The Federal Reserve is committed to using its full range of tools to support the U.S. economy in this challenging time, thereby promoting its maximum employment and price stability goals. The COVID-19 pandemic is causing tremen- dous human and economic hardship across the United States and around the world. Economic activity and employment have continued to re- cover but remain well below their levels at the beginning of the year. Weaker demand and ear- lier declines in oil prices have been holding down consumer price inflation. Overall finan- cial conditions remain accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the econ- omy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses. The path of the economy will depend signifi- cantly on the course of the virus. The ongoing public health crisis will continue to weigh on economic activity, employment, and inflation in the near term, and poses considerable risks to the economic outlook over the medium term. The Committee seeks to achieve maximum em- ployment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. With inflation running per- sistently below this longer-run goal, the Com- mittee will aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation the Committee unanimously approved a corrected version of the statement for release at 2:00 p.m. Minutes of the Meeting of December 15–16, 2020 Page 11 _____________________________________________________________________________________________ averages 2 percent over time and longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent. The Committee expects to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these outcomes are achieved. The Com- mittee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and expects it will be appropriate to maintain this target range until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee’s assessments of maximum employment and in- flation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time. In addition, the Federal Reserve will continue to increase its holdings of Treasury securities by at least $80 billion per month and of agency mortgage-backed securities by at least $40 bil- lion per month until substantial further progress has been made toward the Committee’s maxi- mum employment and price stability goals. These asset purchases help foster smooth mar- ket functioning and accommodative financial conditions, thereby supporting the flow of credit to households and businesses. In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals. The Committee’s assessments will take into account a wide range of information, in- cluding readings on public health, labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation ex- pectations, and financial and international de- velopments.” Voting for this action: Jerome H.
